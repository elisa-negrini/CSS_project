This is a nazi regime. They want nazi things. They were given power by the people to explicitly do nazi things. They told you they would do nazi things. They are now going to do nazi things.

Why are we still pretending otherwise? What does naivete give you? A tiny pearl of comfort in and amongst the boots thudding on the pavement outside?

Denial will not keep you or your family safe. Delusion will not spare you from what is to come.

For ten years we have warned of this and for ten years people have sanewashed these nazi fucks and downplayed their nazi intentions and every other ridiculous emotional salve to try and ignore the plain and obvious facts that these people are nazis and they are intending to do nazi things.

This is what is happening. The time for pretending and disbelieving and hoping and all that other fucking garbage is over. The nazis won. The bad guys are here.

If you want to understand what's happening here, specifically, Elon Musk knows Donald Trump is a walking corpse and he's intentionally trying to steal the nazi zeitgeist from him. He continually steals the spotlight by going further nazi than Trump, by soaking up the attention, and now by signalling to all the nazi militias out there that ""he's their guy"". 

He can't (yet) legally become President, but he's going to continue to leech all the attention and spotlight away from Donald Trump and try to capture his base, because Donald Trump's one mini-stroke away from being weekend-at-Bernie and Musk knows it and is making moves.

That's what this is. A myopic powerplay by a emotionally dead sociopath to steal a cultural movement. That's why he bought Twitter, that's why he helped steal the election for Trump, and now he's trying to win over the hearts and minds of all the nazi militias out there so that Donald Trump and his handlers can't simply cart Musk away when he irritates the shit out of them.

Do you remember the odd PA reference Trump dropped the other day? Which sounded suspiciously as though he were throwing Musk under the bus for illegal activity in PA? 

That's Trump's version of warning Elon to stay in his place, less the long arm of justice find him for trying to hog the spotlight.

So now we have a game of chicken by two emotionally dead billionaire fucks with the maturity of a ten year old. 

Go look at the front page of reddit right now. See any pictures of Trump? Nope. It's wall-to-wall Elon. He's capturing and soaking up all the attention, because that's how he do. He knows exactly what he's doing and he's doing it on purpose.

This was all *painfully* fucking obvious before the election. We warned and warned and America did not fucking listen because America is largely a nation of emotional infants that purposefully choose to drown reality away in propaganda so they don't have to reconcile with the reality in front of them. 

Is Elon Musk a ""true believer?"" No. None of these people on the stage are true believers in anything other than themselves. If there's a nazi zeitgeist that offers them power, they'll jump on it. They don't give a fuck. They do not see you or anyone else around them as human beings. They are gigantic goldfish with infinitely short memories gorging on endless wealth and capital and they'll put you in fucking camps if it gave them a nickel.

It’s from They Thought They Were Free by Milton Mayer, describing the average Germans during Nazi Germany https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.htm

In particular, your line about being called an alarmist made me think of these lines:

You see,” my colleague went on, “one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

“Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’

“And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.

“But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.

“But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.

“And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.",43,2025-01-21 06:36:49,4,False
