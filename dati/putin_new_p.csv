1me937b,Trump Threatens Putin Ally After He Dared To Compare Him To ‘Sleepy Joe’,huffpost,99,2025-07-31T18:16:33,huffpost,6,"From reporter Elyse Wanshel:

Here’s hoping a war of words doesn’t escalate into an actual war.

President Donald Trump expressed outrage in the wee hours of Monday morning after Dmitry Medvedev, the former president of Russia, needled him on social media with a comparison to former U.S. President Joe Biden.

Earlier in July, Trump said he would impose “secondary tariffs” against Russia if the country’s current president, Vladimir Putin, did not agree to a ceasefire deal with Ukraine within 50 days. But on Monday, Trump made the impromptu announcement that the two countries, which have been embroiled in a three-year war, now have only 10 more days to strike a deal.

And it seems that Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, wasn’t thrilled about it.

But on Monday, Trump [made the impromptu announcement](http://thedailybeast.com/trump-axes-putins-50-day-deadline-with-definitive-new-date/) that the two countries, which have been embroiled in a three-year war, now have only 10 more days to strike a deal.

&gt;And it seems that Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, wasn’t thrilled about it.

&gt;“Trump’s playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10…,” [Medvedev wrote Monday on X](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1949870764938711343), formerly Twitter. “He should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn’t Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road!”

&gt;“Russia and the USA do almost no business together,” [Trump wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114945847973193713). “Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!”

&gt;Trump’s “failed president” jab was likely a reference to [Medvedev’s single term as Russia’s leader, from 2008 to 2012](http://huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/russian-prime-minister-dmitry-medvedev-resigns_in_5e1f1985c5b63211760c21a4). Medvedev’s single term was controversial, and it was viewed by many as a placeholder presidency because Russian law prevented Putin from serving three consecutive terms.

Two insecure men throwing insults at each other but Medvedev is stupid to keep war mongering.  Ukraine has been whipping their ass, the US has the resources to do far worse and Russia doesn't have the resources including personnel to get into a war with the US.  

Not without China's help.",2025-07-31T18:50:14

Medvedev isn’t some guy who was president and lost reelection. He was literally only president in name only, installed by Putin, because at the time Russia still had limitations to how long a president could serve. Putin was the Russian leader before, after, and *during* Medvedev. Calling him “failed” isn’t some dig that’s going to hurt him.

Even if Putin was pulling the strings, there are vast swaths of policy and the actual presidential job he doesn't give a shit about and is more than happy to delegate, as long as they don't fuck it up. 

Now he's been relegated to the bench. Vice-chairman of the Security Council is a job with no formal duties or powers and which didn't exist before Putin created it as a retirement gig for Dima. But he still wants to be president again (and for real) some day, to succeed Putin. Since he was known as a very-relatively-speaking liberal and West-friendly figure within United Russia, Putin allegedly made sure he knew on no uncertain terms that no dissent would be permitted when he launched his invasion in 2022. So he did a total about-face and has since then acted as Putin's attack dog, because western media still pays some attention to his tweets because he was president (even if in-name-only) and because it doesn't conform to how they expect ex-presidents to act. Which they really shouldn't since he's domestically not that relevant at all and everything he says is just calculated to try to stoke outrage. Poorly calculated much of the time, hence a lot of deleted Tweets where he e.g. threatened WWIII over lines that were in fact crossed with impunity.",2025-07-31T19:40:40

However, they warn that while the Kremlin does not appear hugely troubled by the latest threats, it may be genuinely worried that an unpredictable Trump could make things difficult for Russia.

Responding to [Trump’s threat to impose new sanctions within “10 or 12 days”](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/putin-is-going-to-call-trumps-bluff-3830935?ico=in-line_link) if Moscow fails to show good faith – as opposed to an original 50-day deadline – Russian Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov told the newspaper *Izvestia* that “Moscow has no intention of caving to pressure”.

“The ultimatum itself was not taken seriously, neither the 50 days nor the 10-12 day one,” read another article in the Russian daily.

The former prime minister and now Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev took to X, comparing Trump to “Sleepy Joe \[Biden\]”, warning him not to “step towards war… with his own country”.

Medvedev also hit back at Russia hawk and US senator Lindsey Graham, who earlier wrote on social media that “to those in Russia who believe that [President Trump](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-being-outsmarted-putin-xi-3826389?ico=in-line_link) is not serious… you and your customers will soon be sadly mistaken”. Medvedev replied: “It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’”, adding: “Work on America first, gramps!”",2025-07-29T16:29:51
1mcg4fg,Trump's threats are becoming a joke - but his latest may have rattled Putin,theipaper,14,2025-07-29T16:29:39,theipaper,2,"The bullish response and the mocking tone of some Russian officials is no surprise to Dr Stephen Hall, lecturer in Russian politics at the University of Bath.

“Russia will be throwing a lot of narratives at the wall and seeing what sticks, including, yes, that \[Trump’s\] a bit of a joke, that Russia can get through this, that Trump is the same as sleepy Joe Biden… and they will always refer back to ‘Taco’,” Hall told *The i Paper*, referring to the [“Trump Always Chickens Out” acronym](https://inews.co.uk/news/all-times-taco-trump-chickened-out-tariffs-3721800?srsltid=AfmBOoq04XLSB9NLlLv2Fu6Jn5RdwC_b5uRp5rRESy9MnPEm-Ayy06rj&amp;ico=in-line_link) that originated in the US, but which has since permeated throughout Russian social media.

“Generally, they are not going to take it very seriously,” agreed Dr Marcin Kaczmarski, a Russian foreign expert at the University of Glasgow.

He told *The i Paper*: “The Kremlin still hopes to get two things at the same time. Rapprochement from the US and turning that relationship into one that works for them, while not giving up on any of their maximalist demands in Ukraine.”

When Trump first announced the 50-day deadline this month, Moscow’s stock exchange actually rose by 2.7 per cent. Monday’s announcement, [made alongside Sir Keir Starmer in Scotland](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-likes-starmer-not-above-trolling-him-3829950?ico=in-line_link), was received less positively, with shares dropping by around 1 per cent.

Something that could seriously dent Russian oil revenue would be secondary tariffs on Russian trading partners, particularly [China](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-being-outsmarted-putin-xi-3826389?ico=in-line_link) and India – who purchased 47 per cent and 38 per cent of Russian crude oil in April, respectively, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

Trump said on Monday that he would “maybe” implement those secondary tariffs.

However, Kaczmarski is doubtful he will: “Trump seems to want a trade deal with China now. He won’t risk that deal with secondary sanctions.”

The US leader may be equally reluctant to upset India by shutting off their cheap Russian oil and gas, when in recent years it has been US foreign strategy to try and “peel off India from China”, Hall said.

Meanwhile, Trump’s threat to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Russian exports to the US “holds very little weight in a country that trades only a few billion dollars with the US annually,” said Professor Bülent Gökay, author of *The Politics of Oil*.",2025-07-29T16:30:11

The Russian business daily newspaper *Vedomosti*  quoted Pavel Koshkin, Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for US and Canada Studies in Moscow, as saying that Trump’s position on the war, which has traditionally been more sympathetic to Russia than Ukraine, was unlikely to change dramatically.

“US support for Ukraine through European partners will continue, but Trump is unlikely to endorse a genuinely tougher stance on Russia,” Koshkin said. 

Russian newspaper *Moskovsky Komsomolets* put Trump’s newest ultimatum down to the confidence boost the US President has received after a series of recent political wins, including closing a trade deal with the EU and taking some credit for a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia. “We have a Trump on a high from thinking how cool he is from foreign policy successes,” the newspaper reported on Tuesday morning.

*Nezavisimaya Gazeta*, another Russian daily, said he was “dizzy from success”.

But behind the bluster, the Kremlin may still be “genuinely worried”, said Hall. “Trump changes by the day, employing a sort of Mad Max persona which can be worrying for a regime that likes to know what the other side is thinking.”

This was perhaps reflected in the daily press briefing given by Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, in which he said Moscow had “recorded a slowdown in the process of normalising bilateral relations” with Washington.

“As always, the Kremlin will just play the waiting game and see what is going to happen,” said Hall. “They will watch this space to see if Trump follows through – which he hasn’t been particularly good at so far.”",2025-07-29T16:30:19

The US President had previously seemed to lose his temper with his Russian counterpart, setting a deadline for Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. On Monday, he went further, cutting that deadline to just “10 or 12 days” because there was “no reason” to wait any longer, given the total lack of visible progress towards his goal.

Trump is often easily dismissed by those who don’t like him, not least because the volatile US President never seems to stick to a particular course of action. He has threatened huge tariffs and trade wars so many times that there is now even an acronym for it – [Taco, or Trump Always Chickens Out](https://inews.co.uk/news/trumps-taco-dilemma-two-week-pause-iran-risks-chicken-out-3762532?srsltid=AfmBOop7I3XQDn9pb4wHgMcnsrc1GRFcpJ3MaC-ogZXZgw8Y6To0XvhD&amp;ico=in-line_link).

But in reality, on his own terms at least, Trump has won many of the fights that he’s picked. Even before he took office, Trump took on big tech over what he alleged [was “censorship” of conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57754435) – and was rewarded with millions of dollars in donations to his inauguration, public apologies, and the CEOs of the tech giants lining up around him on the podium.

Trump took on America’s law firms for representing his adversaries – a constitutionally-protected right – and many of them folded, signing agreements to do pro bono work representing causes the US President supports and to cut down on activities he doesn’t, such as [diversity, equity, and inclusion programmes](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/mark-zuckerberg-sounded-death-knell-all-diversity-initiatives-3481729?srsltid=AfmBOoogmplZA6gc7XX4GtBguaEgnYJPirMeQI4GDhewibPlJPci2x3y&amp;ico=in-line_link).

Trump has fought the US media and won, with the CBS network settling a multi-million-dollar lawsuit with Trump over a *60 Minutes* interview segment with Kamala Harris. Almost every independent legal analyst in America believes CBS would have triumphed if the case had come to court, but CBS’s parent company, Paramount, [reportedly did not want Trump to block a merger deal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-to-pay-16-million-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-over-60-minutes-interview-fd8dd21c) – so it folded.",2025-07-29T14:44:46
1mcdc4o,Putin is going to call Trump's bluff - and the US President can't 'chicken out',theipaper,121,2025-07-29T14:44:30,theipaper,6,"And even on tariff policy, where Trump has seemed to publicly cave so often, he is – on his own terms at least – winning. Ursula von der Leyen [agreed to blanket US tariffs of 15 per cent](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-set-stage-colossal-trade-war-could-spiral-out-of-control-3802860?ico=in-line_link) on EU goods exported to the US, without any retaliation or trade war, something that would’ve been seen as impossible just months ago. That is still a hefty new tax that US consumers will pay, but it was the policy Trump wanted, and he got it; the EU folded.

Now, it’s Putin’s turn. The US could certainly do plenty to back up Trump’s threats. Sanctions need to be constantly updated and extended to remain effective, and Trump hasn’t done this since taking office. Merely renewing these would tighten the financial noose on Russia.

Putting financial pressure, such as sanctions or tariffs, on Russia’s allies would do the same. Trump could accelerate arms sales to Ukraine, or even resume financial aid. There are plenty of options available to Trump if Putin does nothing, and the US President has the will to follow through.

The question is whether or not his heart is really in the fight. Trump has very obviously wanted some kind of deal and rapprochement with Putin and Russia for a long time, and Putin has been confident that he can wait it out and get a deal on his own terms.

Putin doesn’t have to worry about the niceties that democratic leaders do – he has almost no domestic political opposition and isn’t constrained by elections. He can grind it out, securing his goals, whatever the human cost.

Putin will almost certainly test Trump and make him prove that his threats are serious – he will call Trump’s bluff. Then, the question for Trump and the world becomes whether or not he actually means it, and will follow through with action against Russia.

The problem here is that no one, quite probably including Trump himself, knows the answer, and it may even change from day to day. The stakes, especially for Ukrainians being bombarded day after day, couldn’t be higher – but Trump doesn’t yet even seem sure what game he’s playing.

1mc5zwo,Trump is being outsmarted by Putin and Xi,theipaper,249,2025-07-29T08:30:49,theipaper,11,"Late last year as he was campaigning to return to the White House, [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?srsltid=AfmBOoqUJOsox8tSs3178O5J61w50bR_DqZuidT63GrzOIlc9RelXdNS&amp;ico=in-line_link) said that if elected, he would work hard to “ununite” China and Russia.

Foreign policy experts have dubbed this Trump’s “reverse Nixon strategy”. They are referring to Richard Nixon’s diplomatic coup when he met Chinese leader Mao Zedong, ending over 20 years of hostility with communist China and breaking Beijing’s alliance with [Moscow](https://inews.co.uk/topic/moscow?srsltid=AfmBOorabuuRB8Be5T8VNvBLzk_3bDkpR6LKYCy7DCsHocPH2ZJx76VW&amp;ico=in-line_link).

Back then, Washington was able to exploit the multiple frictions that had built up in relations between the brotherly communist states and included military clashes over a disputed section of their border in 1969.

Today, the US has no such possibility. Over the past 30 years, China and Russia have built a relationship around common interests that is highly pragmatic, flexible and resilient to shocks. They are united by their [determination to reduce Western dominance](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/xi-moscow-meeting-putin-power-move-message-trump-3682825?ico=in-line_link) of international affairs and create what they term a “just” global order based on non-Western norms and values.

This does not mean to say that China and Russia do not have differences. They do, but they are manageable. For example, the Chinese leadership was reportedly unimpressed by Moscow’s decision late last year to [deepen relations with North Korea](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/north-korea-gaining-sensitive-tech-wealth-russia-weakness-3481928?srsltid=AfmBOoqAgGiZAQIsSuTdD17KZFWfUeLrQ5fXK1QAyGireSyAhuh0UMuI&amp;ico=in-line_link) to support its war in Ukraine. Chinese policymakers fear that the signing of a [mutual defence](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-north-korea-visit-weapons-war-support-3117028?srsltid=AfmBOorI67LUJfICJAOfvi5w2fbg-4CzKlLJ-kdy4m4nhBhKwTvRR5kG&amp;ico=in-line_link) treaty by the two countries might complicate Beijing’s relations with Pyongyang.

Like Russia, China sees divisions and weakness in the West, but its [instinct is to play the long game](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-kickstarted-americas-downfall-world-china-3634001?ico=in-line_link) and seek evolutionary change in international affairs. By contrast, Moscow is in a hurry, and its approach is revolutionary. It wants to break what remains of Western unity and exploit the emerging chaos to dictate the establishment of a new security architecture in Europe, one that restores an exclusive zone of Russian interest.

This explains [Vladimir Putin’s](https://inews.co.uk/topic/vladimir-putin?srsltid=AfmBOoq7R52rpNP0gW4QzHZS2LD0EmhTuJyGGM8avfQoozEJfBiCA4i8&amp;ico=in-line_link) decision to unleash [full-scale war on Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia-ukraine-war?srsltid=AfmBOopffB_kcDqUwvIQCCNghZNVyuk8x5Nnn_kqfsMNWR8XuqgcvOYd&amp;ico=in-line_link). Despite its stated neutrality in the conflict and a platitudinous “peace plan” drawn up with Brazil, China has stood by Russia’s side and [enabled it to continue fighting](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/xi-supercharge-russia-war-red-line-3059759?ico=in-line_link).

1mc5zwo,Trump is being outsmarted by Putin and Xi,theipaper,249,2025-07-29T08:30:49,theipaper,4,"Not only does China buy about 50 per cent of Russia’s crude oil exports, it also imports Russian gas, providing Moscow with vitally needed income that has been sharply reduced from Western sources because of sanctions and other changes in trade patterns since February 2022.

In addition, China exports dual-use technologies such as machine tools and components that are used in the defence industry to produce weapons. Around 70 per cent of Russia’s machine tool imports come from China and about 90 per cent of imported microelectronics.

According to a recent Bloomberg report, 92 per cent of the foreign parts found in Russian drones used against targets in Ukraine originate in China. These include electronics, cameras, engines, antennas and navigations modules. Last week, Ukraine’s GUR defence intelligence agency claimed that it had discovered for the first time a drone made entirely from Chinese components.

Bulldozers delivered from China played a key role in Russia’s ability to build defensive lines in Ukraine in early 2023 that thwarted Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the summer of 2024.

As the Chinese foreign minister told the EU’s foreign policy chief in early July in a rare moment of candour, Beijing cannot afford to see Russia defeated in Ukraine because this would allow the US to focus its full attention on China. This suggests China is comfortable with the war continuing if it does not escalate to dangerous levels.

According to Chinese accounts, in March 2023, [Xi Jinping](https://inews.co.uk/topic/xi-jinping?srsltid=AfmBOopZ-1uD4C8F_2ZvRH3Jl1cTDlWnIVbyH-zAYxnmt-fQjPXWXvPg&amp;ico=in-line_link) warned Putin against threatening to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The Russian leader’s nuclear rhetoric had caused considerable alarm in Washington and persuaded the Biden administration that the defeat of Russia’s army in Ukraine would be an undesirable outcome because of the risk of escalation.

However, just as it is impossible to prove that Putin was bluffing, there is no evidence to show that his threats were serious. The Russians have also not admitted that there was Chinese intervention to calm the waters.",2025-07-29T08:31:28

Say trump declares war on china and he's not removed immediately;

* china can just frame it as liberating US from trump
* dems promise pardons for all broken contracts to be renewed after the inevitable civil war
* Then trump gets couped and jailed for being a pedophile

That sounds by design, so I'm calling it;  
China has a secret alliance with Russia to bring the USA down and make China #1  
Simple, make them civil war by stoking their racism and abusing their voting system to install trump, a russian asset with no morals, controlled by Epstein kompromat that they can throw under the bus once he's done enough while maintaining plausible distance between them

There's no other reason why the first things he did in office was start dismantling it, sell the wiring and set the rest on fire  
Or why he was wishy-washy with ukraine aid, but bombs Iran *for the actor that broke negotiations with them.*

China gets to look like the good guy because russia plays the bad bad guy and trump plays the insane bad guy. After WW3, assuming any other countries actually help trump, ALL contracts and alliances are reopened for negotiations with heavy restrictions on USA a'la WW2 japan. Because wtf USA for aiding and abetting trump into power and defending his traitorous actions

All because trumps not being removed from power because democrats want to ""follow the rules"". They're just focused on paddling at the same pace to get to land, the midterms, while the boats being destroyed around them by a foreign agent in orange makeup",2025-07-29T08:42:27

We interviewed over 200 witnesses and reviewed over one million pages of documents. No probe into this matter has been more exhaustive.*

 

*“We can say, without any hesitation, that the Committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election.*

 

*“What the Committee did find however is very troubling. We found irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling. And we discovered deeply troubling actions taken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, particularly their acceptance and willingness to rely on the ‘Steele Dossier’ without verifying its methodology or sourcing.* 

 

*“Now, as we head towards the 2020 elections, China and Iran have joined Russia in attempts to disrupt our democracy, exacerbate societal divisions, and sow doubts about the legitimacy and integrity of our institutions, our electoral process and our republic.*

 

*“We must do better in 2020. The Committee’s five reports detail the signs and symptoms of that interference and show us how to protect campaigns, state and local entities, our public discourse, and our democratic institutions. I join with Vice Chairman Warner in urging everyone — our colleagues, those in the Administration, state and local elections officials, the media, and the American public — to read them and take the recommendations seriously.”*

Responding to President Trump’s ultimatum to Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin that he “accept a peace deal with Ukraine within 50 days or face new secondary sanctions,” Rice said, “I think the best news that we could possibly give to the Ukrainian people is that the United States and Europe have finally aligned around the idea that Vladimir Putin will not be stopped with words. He will only be stopped if he believes that he can go no further, he can win no further.” Rice suggested that American and European alignment on handling Russia marks a “turning point” in the Ukraine conflict, raising the prospect of additional weapons deliveries and support for the embattled nation. Rice also discussed the possible challenges of enforcing secondary sanctions on entities doing business with Russia, and shared her view on why it’s not a bad thing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is jointly serving as National Security Advisor. ",2025-07-21T21:12:00

If you need a historical example, you can look at the late Roman Republic with Sulla and Marius - they broke Roman political norms, which accelerated with their successors, Pompeii and Caesar. This is probably where we're at with Trump. 

As for the Supreme Court, they're not the executor. As long as they don't subordinate to Trump, it'll take some time to strengthen the judiciary.

Trump has said he is “very disappointed” with Putin for continuing to bomb Ukrainian cities, and has given him 50 days to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine – or risk draconian new [sanctions](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sanctions-against-russia?srsltid=AfmBOorlwWCT8HCdtiGS3scNV16bhi97igllVft4QzDXSnrYQdnUoGXc&amp;ico=in-line_link).

But the latest deadline grants the Kremlin unexpected relief, with 50 days of breathing room to continue [attacking Ukraine with drones and missiles](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/how-putin-deadly-new-drone-strategy-changing-war-ukraine-3800208?ico=in-line_link) as sanctions will remain on hold.

“I don’t think that the idea of a 50-day deadline is a good one, not least because Trump is known for issuing deadlines and then backing down as he did multiple times with tariffs,” said Michael Spagat, international conflict expert and professor at the University of London.

Since he returned to the White House in January, Trump has already issued numerous threats and deadlines on economic and foreign policy issues – most [notably on trade tariffs](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trumps-flip-flopping-tariffs-everyone-loser-3639530?srsltid=AfmBOoqgpXnHiUcwVEaduKoB1xP1vnjoO-KZjoOAg-lEfyShlGm6pS7q&amp;ico=in-line_link) – that he has [consistently backed down on](https://inews.co.uk/news/all-times-taco-trump-chickened-out-tariffs-3721800?srsltid=AfmBOoqQvaJ22jTm3B_NEkzWA37OeX3nMFwZTnYm1pnFuRE9ANjEcpSO&amp;ico=in-line_link).

In May, Trump gave Putin a two-week deadline to come to a peace deal, which came and went with no repercussions for Moscow after it outmanoeuvred Trump through offering sham talks in Istanbul, which Putin did not even turn up to.

“I’m afraid that Trump created a trap for himself by setting the deadline and making threats that he seems very unlikely to carry out when pushed,” said Spagat.

“It seems like the most likely scenario is that Putin calls his bluff and he \[Trump\] backs down,” he said, adding that, potentially, Trump could blame the climbdown on Ukraine if Kyiv is emboldened by a boost of US weapons.

On Monday Trump announced that he would send more [weapons to Ukraine ](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-using-nato-as-middleman-to-deliver-weapons-to-ukraine-3802585?srsltid=AfmBOopHze-lU0sjboY4sUUNY53Xv6JmW3UuXJWdL9H7QY0Y9CgMoZn0&amp;ico=in-line_link)including Patriot air defence missiles.",2025-07-16T17:12:37
1m1iep9,Why Trump's 50-day Ukraine deadline is a trap - but not for Putin,theipaper,16,2025-07-16T17:12:13,theipaper,1,"# Action must back up words

Putin will not change his behaviour until he is forced to do so by action that hurts [Russia](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia?ico=in-line_link), militarily or economically, experts point out.

“I think that the only way to convince Putin to end the war is to convince him \[Trump\] that the US is really in it on Ukraine’s side for the long haul and is prepared to be patient,” Spagat said.

“This will also be hard for Trump because he’s monumentally impatient, hence all the short deadlines, and he’s wavered so much in support for Ukraine that I don’t see how he can be convincing that he’s in it for the long haul.”

“He needs to back up words with actions,” according to John Lough, Russia and Eurasia programme fellow at the London-based think-tank Chatham House. “He and the Europeans need to show that the Ukrainians are receiving more weapons and that he is serious about restricting Russia’s ability to sell oil.

A bipartisan bill in Congress would allow the president to levy a 500 per cent tariff on imports from countries that purchase Russian uranium, gas and oil.

The two senators leading the push to get the bill through Congress, one Democrat and one Republican, said on Monday following Trump’s remarks: “It is long overdue for the financial backers of Russia’s atrocities in Ukraine to pay a price for buying cheap energy products and marking it up in order to benefit their economies. The days of doing this without consequences are coming to an end.”

It is unclear if the secondary tariffs mentioned by Trump refer to the secondary sanctions package in the bill or a separate initiative.

Lough says Trump needs to allow the passage of the sanctions bill through Congress “and be ready to sign it into law if needed”.

But Trump could also help by providing Ukraine with more of the weapons they need to defend and attack the invading Russians. Exact details of the weaponry Trump announced on Monday are not yet known.

Some US media have suggested that Trump could send Ukraine Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of 1,600 to 2,500km – far longer than missiles currently in Ukraine’s arsenal.",2025-07-16T17:12:49
1m1iep9,Why Trump's 50-day Ukraine deadline is a trap - but not for Putin,theipaper,16,2025-07-16T17:12:13,theipaper,1,"On Tuesday a report said that on 4 July Trump had asked [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://inews.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky?srsltid=AfmBOoqQShMWgedanZDO68S9_7TgghV_jb0xJITgd2J10LZOPZPY-j2x&amp;ico=in-line_link) if Ukraine could hit Moscow and St Petersburg, following a “bad” phone call with Putin. Zelensky replied that Kyiv could if the US provided the country with long-range weapons, according to the *Financial Times*.

The White House said in response that Trump was “merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing”.

Ukraine has struck targets deep inside Russia this year with drones as well as missiles provided by the US and the UK.

In terms of allowing Ukraine to target more infrastructure on Russian territory, Lough believes Trump “won’t go that far and he doesn’t need to”.

“The Ukrainians need to be put into a better position to counter-attack and halt the Russian offensive. This will require the ability to strike supply lines and other military targets close to the front.”",2025-07-16T17:13:02

Trump’s new posture toward Putin may also be more about political performance than a true shift in tactics, shaped by both domestic and international pressures, according to Marina Miron, war studies researcher at King’s College London.

“I don’t think that Trump thinks he’s being played by Putin. Trump is very good at political theatre (…) and a lot of his statements are not because of Putin per se, but because of the pressure within his own party and also international pressure,” she said.

Miron emphasised that Trump’s approach to the war in Ukraine was ultimately driven by his perception of US interests, rather than a firm alignment with either side, and that any moves he makes should be viewed through that lens.

“He’s not on the Ukrainian side and he’s not on the Russian side. And I think this is something to understand in whatever he does. He will pursue American interests first,” said Miron.

Trump appears to be using both “a carrot and a stick” approach because “he got what he wanted at the Nato summit, for instance – he needs to appease the Europeans in a way, but in such a way that the Americans are not losing on this”.

Miron said: “I don’t think that it’s a substantial difference in his strategy. He’s trying to manoeuvre because we also have to understand that he’s not the only one who is making decisions. He still has a Congress, he has a House of Representatives. So he has to balance it out and he has to be very careful.

“So for Trump, it will be manoeuvring, trying not to alienate Russia, but in such a way as not to publicly show it,” she said. “For Trump, this is \[Joe\] Biden’s war.”",2025-07-16T17:13:15

In Moscow, officials and propagandists appear more relieved than anything following Trump’s announcement. The renewed threat of sanctions has not concerned the regime, which maintains that Russia’s economy has been redesigned successfully to withstand pressure from the West.

Russia is already among the most heavily sanctioned countries globally, facing penalties over a range of actions.

Miron pointed out that despite the multiple rounds of sanctions already imposed on Russia, certain commodities, like uranium for instance, that the US needs, are not affected by sanctions. “The sanctions are kind of, again, like a fog.”

“What is happening in the information sphere essentially is not what is being discussed behind closed doors,” she added.",2025-07-16T17:13:26

1m0mhbw,Trump Secretly Asked Zelensky if He Can Attack Moscow After His ‘Bad’ Call With Putin,FloridaGirlNikki,1305,2025-07-15T16:31:12,Zagmit,15,"To me this looks like a poorly calculated idea for how Trump might dispose of his 'Putin' problem. Trump wants to be close to Putin because he's powerful, but the Kremlin probably have some sort of blackmail material that would tank Trump's fragile administration, especially now that he's bungled his Epstein scandal. 


I think Trump was happy to play along while Russia's plans to seize Ukraine seemed feasible, but now that plan seems unrealistic and the war is increasingly dragging on. Trump now wants to bully and threaten Putin now that Trump realizes he can't give Putin what he wants. If Putin can't receive the carrot, Trump has to try and give him the stick, because neutrality/staying out of it might lead Putin to burning Trump out of spite. 


I think we might consider Trump has similar calculations about Pam Bondi now, because she might have seen incriminating information from the Epstein files about Trump, he'll feel the need to appease and protect her, but the moment he doesn't think that strategy will work he'll probably go on the attack. For the moment she's probably the only person in his administration that he wouldn't remove, but if she's somehow removed from power or forced to resign I might expect him to find a reason to have her arrested. ",2025-07-15T17:57:12

President Donald Trump says his wife, first lady Melania Trump, has emphasized to him privately that Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued attacks on Ukraine contradict the rosy picture the Russian leader often presents in phone calls with her husband.

While discussing new actions and threats aimed at pressuring Moscow to agree to a ceasefire deal, Trump twice on July 14 referenced remarks that Melania Trump ‒ who tends to keep a low profile ‒ has made to him in private about Russia's attacks.

""I go home, I tell the first lady, 'You know, I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.' And she said, 'Oh really? Another city was just hit,'"" Trump said during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office.

How drastically things have changed.

Having falsely labelled Ukraine’s President, [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://inews.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky?srsltid=AfmBOoqQShMWgedanZDO68S9_7TgghV_jb0xJITgd2J10LZOPZPY-j2x&amp;ico=in-line_link), a “dictator”, wrongly claimed he was responsible for the three-year war, and appearing to have more [sympathy with Vladimir Putin](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/what-trump-wants-from-russia-money-of-course-3545251?srsltid=AfmBOooZVX84Y49Ar9QEdcsn9Ao2NeuDYy3rTcCS-kcQrr0GbNHbmVkq&amp;ico=in-line_link), Trump has effectively made a 180-degree turn.

Trump confirmed the US would be providing Ukraine with the weapons it was seeking, including Patriot air defence missiles that are deemed crucial.

He said Nato member countries would buy “billions and billions” of dollars of US military equipment to be transferred to Ukraine.

Trump also announced he would be imposing “very severe tariffs” on [Russia](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia?srsltid=AfmBOorhohzRSiHEC_ksmmatahL0pL9nfpmtbi5_4RldcLf_DCUSW13R&amp;ico=in-line_link) if there were no peace deal within Ukraine in 50 days. He also threatened strict sanctions on anyone buying or exporting Russian oil unless Moscow made such an agreement.

Critics of Trump will point out that the 50-day deadline he is giving Moscow is another example of the US President refusing to press hard on the Kremlin. His second term has been full of fierce talk about fixed deadlines on tariffs and measures he will not walk back, only to see him do just that.

Trump's praise of Putin has always been seen as embarrassing, and not just by people on the left. Conservatives considered his behavior weak, naive or shameful from the beginning.

He had mostly exhausted his options for financial lenders in America and Europe, but corrupt dictators and governments all over the world might help him out (with election interference or bribes) if he played nice.

I'm sure that in their discussions Putin flattered trump by telling him he was the greatest American President of all time.

Of course, trump's uncontrollable narcissism prevented him from seeing how difficult it was for Putin to struggle against bursting into outright laughter as he wrapped trump around his little finger.

After years of naivety, and no doubt having had it pointed out to him many times by many different people, little donny trumpie has finally understood Putin's duplicity.

These ships always have Russian crews and are transporting Russian goods to ports with weaker customs oversight, and then bringing back embargoed goods.

Each of these ships is a prime target for interception and impoundment; but everybody is shy about pushing the rules of free navigation far enough to put a stop to them, because there is the very real possibility of Russia turning the waterways of the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and North Atlantic into a gray zone battlefield of sabotage, fire, and blood.",2025-07-14T17:20:28

Speaking in an Oval Office meeting with Mark Rutte, the Nato chief, Trump said: “We’re going to be doing secondary tariffs. If we don’t have a deal in 50 days, it’s very simple. And they’ll be at 100 per cent, and that’s the way it is.”

Trump also said that batteries of Patriot air-defence missiles would be sent to Ukraine “within days” in a big rethink of White House policy.

The White House caused alarm in Kyiv this month when it said it was pausing some arms deliveries to Ukraine, including some Patriot missiles, after a Pentagon review of US weapons stockpiles.

“Putin really surprised a lot of people. He talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening... I don’t like it,” Trump said Sunday evening, confirming that the U.S. will send weapons to Ukraine despite a Pentagon decision to halt military aid.

1lzm3wy,Hurt Trump Moans About Being Relentlessly Embarrassed by Putin,thedailybeast,299,2025-07-14T13:15:26,TranscendentPretzel,1,"This is exactly what Zelensky was trying to say in the Oval Office before Trump got defensive and interrupted to tell him he didn't have the cards. He was just saying that getting Putin to agree to a ceasefire is meaningless without a security guarantee from the U.S. because Putin will simply violate the ceasefire, as he has done in the past. Without a security guarantee from the U.S. there is no disincentive for Putin in violating it. In that scenario, Putin has all the cards, not the U.S., not ""master negotiator"" Trump. 


 Trump is such a dumb fuck and was so determined to humiliate Zelensky and show what a ""strong"" leader he is  because of his personal vendetta that he humiliated himself (and the entire fucking country, but that's neither here nor there). 


Here he is months later having learned from experience what should have been obvious to anyone with a brain, and what Zelensky told him that day that sent jd and Trump into a hissy fit. Putin does not honor treaties. Putin is not interested in deals. Putin will never come to the table in earnest. The only scenario where Putin capitulates would be if Russia becomes too crippled to continue this war...but as soon as they recover, he will pick up where he left off.

Trump doesn't need his supporters, He doesn't need opinion polls to be in his favour.

He is not running for re-election and **if** he even tries to hint at that then he still will not be needing his support base for that. (It will be illegal and thus most likely rigged). 

He is immune from prosecution, He has no resistance from the GOP.

Until we hit midterms then the Epstein hypocrisy is pretty much the only thing that's causing him some slight distress and that simply isn't enough at this point.

I hope Putin does keep doing the opposite of what Trump is saying he will do, I hope other world leaders start standing firmly up to Trump instead of trying to do sly side room deals to avoid making him angry.

One wholly unexpected lever Trump claimed he had at his disposal to ramp up pressure on Putin in leaked audio is – apparently – bombing the Russian capital.

An audio recording has emerged from Trump’s election campaign, in which during a private gathering of donors he can apparently be heard threatening to “bomb the sh\*t out of Moscow,” if Putin did not end his war.

“With Putin I said, ‘If you go into Ukraine, I’m going to bomb the sh\*t out of Moscow. I’m telling you I have no choice,’” Trump said during one 2024 fundraiser, according to the audio exclusively released to CNN. “And then \[Putin\] goes, like, ‘I don’t believe you.’ But he believed me 10 per cent.”

Trump later said he gave a similar warning to Chinese President Xi Jinping, stating that the US would bomb Beijing if China moved to invade Taiwan. “He thought I was crazy,” Trump said of Xi’s reaction, adding: “We never had a problem.”

However, analysts have cautioned against taking Trump’s remarks literally.

“We should be careful about taking Trump’s statements too seriously,” said Anders Puck Nielsen, a military analyst based in Denmark.

“He has several times before indicated that his patience with Russia was running out, but it has so far not materialised into action. At best, Trump has indicated a willingness to continue the deliveries of weapons approved during the Biden administration, and that is going to gradually taper off.”

“The trend is that American support for Ukraine is declining,” Nielsen pointed out. “It is, of course, good if Trump is beginning to understand that Putin is not looking to end the war, but it has taken him an inordinate amount of time to come to that realisation,” he said.

“And he does not seem willing to deliver the offensive weapons to Ukraine that would be required to put Russia under serious pressure. Some people thought Trump would be tougher than his predecessor and more willing to put Russia under pressure to end the war, but he has actually turned out to be even more submissive than Biden. And I don’t think we should expect that to change.”",2025-07-09T16:56:02
1lvnxio,"Trump 'threatened to bomb Moscow' - in reality, he's afraid to hurt Putin",theipaper,141,2025-07-09T16:55:29,theipaper,2,"# ‘We’ve been here before’

There are “plenty of things Trump could do” to pressure Putin, but so far he has failed to implement them, said John Foreman, associate fellow at the Chatham House think-tank in London and former UK defence attaché to Moscow.

They include supplying more weapons, instead of “half turn the tap back,” reducing the oil price cap via the G7, implementing new sanctions against Russia and its cronies, and even implementing “a no-fly zone over parts of Ukraine,” Foreman said.

“We’ve been here before when his irritation about the lack of progress in peace talks didn’t lead to concrete new action,” said Foreman.

“Trump has been pretty consistent on Russia for a decade. He’s all carrot, no stick. He blames both sides and regards it as not a massive issue for the US. He tries to use reason with Russia to achieve peace and a better bilateral relationship. Russia only respects the logic of force,” he said.

Foreman pointed out that Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff “is still promoting improved trade links between the US and Russia”, while Trump “doesn’t want to be seen to fail in bringing peace — that’s why the US backed away from the last round of talks.”

“Call me sceptical, but I’m not convinced he’s now going to change his approach dramatically. I see a lot of wishful thinking,” he said. “Even his decision on arms was half-hearted.”",2025-07-09T16:56:20

The mood on the ground in Ukraine echoes Nielsen’s remarks. “People are deservably sceptical, and the big reason is hours after Trump’s threats were made, Kyiv was under attack once again,” said Michael Bociurkiw, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and former spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

“Ukrainians, after three-plus years of war, are pretty sceptical that things may change any time quickly,” he said from the Ukrainian port city of Odesa.

Meanwhile, German Friedrich Merz told lawmakers in parliament on Wednesday that the diplomatic means for resolving the war are “exhausted” but Berlin will continue supporting Kyiv.

When asked on Tuesday to explain Trump’s approach to dealing with Putin, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said Trump is “an open-minded man, but he’s not naive.”

“He is principled and clear in what he wants to achieve. That’s what we’re seeing,” she added.",2025-07-09T16:56:33

&gt; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was ""pretty calm about this. Trump's way of talking is generally quite harsh, the phrases he uses.""

&gt; Last week, following a phone call with the Russian president, Trump said he was ""very unhappy"". ""He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it's no good,"" Trump said of Putin.

&gt; The criticism came even as the Trump administration announced a suspension of military aid to Ukraine, reportedly authorised by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Elbridge Colby, the under-secretary of defence for policy.

&gt; Asked by reporters on Tuesday who had taken the decision, Trump - sitting right next to Hegseth - replied: ""I don't know. Why don't you tell me?""

1lrk17o,Putin seems to view Trump as his personal plaything,theipaper,946,2025-07-04T14:25:49,theipaper,11,"[Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?srsltid=AfmBOorKljrTixh9A6RVg9Q2oeu0GBSGJ8drU3sHR1VWMlI3K1_et-Rr&amp;ico=in-line_link) wants the world to know that he is still “not happy” with [Vladimir Putin](https://inews.co.uk/topic/vladimir-putin?ico=in-line_link). That has been his position now for three straight months, since the US President [concluded in late April](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/zelensky-trump-meet-first-time-explosive-white-house-clash-3661784?srsltid=AfmBOopyDQXQku4J__gM51ZPQBzQXT_6ZeEjm65McDhht2D_EejPUpHD&amp;ico=in-line_link) that the Kremlin leader might simply be toying with him or, as he put it at the time, “tapping me along”.

On Thursday, the toying continued as the two men spent another hour talking to one another by telephone. It was their sixth publicly reported conversation since Trump returned to office, and as soon as it ended the White House conceded it had been essentially useless.

“I’m not happy…I didn’t make any progress with him today at all,” [the President told](https://x.com/cspan/status/1940883805100773544) reporters, describing himself as “very disappointed with the conversation”. After insisting on the campaign trail last year that he could solve the [war in Ukraine ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia-ukraine-war?ico=in-line_link)on his first day in office, Trump now finds himself reduced to a regular diet of public grousing about Putin. Yet he has unleashed no reprisals against the Russian president to end Moscow’s foot-dragging and prod the war towards its end. “I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad,” shrugged Trump on Thursday, again providing zero indication of any consequences for the Russian leader.

Moscow, by contrast, appears to believe that Thursday’s call was a triumph. It took place after the Pentagon [paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/us-weapons-freeze-dangerous-moment-ukraine-putin-steps-up-offensive-3783658?ico=in-line_link), citing depleted stockpiles within the well-worn US arsenal. The move horrified [Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/topic/ukraine?ico=in-line_link), but will have delighted the Russians who continue to note Trump’s oft-stated scepticism about the wisdom of Washington’s bottomless commitment to defending Kyiv.",2025-07-04T14:26:02
1lrk17o,Putin seems to view Trump as his personal plaything,theipaper,946,2025-07-04T14:25:49,theipaper,8,"Yuri Ushakov, a top Kremlin aide, said “Putin told Trump that [Russia ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia?ico=in-line_link)will not step back from its goals in Ukraine”. He insisted that Russia continued to seek “a negotiated solution” to the war, but only on Putin’s terms. “The President informed Trump that Russia will not give up on eliminating all the root causes of the confrontation that has arisen,” Ushakov continued, in time-honoured phrases that the Russians use to indicate they seek a surrender of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, and [Nato’s ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/nato?ico=in-line_link)withdrawal from positions it considers too close to Russia’s borders.

At times, Ushakov’s statement seemed designed deliberately to underscore the notion that Putin sees Trump as his own personal plaything. He claimed the two men discussed “promising joint economic projects”, including some in the areas of energy and space exploration. Having surrendered no ground over Ukraine, Putin then wished Trump a happy Independence Day, and noted the two men “can pick up the phone any time” and talk to one another again.",2025-07-04T14:26:12

For an American President who shocked the world last month by [striking at Iran’s nuclear facilities](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/everything-we-know-us-attack-on-iran-so-far-3763890?ico=in-line_link), [Trump’s supine approach towards Russia](https://inews.co.uk/news/trumps-long-standing-infatuation-with-putin-is-about-to-meet-its-ultimate-test-3666416?srsltid=AfmBOopfljeY8Qft2yBUA41-T3AZX_PVnCay_H4eG-Ob4JHa96dSLdKr&amp;ico=in-line_link) appears all the more extraordinary. The White House says the Pentagon is ready to take further military action to weaken [Iran’s ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/iran?ico=in-line_link)leadership if necessary, while the Kremlin is given an entirely free pass.

While some Republicans on Capitol Hill believe that Putin is the clear aggressor in the conflict and should be facing – at the very least – an additional raft of American sanctions, Trump has indicated that he plans to blunt their legislative initiative. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has softened a bill calling for 500 per cent US tariffs to be imposed on countries that purchase Russian oil. [Last weekend](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-asked-about-us-sanctions-bill-suggests-it-would-impact-ukraine-peace-2025-06-30/), after coming under fresh White House pressure, the Kremlin said backers of the proposed legislation should be careful not to damage peacekeeping efforts in the conflict.",2025-07-04T14:26:20

The relationship between the two leaders remains as enigmatic as ever, with Putin supremely confident that he can divert Trump’s attention with the promise of rich economic rewards for the US in the event that the war is resolved to Moscow’s satisfaction.

Trump doesn't *care* about how the war started, in Trump world, the powerful get what they want, and the less powerful do what the powerful want them to do!  

This is why Trump supports Putin in Ukraine and why he supports the EU in Ukraine after the EU leaders held an intervention during the pope's funeral.  If powerful Putin wants Ukraine then he'll join Putin and Ukraine needs to just roll over and die.  Wait a minute, powerful countries like France, Germany, etc all want Ukraine to win?  Then Ukraine deserves to win and he'll join the winning team!

Consensus is that if Russia is strong, it will invade Poland first then Lithuania. Otherwise, reverse the order. After these, either Finland or Latvia. The goal would be to get to Norway and Denmark where it would control the Baltic Sea. Once it controls this, no other countries could defend the rest of Europe because the Baltic Sea is crucial for the Navy. At this point, it will probably force most countries between the Baltic Sea and the Iran to sign an agreement giving up their sovereignty to Russia. Anyways, it will be as bad as Poland and Lithuania allow it to be. If they want sovereignty, they will push back as hard as Ukraine. Lithuania is incredible vulnerable because it is longer than it is wider and Putin just needs to get access to the Baltic Sea. That said, this is extremely easy to do for most large militaries because even if it's a meatgrinder, they will make it across. But the hard part is making it a battle every time they need to access the sea. On the other side of the Baltic is Norway. This invasion will happen via the arctic circle. I don't think any major war has been fought in the arctic circle, which has no solid land beneath, only ice and water. It will be much tough in Poland since they are a bigger country and very vocal about their opposition to Russia",2025-06-29T05:39:00

He makes it sound like Putin is trying to terminate an extended warranty policy early. 

What in Putin's behaviour, words or actions so far has given *any* indication that Putin wants to end his war? Or is it just another vibe, like how Trump just *felt* like Iran was building nukes despite US intelligence [saying otherwise](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-iran-attack-no-intel-nuclear-1235369641/)? 

Putin has it in his hands to end the war anytime he chooses. He can pull Russian troops back to where they were before February 2022, simple as that. Afterwards, we can discuss the reparations Russia will be liable for and how to best prosecute him for his war crimes. But if he only wants to stop the war, that can happen today.",2025-06-26T05:50:53

Vote in Congressional elections and encourage everyone you know to do the same. Between 70-80% of voters 40 and under **do not** vote in the midterms when the vast majority of Congress is elected. 

It's not rocket science as to why we aren't getting the most favorable policies. In contrast 75% of voters 65+ vote in the midterms. The reality is Americans resent voting. We want to cast a ballot once a decade for a populist candidate and not think about ""politics"" again. It's not *politics* -- it's a voice in our future and the ability to exercise your fundamental civil liberty. 

We keep repeating these scenarios of electing a Democratic president then immediately losing Congress. No bills are passed and voters complain ""nothing gets done"". 

That's how we got the Tea Party and the Freedom caucus. The public elected Obama by a landslide, but then didn't vote in Congress for the next 10 years. In 2018 we had the largest midterm voter participation rate because we were two years into Trumps first term. Defeated the so-called ""red wave"" and wiped the floor with the GOP.

We could have doing that the whole time!! **Elections are every two years.** Just show up and vote for the candidate you feel is most qualified. That's it. 

Not participating has a ruinous cascade effect. Oregon has mail in voting for 3 weeks up to Election day. Literally could not be easier. They had ranked choice voting on the ballot last election, and it lost due to low voter turnout. We are talking about the number 1 dream progressive legislation bill down the toilet *for nothing*. 

The people refuse to consistently vote. Especially non-GOP voters.  GOP voters show up every two years like clockwork. It's why they win elections. They don't care how long it takes or if there's a chance of winning. 

Redditors love to call them stupid, but how dumb can they be if they are winning elections and we aren't because we won't set aside a couple hours every two years to save democracy. Don't wait to be dazzled by a candidate -- just show up and fucking vote.",2025-06-17T23:49:21

When they say they do support some important principle, it's always either qualified as for X but not for Y, or espoused in bad faith. So you end up in a system where many of the representatives that are supposed to defend democracy work to undermine it, while their supporters approve or don't care as long as they are not the ones being targeted.

Fundamentally, the problem is that democracy is predicated on equality. If you don't at least see the value of an egalitarian society then you're not really going to support modern democracy, and remain at best stuck at the non-universal forms of democracy of the past, or at worst turn towards reactionary and authoritarian views. It's not ""our democracy"" but rather ""the democracy supported by some of us, while a lot of other people want to restrict or get rid of it even though they don't say that out loud"". When you see how easy it was for the supposed moderates to vote for an obvious fascist, extrapolate from that. Are they committed authoritarians? No. Are they committed to democracy? Neither.

Democracy can not survive if it only applies to certain political contexts, because then it can simply be avoided or sidelined by restricting its scope or changing the rules within it.

1. Indecisiveness: democracies are deliberate and slow, they struggle to react to quickly changing events. 

2. Procedural to a fault: democracies play a rule based game, they can’t handle people who just refuse to play by the rules. 

3. Friends and Enemies: democracies try to find consensus and middle ground, but if you view everything as Friends and Enemies you can destroy the middle ground. 

4. Legal Warfare: democracies usually have some sort of emergency powers for extreme situations. Exploit that and never let the emergency end. 

5. Pluralism is fragile: democracies tend to allow a lot of diverse groups and parties and thought. This creates disunity, and by offering Unity you can break democracy.

Same time, Republicans have several advantages between stacking the courts and gerrymandering that gives them a huge advantage when it comes to the elections. Despite being a minority when it comes to the popular vote, Republicans have more power in the Senate and courts-which is where enforcement would come from. There is almost no penalty for election fraud when you're also the group responsible for regulating it. And even if you do lose in court there is no enforcement of penalties for ignoring the court. E.g. being told in court to redraw unfair maps that disenfranchise voters and favor one party ... but instead just letting the clock run out so the State has to use your gerrymandered map has happened at least three times by Republicans. 

It's a situation where you're asking the foxes to regulate themselves already in the Hen house. The people perpetrating the election fraud are not going to enforce on themselves. The only people who did that for decades was Democrats and sometimes Republicans after the fact. Republicans love to jump in front of their own fraud with fake committees, investigate themselves, and find nothing while pointing at things that don't matter (voter fraud for example).

Everyone else is giving those, middle of the line bullshit that both parties are soft. When it's not remotely true.

But lately, it seems that Trump is having to come to terms with the reality that he's not equipped to negotiate anything resembling an end to this war. And after glorifying and defending Putin for years no less. Even now, Trump is desperately hoping for Putin's cooperation in return for pleading his case at the G7.

But because Trump now recognizes that brokering a peace will be far more complicated and difficult than he previously imagined, he's become frustrated over the fact that he won't be handed a ""win"" and entitled to some kind of accolade for his feckless efforts.

Make no mistake, Trump cares far more about being awarded for some half-baked attempt at a fleeting agreement than he does about actually ending the war.

That said, Trump promised to end the war on ""day one,"" but during his first call with Putin, they chatted about their ""shared history"" and discussed how Trump could help Putin realize his goals and assist Russia in seizing control of a large chunk of Ukrainian land.

Immediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a ""dictator""

Trump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies publicly denigrated Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership for weeks, and without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.

In fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.

Trump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to ""negotiate"" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.

Trump had the gall to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.

The truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.

Every ""deal"" he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.

He even previously called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius"" and ""savvy."" 

Trump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO. This move would weaken the alliance and strain our relationships with allies; effectively carrying out Putin's most ambitious goals for him.

Trump has practically enabled Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.

Trump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.

Trump has defended Putin for years, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a ""killer"" who murders his political opponents.

During his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over abandoned US military outposts.

Trump ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald ""bone spurs"" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed these forces to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.

And let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after he demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are crucial for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.

And look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been Putin's personal backscratcher and useful idiot for years, but what's really irritating right now is how Trump cares very little about the war and its ramifications, and is far more concerned about how he can take credit for negotiating a lukewarm deal at best.

He's desperate to be awarded the title of ""peacemaker,"" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, straining our alliances, and offering up Ukraine's territory to Russia with no real security guarantees in return.

He'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.

Putin is a dangerous expansionist on a warpath to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.

Trump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recover and reorganize his forces, only to return at some later time with another ""special military operation"" that's been repurposed and freshly equipped for its land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.

Putin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, not by Donald Trump at least, and as made evident by the fact that Putin has been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.

For Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as he can demand a Nobel Peace Prize for whatever iteration of a lazy, worthless, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",2025-06-16T22:32:06

""A ""two week"" deadline imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump to see if Russia is serious about peace in Ukraine has come and gone, with Moscow's escalation of attacks on civilians during this period failing to draw the slightest condemnation from the White House.


""We're going to find out very soon. It'll take about two weeks, or a week and a half,” Trump told reporters on May 28, responding to a question on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to end the war.


His comments came two days after Russia carried out the biggest drone attack of the full-scale war, which reportedly involved 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.


Since the deadline was imposed, this record has been broken twice — Russia attacked Ukraine overnight on June 1 with 472 Shahed-type attack drones, and on June 9, 479 drones and 20 missiles were launched against Ukrainian cities.""

I'm not suggesting we ban semicolons. I'm just making the perfectly logical and reasonable suggestion that semicolons are unhelpful in today's world, where people have so much more information available to them. In order to keep up with all of this they are therefore quickly scanning information and speed reading most of it.

If you want to connect with people who have that characteristic (and I would suggest that's the majority of today's readers) semicolons are really unhelpful because they do little to enhance readability.

One of the big problems with semicolons is that when people feel free to inflict them on their readers, they also tend to write much longer sentences.

Longer sentences require more effort and concentration from the reader. Modern readers, we know, are simply not good at that sort of thing.

Long sentences can also be a sign of lazy writing. Why? Because iit's easier and quicker to write longer text. It takes longer and needs a lot more thought and effort for us to keep things short and split our writing into shorter, more accessible sentences.",2025-06-16T14:32:58

Inherently the problem is communications via the internet (blogs, social media, published videos, etc.) encompass some form of speech. There are those who believe personal rights to speech extend to these platforms and services, while there are those who believe what flies and doesn't is entirely at the discretion of the owner/operator of said platforms/services. So save for a few generally universally agreed upon ills such as violence and sexual exploitation, the platform operators and government are at odds on where the line resides.

There's also the problem of how rapidly the public internet can spread information in general. If we presumed no bad faith or ulterior motives, there is still a significant possibility that for every person who passes information along, what gets relayed to the next person (or their localized audience) will be modified in a way that changes the original information. There is no reliable and direct method that is not time and effort intensive to accurately trace the genealogy of any story put out on the internet (which also a reason why some of the most beloved creepypastas have endured - they were relatively plausible albeit entirely fictitious). And that's going to get *even harder* with the advent of relatively easy to use generative AI tools to edit videos and images. Bad actors know the average person isn't going to bother really researching things as long as it looks real enough.

But bot farms, specifically. That's truly whack-a-mole. Even if a domain or site is determined to be acting in bad faith or a harmful (let's say not outright illegal) way, the best you can do is choose to not engage with/block content from that site or report it to their hosting provider. In the case of the latter, they may choose to do nothing unless there's a significant number of complaints. I have firsthand experience with this - my company had its corporate site cloned and then used in an imposter site that was scamming people using our name and branding/logos. It took several complaints and presentation of evidence that the masquerading site was illegitimate before it was taken down. Even if a bot farm does get whammied as illegal, it gets shut down through seizure by the FBI or terminated by the hosting provider. So what happens then? They just shift over elsewhere and start up again.

I do appreciate the outlook of wanting to push back against the tide, though. There's actually a documentary on HBO Max mainly about Russian interference that has a fairly lengthy section about the bot farms. iirc it's called Agents of Chaos.",2025-06-15T00:55:09

"", may have something to say. However, he says he has respect for the office and yada yada yada and wouldn't say anything to the public. Now,  emailed this man and his office asking for this information and have not received response. But I think it is incumbent upon every American who is an actual American in good faith and of good conscience to do the same. 

This was a real comment. You can see it at least on MSNBC regardless of what any bad faith media disinfosphere people may try to tell you. I believe we now need to know and if it can't be told in public at least needs to be pressed upon.

My guess, is that it has everything to do with Russia Russia Russia. Because otherwise why the hell else back in 2016 would have we started hearing all of this about Russia Russia Russia. It's Sun Tzu, The Art of War, and no, the people that realize this are not crazy, drunk, senile, or demented. 

Contact Governor Gavin Newsom and ask him what it would be that would send shivers down our spine. I, for one, believe it is our right to know, now especially since Senators have been assassinated.",2025-06-15T03:37:42

&gt;Trump is clearly getting frustrated with Putin,

No he is being frustrated in his intentions *by Zelensky* who has shown he will not respond to threats or bribes into betraying his country. There's no payday unless Trump delivers. The vocal concern for the death toll is pure fabrication. Trump does not understand and cannot feel compassion. He's a narcissist. He's manipulating the discussion to make Zelensky the bad boy so he can push for a replacement that is more compliant. 

&gt;The US really does have the necessary tools to shift the balance and put Russia in an impossible position, where stepping down becomes the best option for Putin.

Putin is finished if he loses this war. There's no stepping down, no ""Golden Bridge"" to a pleasant retirement in a dacha in the countryside. It's an open 7th floor window, a polonium tea party, or an exploding helicopter ride the moment it happens. He made a huge mistake. He knows it and as long as he's breathing, and wants to continue doing so, the war goes on.

Russia is undoubtedly in trouble. War costs money. Russia's economy is about the size of Italy's. Compared to the US, and the EU which has an economy about the same as the US, it is a minnow in a sea of sharks. It is 3 1/2 years into a 3 day war Putin stupidly started and is nowhere near winning. Almost 50% of all its government expenditure is going towards the war. Interest rates have been raised to 29% and banks have been forced to give the government loans. Which it has to pay extortionate interest rates on. Inflation is soaring. It is reduced to begging help from North Korea, Iran and China. 1 million of its soldiers are either dead, missing, or wounded. At that level of loss the risk of revolt is a very real possibility, especially if they start drawing from the youth of Moscow and St Petersburg, hence they're bussing in replacements from North Korea. Experts say it can't go on and that Russia is close to buckling. This is the year it ends, they say, and if pressure is maintained and support for Ukraine continues it will end with Russia losing and Putin's destructive reign over.

While Russia is burning through Rubles, and its young men, at a frightening rate, US support for Ukraine has been just over 1% of just its military budget and that's from mostly mothballed stock that's cheaper to give away than dispose of. Money that is spent, is spent in the US replenishing stocks.  It seems a no brainer to bring down America's greatest adversary so decisively for so little cost, and at no loss of American lives, and a grateful Ukraine ready to grant Trump all the mineral licences he wants and probably that Nobel prize nomination he craves so much.

The West holds the cards and by association, assuming support continues, so does Ukraine. Putin holds none, bar the nuclear one, which he can't use, except as a sabre to rattle. He knows this, and so does Trump, or he should know it. So it is puzzling why he doesn't jump at the chance of kneecapping an enemy that historically hates the US and has been working to destroy it for 8 decades. Instead of quickly ending this by increasing sanctions and increasing aid to Ukraine so they can finish the job, he's maneuvering to give Putin, the enemy, everything he wants, and Ukraine, the ally, nothing. One could be forgiven for wondering whose interests is Trump representing in these ""peace"" talks? Ukraine's, Putin's, or his own?

The war's end is there for the taking. Why doesn't Trump take it?",2025-06-10T15:55:57
1l80pqs,Putin's days are numbered - and Trump could pull the trigger,theipaper,0,2025-06-10T14:50:48,theipaper,0,"I suspect neither of these is wholly true. Everything we have seen of Trump since his return to office suggests he is fixated only on bolstering his own image. He seems to have an obsession with delivering on the big-ticket promises he made before returning to the White House. One of those promises was to end the war in Ukraine. The biggest block to achieving that is, Trump seems to now understand, one Vladimir Putin. Between not turning up to his own peace talks and firing ballistic missiles at civilians, Trump seems to have finally realised that Putin isn’t someone he can work with to reach a lasting peace.

At this stage, I personally don’t care [what Trump’s motives are.](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-says-putin-has-gone-absolutely-crazy-and-warns-of-russias-downfall-3714101?ico=in-line_link) Some say he desperately wants a Nobel Peace Prize. If he manages to end the war in a way that doesn’t mean Ukraine’s subjugation, fine, give him two. But true victory for Ukraine must mean a clear path to the end of Putinism.

I genuinely believe that the conditions and means exist for this to happen in the next 12 months.

Trump is clearly getting frustrated with Putin, and Ukraine’s recent ability to [strike deep within Russian territory adds an extra level of peril ](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-russia-drone-attack-nuclear-response-3726514?ico=in-line_link)for Russian citizens, also suffering war fatigue.

For now, at least, Trump is not leveraging America’s strength in a way that exposes Putin’s weakness. The US could lift sanctions to make life easier for Russia; or it could impose greater economic hardship on the country. It could also make a firm commitment to support Ukraine militarily in a way that would make Putin’s position as a wartime leader untenable.

Trump surely knows that if he is brave enough to use all of the economic and military tools at his disposal, he is the only international figure who could credibly threaten Russia to the extent that he can also offer Putin an off ramp – ultimately seeing the Russian President leave office so someone else can take charge. In short: Putin’s strength as a leader is contingent on Trump’s continued refusal to fully use America’s might.

The US really does have the necessary tools to shift the balance and put Russia in an impossible position, where stepping down becomes the best option for Putin. The only remaining question is: does he have the cojones to stand up to Putin? The whole world – and especially Ukraine – would be grateful.

1l4r329,Ukraine’s spectacular drone strikes rattled Trump and Putin,theipaper,144,2025-06-06T12:25:01,theipaper,11,"Ukraine’s [bold attacks targeting key assets](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russian-strikes-on-kyiv-kill-four-days-after-moscow-vowed-to-retaliate-3733963?ico=in-line_link) in Moscow’s war effort have struck a nerve with Russia – which launched another deadly missile and drone attack overnight.

Bombs hit Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, killing four people and wounding 20, authorities said. But Ukraine fired back – hitting a [Russian](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia?ico=in-line_link) fuel depot situated near to a strategic bomber airbase.

In pictures across social media, the Engels oil refinery, based in the Saratov Oblast in the west of the country was engulfed in flames.

It comes after Kyiv carried out a large underwater explosion aimed at the crucial road and rail bridge linking the Russian-held Crimean peninsula to mainland Russia on Tuesday, causing damage to its underwater foundations.

This followed the audacious “Operation Spider’s Web” drone attacks on Moscow’s strategic bomber fleet over the weekend that saw a number of Vladimir Putin’s aircraft wiped out. Ukraine claims that it targeted 41 strategic bombers in the operation, adding that “at least” 13 were destroyed. Security officials say the shock incursion took 18 months to plan and saw many drones smuggled into Russia.

Videos of the explosions that flooded social media were striking and Kyiv’s degrading of Russia’s war machine sends a message that is hard to overlook. But experts still aren’t convinced the attacks will shift the balance of the war in a substantial way.

“There’s always been this sort of underestimation of the Ukrainians. And each time the Ukrainians do this, it makes the Russians sit up and think again,” said John Foreman, associate fellow at Chatham House and former UK defence attaché to Moscow and Kyiv.",2025-06-06T12:25:12
1l4r329,Ukraine’s spectacular drone strikes rattled Trump and Putin,theipaper,144,2025-06-06T12:25:01,theipaper,9,"“But will it translate into progress at the peace table? I’m not sure, because ultimately Russia wants Ukraine to surrender, it doesn’t want to parley with it.”

# Time to move ahead with sanctions 

The timing of the attacks, which occurred around direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul on Monday, was no coincidence but an effort to underscore that Ukraine won’t agree to unfavourable terms, Foreman pointed out.

“I think Ukraine was signalling to Russia its determination to fight on. I think it was signalling that Ukraine has cards to play, that it’s not just going to sit there and be the recipient of Russian aggression,” he said.

“Russia’s going to get back some of its own, what it’s trying to inflict onto Ukrainians. And Ukraine won’t roll over at the negotiating table. So I don’t think the timing was accidental.”

Beyond their impact on Russia’s military capabilities, the Ukrainian attacks also serve as a reminder to the Russian people that the war is still ongoing—and that its consequences can be felt at home as well, he said.

At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin may leverage the attacks to influence Donald Trump’s decision-making, asserting that Kyiv cannot be trusted and that President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government is illegitimate, Forman said.

“His reaction, I think, will be more to try and convince Americans, Trump in particular, that Ukrainians are an obstacle to peace, not Russia,” he said. “But of course, what he’s forgetting is that he, Putin, has been the one who launched the legal war. It’s him who’s been committing war crimes against Ukrainian civilians by his troops.”

The attacks also add another layer of pressure on the US President, who has been hesitant to impose swift new sanctions and other financial measures on Moscow, arguing that they would hinder negotiations.

“The approach they’ve taken by offering carrots to Russia and not using sticks like sanctions has failed. So I think there’s a very large chance, a very high chance, that Trump will try and walk away,” Forman said.",2025-06-06T12:25:26
1l4r329,Ukraine’s spectacular drone strikes rattled Trump and Putin,theipaper,144,2025-06-06T12:25:01,theipaper,3,"However, former US Ambassador to Nato and former special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, believes that Trump still wants to demonstrate he can reach a deal and may soon seek Congress’s approval of the measures, which he could then use to pressure Putin into agreeing to a ceasefire.

“I think President Trump has deliberately held back because he is trying to pull Putin in. He wants Putin to agree to a ceasefire and then a settlement,” he said. But Putin is “playing games” with the negotiations, he is reading Trump’s position as “weak,” wants to continue fighting, and therefore, “it’s time to move ahead” with sanctions, Volker said.

By applying continuing military and economic pressure on Moscow, the US, Ukraine and European allies would strain Russia’s resources, weaken its position, “and just have to hope that sooner rather than later Putin will come to the conclusion that he has to end the war.”

# Trump doesn’t see Ukraine as critical for US security  

The approach of the current US administration differs significantly from that of former President Joe Biden’s administration, as Trump and his cabinet are “much more focused on China and the Asia-Pacific” and view Russia as a declining power.

“My major concern is that this administration fundamentally doesn’t care about Ukraine in the same way as perhaps Biden did,” he said. “They see Ukraine as a non-critical matter for US security” and they think the Europeans as well as Canada should be doing more about their security.

“So I think ultimately, without the Americans fully engaged, bringing all levers of American power to bear, the scenario is that the war will continue.”

In the months ahead, we likely won’t see “a dramatic breakthrough by one side or the other,” Foreman said.",2025-06-06T12:25:33
1l4r329,Ukraine’s spectacular drone strikes rattled Trump and Putin,theipaper,144,2025-06-06T12:25:01,theipaper,4,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov echoed this view on Tuesday, telling reporters that “it would be wrong to expect immediate solutions and breakthroughs.”

He also dismissed the prospect of a summit between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the US.

“In the near future, it is unlikely,” he told reporters, adding that such a summit could only take place after Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reach an agreement.

The two sides remain far apart.

“I think Ukraine will remain on the back foot and Russia will carry on pressing forward” — on the battlefield and in its efforts to distance the US from Europe, said Foreman.

“You have to have credible tools. You have to use them, otherwise Russia won’t pay attention,” he noted.

“They can see Trump’s inherent weakness and reluctance to do anything towards Russia. And they’re playing him along.”",2025-06-06T12:25:40

Notice that trump didn't mention anything about telling putin not to respond to Ukraine's attack. All he does is pass along putin's message, even saying that putin ""has to"" respond, even though it's a choice. putin chose to start this war, and every day, he chooses to continue it. But trump doesn't recognize him as the aggressor, because **he's on putin's side.**

Also notice that trump made sure to describe putin's warning as ""very strong."" He's giving putin credibility!

Reminder: trump recently admitted that he's been protecting russia. [https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1kwr2ts/52725\_putin\_is\_playing\_with\_fire\_because\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/trumptweets/comments/1kwr2ts/52725_putin_is_playing_with_fire_because_without/)

But I don’t want to tell you what it is because then I can’t use that negotiation; it’ll never work,” Trump told Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, claiming that he could “solve” the war “in 24 hours” if he were back in the White House.

“But it’s a very easy negotiation to take place. I will have it solved within one day, a peace between them,” Trump said of the war, which at that point had been ongoing for more than a year since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

MAY 2023: “They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done — I’ll have that done in 24 hours,” Trump said during a town hall on CNN.

AUGUST 2024: “Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump told a National Guard Conference. “I’ll get it settled very fast. I don’t want you guys going over there. I don’t want you going over there.”

SEPTEMBER 2024"" “That is a war that’s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president,” the Republican said during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday. If I win, when I’m president-elect and what I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other, I’ll get them together.”

“I know Zelenskyy very well and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship and they respect your president, O.K., they respect me, they don’t respect Biden.”

&gt;The outlines of a likely deal are clear enough. Russia would keep territory that it controls in Ukraine’s east and south, including the Crimean Peninsula. It would also receive promises from the West to lift economic sanctions and not to admit Ukraine to NATO. For Ukraine, the West could commit to military and economic support if Russia attacks again and, more immediately, to integrate Ukraine even more closely into the European economy. 

This is so messed up. russia doesn't deserve any concessions. How does it make sense to let russia keep Ukraine's stolen territory AND lift sanctions?? So they're keeping what they stole and the ""consequences"" are that they get a reward of sanctions relief... wtf?! And on top of that, Ukraine isn't allowed to join NATO because... why exactly? Why does russia get to decide what alliances Ukraine is allowed to join? Does Ukraine have a similar power over russia? Of course not. It's just one-sided.

Also, ""the West could commit to military and economic support if Russia attacks again"" doesn't make sense either. What does this mean, exactly? What would the West commit to doing that is not already being done now, and why isn't that being done now? This whole thing about ""if russia attacks again"" is BS, because russia keeps attacking and attacking right now. Why must russia attack ""again"" in order to trigger some kind of bigger response from the West?

I just don't understand why people don't realize that **russia is eventually going to try to take all of Ukraine -- and beyond that -- unless it is stopped by force.** So russia either needs to be stopped by force now within Ukraine, or in the future after taking all of Ukraine. Which will it be?",2025-05-29T16:56:35

**""Donald Trump set off another** social media eruption on Tuesday when he [posted](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114580564427808609) on his money-losing Truth Social site, “What Valdimir Putin doesn’t realize is that if it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He’s playing with fire!” Here apparently was evidence from the horse’s mouth that Trump has long been playing nice with and protecting the tyrannical Russian leader and war criminal. There were, of course, no details.""

""Did these messages signal some sort of pivot for Trump? Who knows with him? Trump could just as easily in the middle of the night zap out a post inviting Putin to his big, beautiful upcoming military parade in Washington, DC. But these posts have returned to the spotlight the curious relationship between Trump and Putin, and any such assessment has to include a fundamental fact that has been memory-holed and generally absent from the national political conversation: Trump initially won the presidency partly because Putin covertly attacked the 2016 election.""

""Since he returned to the Oval Office, Trump has generally acted in sync with his longstanding affinity for Putin. He badgered and threatened Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, blaming him for the Russia-Ukraine war that was launched by Putin, and repeatedly expressed sympathy and support for Putin, even as Russian forces bombed civilian targets and continued [kidnapping](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/fact-sheet-russias-kidnapping-and-re-education-of-ukraines-children/) thousands of Ukrainian children. It seemed rather obvious that Trump wanted the war to end not because he was outraged by Putin’s vicious and vile assault on democracy and decency but so he would be free to work with the Russian autocrat for whom he has expressed admiration for over a decade.""

""In 2013, when Trump announced he would be staging his Miss Universe contest in Moscow—a venture that would earn him several million dollars thanks to the event being underwritten by a Putin-friendly oligarch—he asked, via a [tweet](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E347191326112112640%7Ctwgr%5Eb1b2e8f1ba4e986ee37c298dee23fa2466b4ab2c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics-news%2Fdonald-trumps-tweet-best-friend-939986%2F), if Putin, who at that point was ratcheting up his repressive ways, would “become my new best friend?” When he was in Moscow for the pageant, Trump, who had long chased deals in Russia (and who had attracted Russian money for his various business projects), was [obsessed with meeting with Putin](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/russian-connection-what-happened-moscow-inside-story-trump-obsession-putin-david-corn-michael-isikoff/). No tete-a-tete transpired. In subsequent years, he often hailed the Russian (“strong,” “smart”), and he periodically sought to develop a Trump tower in Moscow—a project he secretly pursued while running for president in 2016. (His personal attorney, Michael Cohen, even sought assistance from Putin’s office for the deal, which eventually fizzled.)""

""For nine years, Trump has done a masterful job of suppressing what was perhaps the most important story of the 2016 race: Moscow attacked the US election to assist Trump, and Trump and his crew aided and abetted that assault by denying it was happening. With his relentless ranting about “Russia, Russia, Russia,” the “Russia hoax,” and the “witch hunt”—propaganda enthusiastically embraced and loudly amplified by right-wing media and GOP leaders—Trump has essentially erased from public discourse Putin’s successful subversion of an US election and Trump’s own traitorous complicity.""

""As Trump seeks to implement autocratic and corrupt rule in the United States, his dealings with Putin are likely to be complex and, perhaps, erratic. He hates Zelenskyy. He admires Putin. He wants the war to go away. He foolishly promised he could make that happen in 24 hours. He doesn’t know what to do, and Putin, still aiming to crush a democratic Ukraine, is not helping. The known history between the two—and there could be important aspects that are unknown—is complicated and still puzzling. But as pundits, politicians, and voters assess how Trump is faring with all this, they ought to keep foremost in mind that he’s sitting in the White House partly because of Putin’s skullduggery. That’s the original sin of the Trump presidencies, and many in Ukraine and America are bearing its consequences.""",2025-05-29T14:49:16
1kyco7a,Trump Can’t Escape the Original Sin of His Presidency: His Bond with Putin,ChiGuy6124,559,2025-05-29T14:47:07,PsychLegalMind,3,"Trump certainly demonstrated closeness to Putin during his first run and he was very close to Bibi too. This time around he promised to bring peace both in the Middle East and an end to Ukraine war. Initially, he took steps to bring an end to the Ukraine crisis by primarily targeting Zelensky and threatening him to reach a peace deal with Putin.

Thus far it has not gone anywhere except that U.S. is talking to both sides directly and Trump is now publicly questioning Putin's sincerity and threatening devastating secondary sanctions against Russia. It has brought some relief to Ukraine and talks are expected yo continue, but peace is not on the horizon either in Ukraine nor in the Middle East.  

Only one thing is certain, Trump's bond or enmity with friends and foes tend to inconsistent and rarely long lasting. Whether he can accomplish any peace in either Ukraine or in the Middle East remains in doubt because he is not the only player on the world stage. There are others, EU, Russia and China and the larger Middle East itself.",2025-05-29T15:09:25

My take is Putin embarrassed Trump in a vulnerable moment, (because we know he has the fragile ego of a teen age boy), by continuing bombing after their supposed beautiful phone call.

He's very good at securing results for *himself*, personally. Squeezing contractors, ducking creditors, and manipulating the media to generate useful coverage for himself - not to mention using the office of the president for personal enrichment. As far as being a negotiator on behalf of the United States (ie. the actual job of a president) it would never occur to Trump to value that outcome, especially if it interfered with his own benefit.

It's not that Trump tries to get good deals for America and fails, it's that it would literally never cross his mind to even try achieving that. This is why I'm sure he won't ultimately do anything to harm Putin: there's too much mutually-beneficial dealmaking at stake to risk rocking that boat.

When desperate and stupid people fall in line with obviously damaged and possibly psychotic criminals posing as leaders and follow them in to acts of cruelty and destruction.. uncivil acts.

Neither MAD player wants to fold a hand, but the last thing that either player wants is to have their bluff called.

The problem with egotists at the table is that they will over-bluff, or in other words make a bluff that is verifiably false.  The other player will have to call that bluff, because if the over-bluffing player was lying at that point, then it calls into question everything previously claimed.

That then brings us to the secondary problem of egotists playing MAD Poker.  They cannot accept losing even one hand in the game... So when they are called on their ridiculous bluff, instead of folding they will show their cards, in the hopes that they win, and then millions die.

This has been played out hundreds of times in war game simulations.  Ego driven players cause apocalyptic wars.",2025-05-28T13:06:31

1kwz9yn,Russian bots turn on ‘clown’ Donald Trump after he rips Putin over war in Ukraine,theindependentonline,266,2025-05-27T21:22:52,Choice-of-SteinsGate,15,"Trump is having to come to terms with reality after glorifying and defending Putin for years; desperately hoping for his cooperation in return.

But because Trump now recognizes that brokering a peace will be far more complicated and difficult than he previously imagined, he's become outraged over the fact that he won't be handed a ""win"" and entitled to some kind of accolade for his feckless efforts.

Make no mistake, Trump cares far more about being awarded for his efforts than he does about actually ending the war.

That said, Trump promised to end the war on ""day one,"" but during his first call with Putin, they chatted about their ""shared history"" and discussed how Trump could help Putin realize his goals and assist Russia in seizing control of a large chunk of Ukrainian land.

Immediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a ""dictator""

Trump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies publicly denigrated Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership for weeks, and without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.

In fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.

Trump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to ""negotiate"" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.

Trump had the gall to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.

The truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.

Every ""deal"" he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.

He even previously called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius"" and ""savvy."" 

Trump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO. This move would only weaken the alliance; effectively carrying out one of Putin's most ambitious goals for him.

Trump has practically enabled Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.

Trump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.

Trump has defended Putin for years, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a ""killer"" who murders his political opponents.

During his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over abandoned US military outposts.

Trump ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald ""bone spurs"" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed these forces to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.

And let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after he demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are crucial for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.

And look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been Putin's personal backscratcher and useful idiot for years, but what's really irritating right now is how Trump cares very little about the war and its ramifications, and is far more concerned about how he can take credit for negotiating a lukewarm deal at best.

He's desperate to be awarded the title of ""peacemaker,"" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, straining our alliances, and offering up Ukraine's territory to Russia with no real security guarantees in return.

He'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.

Putin is a dangerous expansionist on a warpath to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.

Trump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, only to later resume a freshly organized and newly equipped ""special military operation"" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.

Putin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.

For Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, half-hearted and temporary deal is made.",2025-05-27T21:50:57

Now that Putin has pretty much destroyed his lucrative energy monopoly with Europe he only has one thing on his mind, petty revenge as he regards Ukraine as the ‘cause’ of all his problems because they refused to capitulate and the knowledge that after the war, investment will flood into Ukraine not only to rebuild, but to strengthen and entichen Ukraine beyond his wildest nightmare.

How did UK stop being the prominent leader of Europe/West? They refused to back France's desire to assert the Treaty of Versailles when Germany re-armed the Rhineland. They did nothing when Germany annexed Austria. They exclaimed ""peace in our time!"" when they signed the peace agreement to give Germany the Sudetenland after Hitler cried about the persecution of Germans, which then broke the treaty to annex Czechia.

Which obviously led to WW2 &amp; the birth of America's role as the leader of the West.

//
...
Sunday evening’s rant was aimed squarely at Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite what he called a “very good relationship” with Putin, Trump in his latest statement on the Ukraine-Russia war blasted the Russian leader as “absolutely crazy.”

“He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!” Trump warned.

Later:

*Loath as he is to give Zelensky any credit for correctly predicting that Russia’s leadership had no real intentions of ending the war, Trump’s emotional outburst comes as he seems to be realizing that the issue could become a major blemish on the “dealmaker” perception he has sought to cultivate.*

Russia is the 4th biggest arms exporter in the World, given its been involved in this conflict for the past 3 years, it gives you the idea they have all they want &amp; excess to export.

The sanctions have made no difference whatsoever &amp; are window dressing paid for by European tax payers.

The Russian economy is growing at 4.1% EU at 1.7%.&amp; yes all domestically developed tech.

The benefit of a war is the constant ability to test &amp; develop.  Russian drones &amp; in fact Ukrainian ones are well ahead of the US.

The hypersonic missiles are impossible to defend against they hit their targets at Mach 3.

Glide bombs, fibre optical drones, surface to air defence systems &amp; now the ability to deploy strategies to  defeat  tne much vaunted US  Patriot missile systems, all Russian tech &amp; development.

This conflict has created or recreated a new military super power, well done all round.

Lyndsay Graham was just saying isn't it great they've been able to give Ukraine all their stock in return for the money tax payers gave Ukraine to give back to Raytheon,Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman etc

People said Russia was a superpower prior to the invasion and claimed it would be a 3-4 day operation to take Kyiv. So is this where the propaganda has shifted, they weren't a superpower prior to the invasion but after years of this war dragging on, they definitely are now?

Also, it's interesting how you skipped over the negative developments for Russia since the invasion, like the expansion of NATO. I've seen NATO expansion suggested as a justification for this war, yet it prompted Sweden and Finland to join. In the case of Finland, there's a few hundred extra miles of NATO right at Russia's border now. Oops.",2025-05-28T00:56:17

There's some good info around on why Russia thought a light incursion into Ukraine would work, more about backing them off than capturing Ukraine, it was 15 000 troops incl reserves?

There s 800, 000 on the boarders now.

The history pre incursion is illuminating particularly US involvement.

Rand wrote a strategy paper in 2019 proposing destabilising Russia by using Ukraine as a proxy, it also included Israel as a vehicle against Iran &amp; Taiwan against China.

These things aren't random 

The corporations had a field day in Russia between 1992 &amp; 1999, they were hoping for a re run without Putin. 

Now this is not to say Putin is a choir boy, but it's no secret the US has a long history of destabilising country's in the name of freedom, democracy &amp; liberty.

This generally leaves 1000s X10  dead, the country destroyed &amp; a dividend for US institutional shareholders. 

This all gets rinsed through western media to oil the wheels &amp; develop the narrative.

On Friday Ukraine fired over a 1000 drones at Moscow, primarily the airport, remember these are CIA targeting officers, Biden authorised as part of the Ukrainian support package, by mistake or intentionally they came close to Putins helicopter transporting him to Kursk.

2 days later Russia targets Kiev with a massive drone &amp; missile attack. Trump says Putins gone nuts.

As though he knows nothing about it.

The info is all publicly available but you won't read about the Moscow attack on msm, WH briefings or Reddit.

I  did wonder if someone had actually told Trump.

My guess Russia will own the 4 oblasts by the end of summer &amp; with the €1 trillion the EU has to launder for the usual suspects, it will drag on for another couple of years, the more they antagonise Putin, the more of Ukraine he will capture, so I'd pencil in Odessa for next year, built by Catherine the Great &amp; 100 % Russian speaking, the mayor recently told the recruiting thugs from Kiev to piss off or they'd be arrested.",2025-05-28T01:41:23

We have a whole generation that grew up on stereotypes about “stupid Americans”, “stupid Europeans” - it's not achievements like “Russia is leading in science/manufacturing”, it's more like jokes, comedians, anecdotes, our own movies that make Russians look the best and others look stupid or evil (like Hollywood movies of the 80s with stereotypical Russian villains, only in reverse). These are also years of superiority propaganda: WE won in WW2, WE defended Europe, WE stopped Hitler's army, etc. 

Last years (2015-now) this propaganda became stronger, and together with sanctions, language barrier, low income of half of the population (we can't go to Europe, we are too poor to travel, lol) people form a certain picture of the world, which is hard to change even if you leave Russia, because then you have to admit the fallacy of your views and beliefs. And it's hard to admit your own mistakes. Therefore, such people feed their own delusions.

In fairness to Russia, their involvement in WW2 was actually incredibly decisive in the outcome of the war and they sacrificed huge numbers of troops to ensure that outcome.

Fundamentally, most of them don’t understand what the word “politics” means.  Or what the concept entails.

About Prigozhin - that's water under the bridge for a long time. Putin successfully got rid of him pretty fast and is no weaker because of that now than he was before.

And no, the war is not an ego thing for Putin. It's an imperialist thing - he wants to restore the empire. He also needs wars to constantly whip up nationalist sentiment at home with ""mother Russia is in danger"" rhetoric. The wars are a cornerstone of his power. It's not the first war he has waged for those purposes.

So he plays a long and pretty well-calculated geopolitical game and so far he has not lost it.

The phrase “Sic semper tyrannis”, which translates to “Thus always to tyrants” or more liberally as “This is what happens to tyrants”, is a powerful and enduring motto with a long history of association with the rejection of tyranny and authoritarianism.

The phrase has been used in both historical and modern contexts to symbolize resistance against oppressive rulers and has become a rallying cry for those who seek freedom and justice.

We lost 6 months in Ukraine like terrible months. And our defence industry did a trillion in revenue last year for the first time, this year they've lost 40% market cap. 

We were making 3-5x returns on this, and we could be making a lot more if we actually taxed companies you know?  If we had just an average corporate tax rate that would be 300 billion for taxpayers, every year.

And this was not simply linear growth, because we had all the cash in lendlease while everyone donatee Soviet surplus and buying new stuff from us, but he somehow managed to ruin 8 years of backdated procurement orders. Worth trillions. Like ten trillion. For real. We had the most orders for current gen fighters and patriots systems and ammo and electronic warfare infrastructure etc on the books through 2035 then we have ever had. Our very bad industry which also employs a lot of people was going to double. 

When trump was like arguing with macron about oh we sent x amount of money and he's like yeah we did too, and trump didn't believe him.  Yes, Europe did send more than us except we only sent military aid and a big portion of that was lendlease. They sent financial aid and food and stuff. Because 'military aid' is the up up down down left right left right select start cheat code that allows this incomprehensible bag of jelly of a country to keep oozing forward.

None of this is counting the incredible amount of lng we were exporting, and all of the new  jobs and infrastructure we got processing the stuff and  building them lng ports. Now if we could tax this better or owned at least some of it it could pay for everything we would ever need forever, put every kid in college get everybody health care. But it sure as hell doubled our exports and decoupled our allies from our adversary. 

If you claim that you want to build manufacturing and make America safe, I'm not clear how destroying the defense industry plays into that. We are the best at making things that kill people, presumably this is good for our security. One assumes, I'm not a doctor or anything, but if my leg fell off I'd probably figure out where I should go. 

 There is nothing pleasant about this infinite money glitch Biden was running.   But failing to understand that America it's getting $3-5 out for every dollar in, this infantile idea of 'losing money' is such a ridiculous reason to collapse. He really thought the president of China and Russia respected him that's how absolutely pathetic he is. 

I know the empire will fall but can we do it like with some fkn dignity?  Can we fall at least keeping like at least three of our promises. So many Ukrainians died and fought because we said we would support them until the end. It's a disgrace. The only thing we have that was even marginally defensible was that we were giving them hope and a way to fight. Pulling this away after half a million of them died is like the worst thing. Another century defining horror losing the only silver lining is that we were legitimately helping. 

Gaza is a century defining injustice with no silver lining and most of that is on Biden still, but it's starting to add up for Trump. What trump did did the kurds was unjustifiable. Giving all those venezuelan's blanket TPS status to get a good photo op of owning madura and then deporting all of them his first day of back in office. Everything he does is either evil or stupid.  We have like 87 horrific things and three okay things and one good thing so like can we please collapse with those three good things still being there please. 

I wanna go down with like some morals. What was the point of the 300 if we simply collapse because we elected an infant who thinks a world leader jingling keys in his face means they respect him.",2025-05-27T05:21:40

The definition of a tantrum is as follows: an uncontrollable outburst of anger and frustration, typically in a young child.

But I have the knack for it and I have studied it.  
   
Intelligence is a term up for debate now more than ever, as we find out more animals are more intelligent than we previously thought, just in different ways. But it all boils down to using the resources available to you in creative ways to achieve as good results as possible. Or at lest do your best to try. Choosing to use your resources to cause deliberate harm and not achieve the best outcome if you used those resources in other ways is not what I'd call intelligent. It is cunning. Being sly and calculating for nefarious goals.  
   
For the sake of argument - yes, Putin is smarter than Trump. But that'd be similar as saying a crow is smarter than a snake. Sure, those two individuals are intelligent, when compared to most animals. But when compared to humans with more knowledge and far-sightedness, these two are only cunning. Meaning, you could say they are intelligent in manipulation, doing evil shit and serving no-one but themselves. Cunning.  
   
Humans have enough intelligence to look at benefits longer-term and wider scope than what a crow does with a stick or rocks to keep it fed for the time being. And when humans do as the crow does... well, that's a stark reminder that we are still animals and not THAT much better than other animals, since we're prone to those same instinctual mechanisms, although we should have the capacity to shackle them and use our theoretically superior brain to cause as much benefit to as many as possible.  
   
Sadly, it is exactly cunning that tends to land people in positions of power, because those with intelligence usually do not want to harm others to get their way.  
   
For simplicity's sake let's just say I call ""intelligent"" someone who is both smart and emotionally mature. And ""cunning"" someone who is smart but emotionally corrupt. And it takes a certain degree of intelligence to not be morally corrupt - to decide you want to be a good person and multiply happiness.",2025-05-27T05:22:37

He has no courage. And he has never fought for anything himself a day in his life. Make no mistake people. If you don’t see his words as arbitrary then you’re going to continue to be surprised by basically everything that he says and does. It’s all divisive politics.

I accuse you of propaganda because that's what you are doing, so called ""what-about-ism"" referes to bringing up unrelated bad things, therein saying ""but what about this"" instead of responding to what's actually being talked about. 

The original comment accused MAGA republicans in the US of prolonging the war in Ukraine, which they verifiably did by delaying or outright blocking aid packages in Congress for as long as they could; however you failed to grasp this, simply saying ""Biden was President"", completely ignoring the point being made. 

You can continue listing all the terrible things the US did all you want, but fact of the matter is that Republicans in the US absolutely withheld aid to Ukraine in tern prolonging the war (not saying it would have ended if they didn't but you can't argue that withholding it didn't prolonge the conflict.) 

Further you say people need to be sold a tale of democracy and freedom, yet you fail to answer how Russia invading Ukraine, which to reiterate is a sovereign and democratic nation, is anything but straight up imperialism. Ontop of which comes all the suffering of Ukrainians endured as a result of that completely unjustified invasion.

In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump[ said his Russian counterpart had “gone absolutely CRAZY”](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-calls-putin-vance-russia-doesnt-know-how-to-end-war-3701711?srsltid=AfmBOoowXMMw55Nqonr5dgg1tGjUJmdV_w6gPI-Y7LhFy0UF6N8yMy5S&amp;ico=in-line_link) in launching a deadly wave of air strikes.

It was his harshest criticism yet of Putin, whom Trump has tried with little success to push into agreeing [a ceasefire with Ukraine.](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-calls-putin-vance-russia-doesnt-know-how-to-end-war-3701711?ico=in-line_link)

What his response lacked, though, was the type of clear consequence, which Ukraine and other Western countries have consistently argued is the only way to alter Putin’s approach.

Trump made no mention of military aid or increased pressure to negotiate.

In response to a reporter’s question earlier on Sunday, Trump said he would “absolutely” consider further sanctions, but seemed to drop the idea by the time of his Truth Social post.

In the hours that followed, Russia responded with another sweeping attack on Ukraine. Kyiv said it was hit with 355 drones and 9 cruise missiles from Sunday night into Monday, among the largest salvos of the war.

It seemed to illustrate that Trump’s warnings had done little to moderate Putin’s attacks.

In comments on Monday morning, the Kremlin defended its strikes as legitimate and said Trump has might be experiencing “emotional overload.”

It said it would keep engaging in the peace process championed by Trump, but had no deadlines in mind, perhaps calling to mind [fears Trump voiced last month](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/real-putin-clear-trump-hope-easy-peace-deal-3665441?srsltid=AfmBOoqoumK8VJ1TrDetk1WwjygdDx4vBsOzKjPVEqapvmajckU8Iwth&amp;ico=in-line_link) that Putin “doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.”

Seven of the largest drone and missile strikes during the war have now come since January 2025, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), undermining Trump’s claim that his re-entry to the White House would be a force for peace.

Putin is also strengthening his grip on the front lines as fighting intensifies and Russian forces advance in eastern Ukraine.

Russian forces are advancing at an average of roughly 14.3 square kilometres per day in Ukraine, the ISW estimates, albeit at the cost of an average 1,500 Russian casualties a day.

The weekend strikes proved too much for some even within Trump’s usually-loyal Republican Party.

“It is a time for honesty,” Congressman Don Bacon from Nebraska wrote on X as the Russian assault continued.

“Peace talks are having zero effect on Putin. His goal is to dominate Ukraine &amp; he won’t stop until he realises he cannot win.”

He called on the US and the West to “arm Ukraine to the teeth” and “sanction Russia to the max”.

Putin isn't in this for money, he's one of the richest men in the world. He's doing this because he truly believes in the idea of having spheres of influence. He divides the world up mentally into several parts and thinks each part should be ruled by a superpower who can dictate to the other nations in their sphere how to do things.

I don't remember if it was Times Radio or some other outlet. The woman went on about how Trump was shaking up the negotiations on Ukraine, Gaza and Iran all at the same time, and the interviewer seemed impressed for some reason. He said something to the effect that if Trump's shock tactics work and all these parties are forced to negotiate, Trump might become the most successful peacemaker ever. I rolled my eyes. And then the analyst lady started to talk about how Trump was hiring these super bright tech people that were going to fix everything. This was around the time Elon's DOGE kids were doxxed. 

I'm Finnish, and the conversation reminded me of a saying my dad used to say, which translates roughly as ""if I get this and that, then I'm only missing three out of five"". Meaning, I actually have fuck all together. Cut to the big surprise: Putin does not want peace and keeps bombing, Netanyahu kept bombing and is now committing forced relocation of the people of Gaza, which is a war crime, Iran is continuing as ever, and general genius Elon Musk has crashed Tesla and been thrown out of the White House (performatively at least).",2025-05-26T09:06:28

They are nearing a banking system crash at the moment. Their central bank has had a 21 % interest rate since last October, real inflation has been significantly *higher* than that despite the interest rate, lending to private industries has essentially stopped (except for the war industries), and reportedly one in six companies is effectively bankrupt. Once a run on the banks starts, it's not going to be possible to stop it.

Of course, that doesn't mean that whatever follows is better than the current Putin regime. Putin will try to use the financial crash to grab even more emergency powers.

Here in Europe, we're now spendig a lot more money on defense and military and while you might think that is the ultimate goal; the reality is that it is splitting a strong alliance in two. US has always been the bigger investor in military and defense compared to Europe, but it has never been because Europe didn't want to invest in it. The fact that US took a leading role in development and production of military equipment has made it very prosperous for US to supply Europe when it was needed while still hold a big arsenal. Now that will change: Trump is reducing the amount of money spent on US military in the fiscal budget, which ultimately is a HUGE economic sector and business in US, which now will slowly but surely move their business to Europe instead because there's money on the market here. They are businessmen, and they're loyal to money.

I do believe the US global image is a big factor that lends into the US acting as the world police. However the world (just like any individual) eventually gets tired of police forces, especially foreign ones. (Sometimes rightfully so because of corruption, corporate interests etc.) So the US gets a lot of blame for things when they “meddle in” or supply arms like you say i.e palestine/israel. So the country is put in a tough position, it gets critiqued for getting involved, it gets critiqued for not getting involved. Its a lose lose situation for us entirely. So cutting back on military spending and allowing other allied nations to increase theirs and pick up the small growth allows for the country itself to be able to refinance some of its sectors. The US needs to restructure their spending and the culture needs to shift with it as well. Europe has the biggest problem to deal with which is Communism in Russia and its own birthing problem as well. Doesn’t make a lot of sense for the USA to go far reaching halfway across the board when we deal with our own issues as well. Especially considering how much Europe depends on Russia for its natural resources etc. Which basically puts the USA in a weird dynamic where its like a parent telling their daughter not to go out with their toxic boyfriend because he abuses her, but she reluctantly continues to do so. Every-time the USA steps in we get put in the “your evil” by both parties and leaves the USA as the person solely wasting their resources and efforts on something that inadvertently is Europes own problem. As much as we are an ally we are also our own individual country with our own faults and problems of our own. If almost 100 years of being allies and friends seizes to stop because we cant help out in this instance or for couple of instances, then it seems like the relationship is one sided.",2025-05-26T15:19:51

It is however not a smart thing to go on your own and become isolationist. And yeah, it is tough to deal with conflicts going on in the world, which is kind of why most of us looked at the statements coming from Trump to begin with as bogus. We knew he couldn't bring anything to the table, and now he is running away from a problem he has created all by himself. The war was always going to happen, regardless of him. He has done nothing to show for. I get that it ruins a lot to have your ""foot in two lairs"" but thats the price you have to pay for taking such a position. And it isn't as easy to say ""Now we're done policing, your problem now"" when you kind of created the balance of the situation to begin with after WW2. Stepping down is OK, but stepping down with no plan for anyone to take over is reckless because it puts a target on your own back. 

First of all, communism isn't a problem in Europe and hasn't been ever since 1989 and even then communism wasn't really a problem. The problem has always been authoritarianism, regardless of what social economic side of the spectrum they'd take. We had a lot of democracies fight one another her in Europe. Most of the developed nations in Europe today has a mixed model with core principles from mercantilism and capitalism and the good ol' social economics from Marxism mixed with modernised democratic and civil policies. At the time they were implemented and developed the geopolitical structure of Europe was already a solid foundation. Communism was just bolsjeviks taking it a step too far, and they were destroyed by Stalin who took it into another direction. The ""fear"" of communism has always been an American talking point. Here in Europe it was really never an issue, and still isn't. The birthing problem is not a part of this at all, and is actually a huge social problem in the entire world, including US. 

Lets not talk about toxic relationships. We fought with US in the first gulf war, the Afghan war and the Iraq war, and the liberation of Libanon. Those were fought as allies, not because we wanted but because of the mutual alliance. If we were able to choose not to, we would and you can't change the rules now. If US won't help because you were occupied with your own internal conflicts, Europe will move forward dealing with their internal conflicts, and deal with Russia in Ukraine without US. But it will stain the alliance, and it will leave US much more vulnerable because of it. If you've been taught that the alliance has been a one-way relationship, you should do your due diligence to make sure you understand that it is of course not true. We've been co-depent.",2025-05-26T16:23:30

It is an opportunity for him to make shady deals with them. It's smart, having morals isn't smart, that's how his brain works.

Putin has always wanted  a transactional US that stops caring about democracy and resisting the spread of influence from authoritarian states. To get that he is willing to help and pay Trump. So he did help him in the elections, 2016 especially, but recent ones as well. And I am also quite sure he promised Trump during one of their private 'talks' (there is a reason why there were no US interpreters there) to reward him greatly for whatever he does for Russia in the future.

With so much going on I’ve not kept up closely with that war, and last I read (months ago) Russia was using soviet era ammo and gear because they’d used up most of their new stuff, and didn’t have the capacity to manufacture at rate that replaced what they were using up. Similar with troops - they’d used up a bunch and were so desperate they were sending prisoners, and even grabbing protesters off the street, charging them criminally, and eventually sending them to the front. Plus using North Korean and possibly Chinese troops because they needed the Man power.

 The attackers had numerous explosives, with the most powerful in the center of the auditorium. Spetsnaz operators from Federal Security Service (FSB) Alpha and Vympel, supported by a Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) SOBR unit, pumped a chemical agent into the building's ventilation system and began the rescue operation.[5]


The identity of the gas was not disclosed at the time, although it was believed to have been a fentanyl derivative.[6] A study published in 2012 concluded that it had been a mixture of carfentanil and remifentanil.[7]

 The same study pointed out that in a 2011 case at the European Court of Human Rights, the Russian government stated that the aerosol used was a mixture of a fentanyl derivative and a chemical compound with a narcotic action.[8]

Putin understands he can take certain actions and not face consequences, that's why he does what he does, he's former KGB , intellectually on a different planet to the guy who used to hang out with Jeffrey Epstein a lot. I'm not defending Putin here, just pointing why this is happening, I would argue Bush and Obama have to also shoulder some of the blame as they did very little to fend off Putin during the 2000s, I'll also blame my country, the UK and the EU too.


Remember the exact same narrative we see today was used by Putin to go into Georgia in 2008, albeit on a much smaller scale. Zero consequences, and that's why we have this horrendous situation in Ukraine",2025-05-26T11:08:43

Trump has bizarre temper tantrums and changes his mind on what he believes daily now. He'll be back to trying to negotiate a peace deal by the weekend, when his jealousy of Obama's Nobel Prize rises to the top of his addled brain again, but with each day of chaos and idiocy that passes he wrecks more of the US's economy and soft power... 

And Russia continues to make gains in Ukraine and run the Ukrainian's exhausted manpower reserves down more and more. Putin just needs to stall for time and he *knows* it. Why should Putin care that Trump is making dumb comments on Twitter, except to quietly rejoice at what another sign of a stupendously dumb and self inflicted wound Trumpism was to the West...?

And no amount of propaganda or treating war like a team sport on Reddit helps; no amount of ""ha ha we beat Russia with our spare weapons"" nonsense changes the facts that the US is falling into 1940s Germany, with a desperately unwell, ranting at imaginary bogeymen Fuhrer, *and none of the Reddit resistance is doing anything real to even save themselves*. Except maybe post more ""Russian Troll!"" comments, thus subtly suggesting that even *they* think Russia is all powerful...

Or indeed, actually making it worse; let's vote Reform into power in the UK! Brexit was such a resounding success after all, let's have more of that!

Putin is evil, a vicious dictator and organised crime boss; but he's not crazy. And that drives Trump crazy because he wishes he could be that successfully evil, because even as he loots the US dry it's never enough because he knows he's not feared, or darkly respected like Putin. Everyone *knows* Trump is a moron, including Trump. Meanwhile, we continue to blow our own feet off whilst impotently tut-tutting the latest Trump nonsense. And telling ourselves he's also right that Russia will fall. Any day now. Just like for the last 3 years. Any day now. We sent Abrahms. We sent missiles. We sent F-16s. Any day now, Russia will fall...

And still the front line moves slowly, slowly West.

1kvglwa,Trump blasts Russian leader: ‘I’m not happy with what Putin is doing,someopinionthatsr,0,2025-05-25T23:54:49,fungobat,1,"&gt;President Trump offered some of his toughest remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, saying he was “not happy” at all with Putin after the latest deadly attacks in Ukraine.

&gt;“Yeah, I’ll give you an update, I’m not happy with what Putin’s doing. He’s killing a lot of people and I don’t know what the hell happened to Putin,” Trump told reporters who asked for an update on Russia.

&gt;“I’ve known him a long time. Always gotten along with him. But he’s sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don’t like it at all. OK. We’re in the middle of talking and he’s shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities. I don’t like it at all,” Trump continued in remarks from Morristown, N.J., where he was preparing to take Air Force One back to Washington, D.C.

&gt;Trump also said he’s “surprised at what he’s seeing” and that new U.S. sanctions on Russia were a possibility.

&gt;“I’m surprised, I’m very surprised,” Trump said. “We’ll see what I’m going to do.

&gt;“I don’t like what Putin is doing. Not even a little bit. He’s killing people. And something happened to this guy. And I don’t like it.”",2025-05-25T23:57:54

&gt;“Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”

Trump promised to end the war on ""day one,"" but during his first call to Putin, they chatted about their ""shared history"" and discussed how Trump could help Russia seize control of one-fifth of Ukraine's land. 

Immediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a ""dictator""

Trump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies went on for weeks denigrating Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.

In fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.

Trump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to ""negotiate"" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.

Trump had the gall to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.

The truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.

Every ""deal* he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.

He even called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius"" and ""savvy."" 

Trump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely. And if you're not aware, weakening NATO is one of Putin's most ambitious goals. 

Trump has practically glorified Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.

Trump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.

Trump has defended Putin throughout his presidency, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a ""killer"" who murders his political opponents.

During his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over US military outposts that Trump had abandoned.

Trump also effectively ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald ""bone spurs"" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed them to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.

And let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after Trump demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are a crucial supply for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.

And look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been a long-standing ally and useful idiot to Putin, but what's especially concerning right now is how Trump cares next to nothing about ""ending the war"" in Ukraine, and cares far more about getting the credit for it.

He wants nothing more than to be awarded the title of ""peacemaker,"" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, weakening our alliances, and offering up a large chunk of Ukraine's territory to Russia with no specific security guarantees in return.

He'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.

Putin is a dangerous expansionist on a campaign to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.

Trump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, all so he can later resume a freshly organized and equipped ""special military operation"" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.

Putin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.

For Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",2025-05-25T22:16:29

1kvauxr,Zelensky says 'US silence' over Russian attacks encourages Putin,aslan_is_on_the_move,371,2025-05-25T19:28:46,inthekeyofc,1,"Mr President, 

With all due respect to your stated concern about the war in Ukraine people are dying because of your inaction, and your inability to reign in Putin’s expansionist ambitions.

Putin's talk of peace is nothing more than a smokescreen for his real intentions. Nothing coming out of the Kremlin tells us anything other than it's their intention to progress this war to its fullest to take over the whole of Ukraine and eradicate Ukrainian identity and culture, even if that means killing millions of Ukrainians in the process.* That is the message in their media and that is the message from their politicians.** And you yourself are ridiculed.*** 

Make no mistake; there is no intention on Russia’s part to end this war. Therefore the only way to end it is to force Putin to stop attacking Ukraine and remove his forces from the country. That can only be achieved by arming Ukraine so that they can defend themselves and repel Russia's invasion, and by reducing Russia ability to finance the war through increased sanctions.

Failure to act will see the brutal subjugation of an ally whose soldiers died alongside America’s in the Iraq war, followed by a war crime of the proportions we haven't seen since the Nazi crimes of World War 2. And the world will see you, and America, as complicit in that.

As for your fear of nuclear war, Putin relies on your fear to get you to do his bidding. The question is, is it a genuine threat or a bluff? We cannot know for certain, but I would ask, if Putin was prepared to use nuclear weapons to win this war, why hasn’t he already?

In both instances, North Korea played Rice and the State Department for fools, constantly promising to stop production of enriched uranium in exchange for US concessions. First it was removing the DPRK from the state-sponsors of terrorism list, then it was releasing 25 million USD worth of assets back to them (via a Russian bank proxy no less as even China was reluctant to facilitate such a massive concession), then they ran-out the clock with them, inevitably leading to Obama's continuous difficulties navigating the situation across his term (which he speaks to in his memoirs as well, essentially concurring with Cheney that the State Department massively underestimated the DPRK's political maneavuring). Cheney - though I thought some of his memoir's chapters were padded with patriotic fluff, or outright lacking substantive detail - did also provide some pretty prophetic warnings about Putin, saying he saw an ""old hand of the KGB"" in him and never once trusted him, that Putin was desperate ('longed') to return ('turn back the clock') to the oppositional geopolitics of the Cold War and exert Russia's influence over the former Soviet Republics.

1kufqdz,Trump shows unusual patience as Putin stalls on Ukraine,NeighborhoodSilver24,0,2025-05-24T16:32:55,I405CA,8,"Trump admires Putin, and wants to be like Putin when he grows up.  Trump views Putin as a winner, so he wants Putin to win because he believes that he deserves to win.

At the same time, Trump envies Obama for having won the Nobel Peace Prize and believes that he should get one for himself.  So he is eager to achieve a cease fire in the belief that this will lead him to the Nobel.

Ergo, all of this drama.  He wants a peace that rewards his role model Putin, which really means that he wants Ukraine to surrender.  But because Ukraine isn't capitulating as it should, Trump is left with all of this back and forth.

The only pathway to peace is for Russia to lose.  If the US isn't going to make that happen, then that leaves it to the Europeans, Aussies and Canadians to arm the Ukrainians to the hilt.  Do it now.",2025-05-24T16:42:30

Greatest of all plans indeed. I bet he'd take credit for it too lol

Just like Gaza, taxes or Iran, going in but not having an ACTUAL plan and more like going in with planned fail, just fot the sake of ""but we tried"".

All that while his real plan was to actually gain personal wealth and lower taxes for the richest.

He blamed ""sleepy Joe"" for all kinds of silly stuff, but he singlehandedly made the US a laughing stock when it comes to deals, a country that can't be trusted on anything. All of that by ""greatest dealmaker"", who just happened to bankrupt multiple times due to his great deals.

But Rubio is probably the least stupid and the least sociopathic out of the lot of them. He’s been given this huge gig but to keep the gig he has to defend everything the administration is doing. You can actually sometimes see the pain on his face as he gets ready to fire horse manure. I’m from UK so a bit of an outsider but I don’t actually think he’s a bad person at heart. He’s just got the best gig of his life at the worst time. He could probably do better later by speaking out now. As time won’t be kind to any of them. Be your own man.

Trade between the US and Russia is pretty minimal at the moment, putting a tariff on it is not going to change much. (That's direct trade. Of course e.g. US electronic components still find their way to Russian weapons via other countries.)

But let's see. Lindsey Graham is heading and effort to expand the sanctions in a significant way to third parties, i.e. sanctioning countries that buy Russian oil. He has bipartisan support for it. If Trump blocks that, and he's made that kind of noises, it's a pretty good sign that he's not actually willing to stop Putin.",2025-05-21T22:58:38

More like ""I want to be him."" Trump admires the way Putin controls the Russian oligarchy and takes a cut of everything. He has stolen an amazing amount of wealth, and he makes the Russian oligarchs jump when he tells them. Trump would like nothing better, especially now that he has a good taste of it (US tech oligarchs lining up to fund the inauguration and to visit Mar-a-Lago).

On the other hand, Trump wants to claim that he accomplished peace in Ukraine. He doesn't give two squirts of diarrhea in his diaper about Ukraine, but he wants to be seen as the great peacemaker. Putin doesn't want, and can't personally afford, peace. In his case, it would likely be career- and life-ending. That's the actual conflict between them.",2025-05-21T16:28:25

&gt;Some politicians go whichever way the wind blows. Not, however, the US’s esteemed leader, Donald Trump. He is such a force of nature that he can dictate the direction of the wind. During his first term, he suggested “nuking hurricanes” to stop them from hitting the country. A few weeks after that, Trump seemed to think he could alter the course of Hurricane Dorian with a black marker, scribbling over an official map to change its anticipated trajectory in an incident now known as Sharpiegate. Weirdly, Dorian did not end up following Trump’s orders. Hurricanes can be uncooperative like that.

&gt;Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"" to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".

The Soviets cared about ideology back then, because the country was founded on it. So at least tankies for all their flaws had that going for them. Today their only ideology is Russian imperialism. Funnily enough, they aren't even silent about it. Their whole plan is out in the open, yet us Europeans in particular are acting like it's just empty words and hot air, or that it's just Putin, and we're totally not going to end up at war with them eventually. Anyway, some more:

&gt;The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from the European Union.  




&gt;Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and ""United Ossetia"" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia and the Republic of North Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.



&gt;Ukraine (except Western Ukraine) should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"".

This quote always speaks to me because in our tradition, that has almost always been the case for why the majority revolt or rebel. 

The Boston Tea Party itself really had nothing to do with taxation and representation, but rather smugglers who were angry that the tax on *legitimate tea* was *lowered*. Even the taxation that did exist happened because British subjects insisted upon pushing westward into indigenous territory, and the British government wanted them to quit it (not out of the kindness of their hearts or anything, it was expensive and a provocation), and inevitably, settlers did not quit it, started a war, and the British government had to send in troops. The whole endeavor was indeed expensive. But all of these factors contributed to the American Revolution, not so much because colonial (white) Americans were so oppressed, but because they *felt oppressed*. (While simultaneously actually oppressing people.) 

This is very British, and in British history most riots were about a perceived, or real, loss of privilege rather than how we envision a riot being the language of the unheard (in MLK’s words). Lots and lots of them were about taxes or the threat of taxes or the rumors of the threat of taxes. Our more modern philosophical justifications for violence, particularly when it comes to actual oppressed peoples striking back, wasn’t in play back then. 

I hate to say it, but MAGA is very much revolting in the long Anglo-American tradition of staging an epic temper tantrum over issues that are absolutely not oppression, but rather a loss (or perceived loss) of privilege.",2025-05-20T18:06:31

They knew American yammering about mutual defense and defense spending as a percentage of GDP was worse than meaningless ever since Americans ceded control over their thermonuclear arsenal to a Russian puppet who is destroying NATO and threatening to invade and annex Canada and a piece of Denmark. And that is without discussing the Pentagon's gargantuan, multidecadal procurement fraud, which artificially inflates defense spending as a % of GDP.

All the fighter planes in the world are useless if you simply surrender control of your entire country to Russia, without any significant resistance, in the most cowardly fashion. Not just once, but twice, when you had another 4 years to condemn this treasonist to death like the Rosenbergs. Apparently their lives didn't matter, and Trump is a million times worse.

However, in a follow-up conference call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and Finland, Trump stated that Putin had only agreed to discuss a ceasefire, and that the U.S. would not be involved in the negotiations.

European leaders on the call were reportedly “surprised” by how willing the U.S. president appeared to be to abandon the idea of trying to broker a deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.

2) Made a bullshit claim, knowing that it was a lie.

Cultists, you can't just make an excuse after the fact and blame it on someone else. Tramp is the one who made these claims. He clamed he could end the war in 24 hours. He claimed he would lower taxes and make tips/OT tax free. He claimed he could turn the economy in a very short period of time. He claimed he could build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. 

Even if you use excuses, the fact is, he failed to come through on these promises. Therefore, he made promises he couldn't keep. You know damn well that's unacceptable.

The US president said the two-hour conversation went “very well”, and that Ukraine and Russia are to start ceasefire talks “immediately”.

In a post on social media he wrote: “Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War.”

But despite the upbeat comments, Moscow has not yet agreed to any of the key objectives set out by Washington, prompting one former European leader to frame the call as “a win for Putin.”

Here *The i Paper* takes a look at what we’ve learnt from the latest talks.   

# Trump hails ‘excellent’ call – but so far no one has fundamentally changed their stance 

The first reports from the phone call painted a rosy picture, with Trump and Putin on friendly terms and addressing each other by their first names.

“Trump said: ‘Vladimir, you can pick up the phone at any time, and I will be happy to answer and speak with you,”‘ Russian presidential adviser Yuri Ushakov said.

The US president said his talk with Putin went “very well” and was “excellent”, adding: “If it wasn’t, I would say so now, rather than later.”

Moscow, he said, will “propose and is ready to work with” Ukraine on a “memorandum” outlining the framework for “a possible future peace treaty.”

He said that if appropriate agreements were reached, there could be a ceasefire, adding that direct talks between Russia and Ukraine gave “reason to believe that we are generally on the right track.”

But both leaders were unchanged on their negotiating positions.

Putin said “Russia’s position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis.”

He also refused to support the US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire, a key element of Monday’s phone call.

[Russia’s requests, including taking Crimea and Donbas ](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-and-putins-call-opens-the-door-to-talks-but-in-ukraine-the-fighting-will-go-on-3703068?ico=in-line_link)and keeping Ukraine out of Nato, have been repeatedly rejected by Kyiv.

Trump also reverted to his previous threat of walking away.

He told reporters in the Oval Office: “I think something’s going to happen and, if it doesn’t I’d just back away and they have to keep going. This was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation.

“This is not my war.”",2025-05-20T08:38:50

Trump revealed that the new Pope Leo XIV had offered up the Vatican as a potential venue for ceasefire talks. 

“The Vatican, as represented by the Pope, has stated that it would be very interested in hosting the negotiations. Let the process begin!” he posted on Truth Social.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said leaders had welcomed the pontiff’s offer, and that “Italy is ready to do its part to facilitate contacts and work for peace.”

Pope Leo, the first US leader of the global Catholic Church, has previously said the Vatican could act as a mediator in global conflicts.

“The Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face-to-face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace,” he said last week.

A Kremlin spokesman said Moscow was aware of the Pope’s offer but that the issue of the Vatican “was not discussed in specifics” during the phone call.

Trump was also questioned by reporters as to whether holding talks at the Vatican meant the US was stepping away – a suggestion he denied.

“No, no, no, I think it would be great to have at the Vatican, perhaps it would have some extra significance,” he said. ",2025-05-20T08:38:57

Although Trump said that the two sides will “immediately” begin ceasefire negotiations, no date for such talks has yet been set. Nor is it clear who might participate.

It is also unclear whether talks would be run separately from those that began last Friday in Istanbul.

That discussion – the first between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in three years – helped bring about a limited exchange of prisoners, but did not pause the fighting.

Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Trump and Putin did not discuss a timeline for a ceasefire but did discuss trading nine Russians for nine Americans in a prisoner swap.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there were “no deadlines” for a memorandum on Ukraine.

“There are no deadlines and there cannot be any. It is clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but, of course, the devil is in the details,” the RIA agency quoted him as saying.

European leaders and Ukraine have demanded Russia agree to a ceasefire immediately, and Trump has focused on getting Putin to commit to a 30-day truce. Putin has resisted this, insisting that conditions be met first.",2025-05-20T08:39:05

After speaking to Putin, Trump held another call with Volodymyr Zelensky, and with the leaders of the European Union, France, Italy, Germany and Finland to relay the details.

Zelensky said “this is a defining moment”, and urged the US not to distance itself from talks.

After speaking with Trump, Zelensky said Kyiv and its partners may push for a high-level meeting among Ukraine, Russia, the United States, European Union countries and Britain as part of a push to end the war.

In a post on X, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the conversation with Trump was “good” and it was “important that the US stays engaged.”

But not everyone was impressed.

Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said the call with Trump was “undoubtedly a win for Putin.”

The Russian leader “deflected the call for an immediate ceasefire and instead can continue military operations at the same time as he puts pressure on at the negotiating table,” he wrote.

One person familiar with Trump’s call with the Ukrainian and European leaders said participants were “shocked” that the US leader did not want to push Putin with sanctions, *Reuters* reported.

Late on Monday night German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said European leaders decided to increase pressure on Russia through sanctions after Trump briefed them on his call.

Trump did not appear ready to follow that move.

Asked why he had not imposed fresh sanctions to push Moscow into a peace deal as he has threatened, Trump told reporters: “Well because I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you can also make it much worse. But there could be a time where that’s going to happen.”",2025-05-20T08:39:14

I still remember watching the interview he did at the National Association of Black Journalists (the one where he claimed that Kamala wasn't black) and one part that stood out to me was when he talked about inflation.

He actually acknowledged that deflation is much worse than inflation (which it is), so actually lowering prices is off the table. Weirdly, no one ever quoted him on that. He basically admitted in that moment that all of this talk about ""lowering prices"" was just straight up lies.

And then he said something that was so idiotic that i don't even know how to respond to that. Basically he said that the true inflation rate was much worse than we think, because some things like interest rates aren't accounted in it. Interest rates are the primary tool used to curb inflation. That means that they are inversely correlated. Low interest rates lead to high inflation and vice versa.

So either he doesn't know how inflation works, OR he is lying to justify lowering interest rates. Because for billionaires like him, low interest rates are a dream. He doesn't give a fuck about inflation, he just wants to enrich himself. And he isn't even particularly subtle about it.

Then again, why would he?",2025-05-20T15:28:25

This Ukraine peace summit has not yet turned into the spectacular win Donald Trump hoped for. While Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to Turkey, as suggested by Vladimir Putin last week, the Russian leader is nowhere to be seen.

This meeting will not, therefore, provide a springboard to a Nobel Peace Prize which Trump so desperately craves, to match Barack Obama. As with his mediation with Israel over Gaza, which the US President glossed over during his glittering meetings with Arab leaders this week, it is all proving too difficult.

As a result, Trump is slinking away from his boasts that he could sort out two of the world’s major conflicts “alone” and on “day one”. That could be very good news for Ukraine if it finally kills the fading bromance between Trump and Putin. It means the United States may revert to where it was before the Trump 2.0 whirlwind: grudgingly sticking with its allies over the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

A few days ago, after Putin suggested meeting Zelensky in Turkey, Trump backed the Russians on social media: “President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this IMMEDIATELY.”

Under pressure from the White House, the Ukrainian President agreed to turn up without preconditions. This flattered Trump, with whom the Ukrainian leader had already started to rebuild relations after the low of his Oval Office ambush. Zelensky was essential in helping the President grab the headlines at the Pope’s funeral, with the full consent of the Vatican, by pow-wowing with him in full view of the cameras.

But Putin didn’t turn up on Thursday, and Zelensky described the strikingly low-level Russian delegation fielded as a “theatre prop” and “a sham”. No Putin, no foreign minister Sergey Lavrov; the team is instead officially headed by an obscure former culture minister called Vladimir Medinsky.

It now appears that the Russian President set up these peace talks in the hope of humiliating Zelensky. Had he turned up, the Russian would have been meeting the Ukrainian as an equal. That never seemed likely, and the Kremlin has been quick to mock Zelensky as a “clown” and a “loser”. The most likely scenario is that these talks will not result in a ceasefire but relatively minor agreements, such as the exchange of prisoners of war.

Until Air Force One heads back to the US, there is still a chance that the diplomatic sparring could result in the sort of headline-grabbing drama Trump loves. He said today that he still might go to Istanbul this week, where delegations from Ukraine and Russia are due to meet to discuss ceasefire plans.

That would put him back on centre stage. As he told reporters accompanying him: “Nothing is going to happen until Putin and I get together.” Speaking in Qatar, he held back on criticising the Russians’ no-show today, mumbling: “I don’t think he’s going to go if I don’t go.”

A few months ago, comments from Trump, JD Vance and others suggested that the new US administration had swallowed Russia’s propaganda that Zelensky and his government could be brushed aside. Some even dismissed Zelensky as a “dictator”. No longer.

There is no doubt that Trump’s patience with Putin is fraying. Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio is attending a Nato foreign ministers meeting in Antalaya, Turkey, at which the UK’s David Lammy declared, “We come with one message to stand by Ukraine and ensure that we get a just and lasting, enduring peace.”

The most likely outcome of this week’s drama is that the US will continue to supply and support Ukraine militarily and move towards tougher sanctions on Russia, unless Putin comes to the table with concessions on Russia’s maximalist demands.

Most importantly, Zelensky and Ukraine remain an equal in this great game – he has not been squeezed out by the vanity of the US President or the machinations of the Russian leader.",2025-05-19T17:40:38

BIGLY Peace Talks and a Very Special Ceasefire in Ukraine (Also Real Estate Opportunities in Siberia)

Transcript:

President Putin:
Agent Krasnov, I trust you are well.

Mr. Trump:
Very well, thank you, Vladimir. Don’t call me Krasnov.  Can I just say, you’re looking strong. Really strong. Probably the strongest leader anywhere. Some people say I’m strong too but you, you’re next level. Honestly, I wish I had generals like yours. The Pentagon is full of losers.

President Putin:
You are too kind. I believe we have matters to discuss — Ukraine, primarily.

Mr. Trump:
Yes, yes — the Ukraine thing. Listen, I think we should do a ceasefire. A beautiful ceasefire. The best ceasefire. Nobody knows ceasefires like I do.

President Putin:
Is that so? And what terms would you propose, Mr. Trump?

Mr. Trump:
Well, obviously, it has to be bigly. Bold. Maybe just you say, “It’s paused,” and boom, it’s paused. Tremendous optics. I’ll even tweet it — or, Truth it — “Victory Through Strength™.” Sound good?

President Putin:
Interesting approach. I shall consider your suggestion. What would be the incentive for Russia?

Mr. Trump:
Easy. I tell NATO it’s your idea. They’ll freak out. That’s leverage. Plus — and this is just between us Vlad — I’ve always thought Crimea had great real estate potential. Resort quality. So underappreciated!

President Putin:
You continue to surprise me.

Mr. Trump:
Vlad, I’m just saying — I’d live in Russia. Absolutely. You’ve got class. You’ve got bears. No woke generals. Honestly, Mar-a-Lago Siberia? That could be a thing.

President Putin:
You are welcome to visit. I will have a dacha prepared. Possibly near Lake Baikal.

Mr. Trump:
A dacha! Beautiful. You know, I’ve always loved your palaces — the marble, the chandeliers. Not like Delaware. Total dump.  I can help you build a wall in Lake Baikal, Vlad. Nobody builds walls better than me. I’ll even draw you a diagram — very classy, very high, with gold trim. Maybe I can ask Ivanka to help.

President Putin:
We build the best walls Mr Trump to the highest standards. A wall... with gold trim. I like that idea a lot.

Mr. Trump:
And can I get one of those shirtless horseback calendars? Just asking. For the golf locker.

President Putin:
Da, It will be sent with expedited priority DHL.

Mr. Trump:
Thanks, That’s why I love you, Vlad. You get things done.  Best gift ever. I’m putting it up in Mar-a-Lago. Right next to the portrait of me hugging an eagle and my Bible.

President Putin:
You mentioned Crimea's resort potential earlier. Do you have ideas beyond gold-trimmed walls?

Mr. Trump:
Oh, absolutely. Picture this: Trump Dacha &amp; Spa™ — five stars, beachfront, all-you-can-eat caviar bar. Tremendous value. I know property, believe me. And guess what? I’m bringing Florida oranges.

President Putin:
Oranges?

Mr. Trump:
Yes — the best oranges. Very juicy. Not like your Russian ones. Do you even have oranges? Probably not. I could start a trade deal — Oranges for Oil. Think about it: ""Operation Vitamin C."" Your soldiers could use the antioxidants.

President Putin:
That is... unconventional. But we are always open to trade.

Mr. Trump:
And listen — food diplomacy? Huge. You know what people love? Big Macs. I had McDonald’s in the White House. I personally served it. Historic moment. People loved it.

President Putin:
I recall the photographs of you wearing Macdonald hat.

Mr. Trump:
Exactly! I looked so good. Look — if you put a McDonald’s in Red Square, peace will follow. You know what they say: no one nukes where they eat nuggets.

President Putin:
In Soviet times, that would have been treason. Now... it’s capitalism. Things evolve.

Mr. Trump:
You evolve well, Vlad. You’re like a Pokémon — strong, tactical, shirtless.

President Putin:
What is a Pokémon?

Mr. Trump:
Never mind. The point is — I know power when I see it. And you’ve got it. You’re like the Steve Jobs of geopolitics, except with tanks instead of turtlenecks.

President Putin:
Da. Very... diplomatic. Good bye Donald. Much love to Melania.

Mr. Trump:
Good bye Vladimir.

His call with [Vladimir Putin ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/vladimir-putin?ico=in-line_link)– their second publicly-disclosed conversation since Trump returned to office, although there could have been others – could determine [nothing less than the future of the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-ignored-uk-eu-ceasefire-what-it-means-peace-ukraine-3688509?ico=in-line_link).

It also gives Putin the chance to embarrass Trump on the world stage.

Throughout last year’s US election campaign, Trump insisted he would resolve conflict on the first day of his presidency. He now says those claims were “sarcastic”, yet insisted last week that “nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together”.

The President was speaking after Putin failed to travel to Istanbul for talks with the Ukrainians that the Kremlin leader had personally proposed less than a week earlier.

Instead, Moscow sent a low-level delegation to meet [Volodymyr Zelensky ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky?ico=in-line_link)that did not even include Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.

The Ukrainian leader, waiting on the banks of the Bosphorus, dismissed the Kremlin’s delegation as a “dummy” grouping. In turn, Moscow accused Zelensky of being a “pathetic loser clown”.

The resulting talks ended with an agreement for each side to swap 1,000 prisoners of war – [but no sign of a ceasefire, let alone an end to the war](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/detached-from-reality-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-finish-in-under-two-hours-3699702?ico=in-line_link).

Into this morass, Trump now intends to reinsert himself, saying he will speak to Putin and Zelensky separately on Monday, as well as “VARIOUS MEMBERS OF NATO” – demonstrating the seriousness of the moment by employing all-caps on his Truth Social platform.

“HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump said.",2025-05-19T07:59:32
1kq66l8,Trump risks giving Putin the chance to humiliate him,theipaper,124,2025-05-19T07:59:17,theipaper,3,"It is clear that, despite continued European efforts, [Trump views himself as the vital player in securing peace](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-no-peace-ukraine-without-him-3698396?ico=in-line_link).

“Obviously \[Putin\] wasn’t going to go,” he told reporters last week, referring to the talks in Istanbul. Offering no evidence to back up his claim, he argued that Putin had abandoned plans to meet Zelensky because Trump himself was not going to attend the talks.

But having declared himself indispensable to the process, Trump runs the risk of a very public and damaging failure if he is unable to prod Putin in the direction of at least a 30-day ceasefire.

So far, the Kremlin leader has outpaced Trump at every turn, while Russian forces continue to unleash death and destruction on Ukraine.

Last month, Trump used his social media account publicly to plead with Putin to embrace a ceasfire. “Vladimir, STOP!” he wrote, describing himself as “not happy with Russian strikes on Kyiv. Not necessary and very bad timing”. But Putin utterly disregarded the message.

Several days later, Trump’s patience with the Russian leader appeared to be wearing even thinner.

“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas,” he wrote. “It makes me think that he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently”.

Yet none of those messages has yet given rise to any change in Trump’s position, and he remains curiously credulous of Putin while constantly flaying Zelensky in public.

In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump again sounded far more sympathetic to Putin’s plight than to the suffering of Zelensky and his fellow Ukrainians. He angrily claimed that Zelensky had “pissed away” American assistance provided to Kyiv, and repeated entirely false claims that Ukrainian officials had stolen billions of dollars in aid.

Pressed over whether he will support fresh [sanctions on Russia ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sanctions-against-russia?srsltid=AfmBOorlwWCT8HCdtiGS3scNV16bhi97igllVft4QzDXSnrYQdnUoGXc&amp;ico=in-line_link)that are being proposed by Senate Republicans and European leaders, Trump demurred, and chose to leave all his options open.

“Nobody uses leverage better than me,” he claimed, but then conceded that he would “rather not” impose more sanctions that would be “crushing for the Russian economy”.",2025-05-19T07:59:52
1kq66l8,Trump risks giving Putin the chance to humiliate him,theipaper,124,2025-05-19T07:59:17,theipaper,6,"He argued that any decision would only come after Monday’s call with Putin. “We’re talking turkey, and we’ll see what happens,” he said.

Trump’s critics contend that he is already a busted flush, incapable of being an honest broker given his oft-stated sympathy for Russia, and viewed by the Kremlin as easy meat for Putin to prey upon.

Moscow knows that in preliminary talks, Trump has already pledged to oppose [Nato](https://inews.co.uk/topic/nato?ico=in-line_link) membership for Ukraine, and to support the partial dismemberment of the country by granting Russia sovereignty over the [Crimean Peninsula ](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-annex-crimea-why-putin-invaded-2014-what-happened-nato-annexation-explained-1424682?srsltid=AfmBOoq2nc3ZfsMeGxXYpU2qUVxBg9itNxxZW3iLaIKfrjO82ebRDkjF&amp;ico=in-line_link)and parts of eastern Ukraine.

Putin also knows that Trump is refusing to commit to any US military resources to provide security guarantees in post-war Ukraine, meaning the Russian leader can continue harbouring hopes of eventually witnessing his forces seizing Kyiv.

On Sunday, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said he and other European leaders – including [Sir Keir Starmer](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sir-keir-starmer?ico=in-line_link) – planned to speak with Trump before his call with Putin.

Just a week ago, the leaders had [travelled to Kyiv to publicly embrace Zelensky](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-finally-aligned-europe-ukraine-will-stop-putin-3687035?ico=in-line_link), and sought to secure Trump’s backing in a group call.

Now, by seizing the lead position in talks with both Putin and Zelensky, Trump is expressing supreme confidence in his own diplomatic capacities.

The US President has an uncanny ability to spin political failures as apparent evidence of his negotiating acumen.

But as he said himself on Truth Social, the war in Ukraine continues to be a “BLOODBATH”.

Putin and Zelensky know that Trump’s credibility in Europe now hinges significantly on them.

1kp2nfs,Trump says he will call Putin to discuss stopping Ukraine war,HotHuckleberry8904,32,2025-05-17T20:35:32,Choice-of-SteinsGate,3,"One of the last times he called Putin, they chatted about their ""shared history"" and discussed how Trump could help Russia seize control of one-fifth of Ukraine's land. 

Immediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a ""dictator""

Trump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies went on for weeks denigrating Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.

In fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.

Trump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to ""negotiate"" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.

Trump had the gall to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.

The truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.

Every ""deal* he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.

He even called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius"" and ""savvy."" 

Trump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely. And if you're not aware, weakening NATO is one of Putin's most ambitious goals. 

Trump has practically glorified Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.

Trump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.

Trump has defended Putin throughout his presidency, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a ""killer"" who murders his political opponents.

During his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over US military outposts that Trump had abandoned.

Trump also effectively ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald ""bone spurs"" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed them to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.

And let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after Trump demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are a crucial supply for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.

And look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been a long-standing ally and useful idiot to Putin, but what's especially concerning right now is how Trump cares next to nothing about ""ending the war"" in Ukraine, and cares far more about getting the credit for it.

He wants nothing more than to be awarded the title of ""peacemaker,"" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, weakening our alliances, and offering up a large chunk of Ukraine's territory to Russia with no specific security guarantees in return.

He'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.

Putin is a dangerous expansionist on a campaign to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.

Trump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, all so he can later resume a freshly organized and equipped ""special military operation"" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.

Putin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.

For Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",2025-05-17T23:14:46

I don't expect any concession from Russia.
They ran out of money for some things at the end of last year — they actually had to print money via a government order to pay for tank refurbishing, and its National Wealth Fund (NWF) is now about 40% of what it was (that fund being for stabilization, not spending; not having it available due to overspending will complicate a lot of things. And NWF should rize a lot during war due to various reasons I won't even attempt to summarize).
But Putin just broke the money banks by throwing a few oligarchs out the window. I'm afraid we're in for at least a year more.
Though we have already seen some issues with money, and the new European batch of sanctions is having quite a bit of success, especially targeting Russia’s shadow fleet. Already, 2 tankers have been stopped. While it's clearly not a lot, it’s significant when you consider that it was done with only the draft of an idea for the sanction.",2025-05-17T18:53:44

Trump changes his mind for the highest bidder and best deals. Money and power, part of the latter coming in the form of ego-boosting deals that ‘he’ makes claims to have ‘successfully’ bartered himself. 

Sadly, we all know how this will go, Trump gets a great deal from Russia and Ukraine are left with nothing for all the fighting they have done.

And of course he’ll probably sell some planes from failing company Boeing, probably getting a lot of commission being their greatest ‘salesman’ (if his family and friends are not already owning a lot of shares in Boeing). 

That and SpaceX benefitted from Russian rockets and scientists to further its own advancement in the space game… And let’s not get started on ‘The Boring (rare earth mining) Company’, you know where this is going, right?",2025-05-18T10:15:41

That has been the Russian position and it has not budged. Trump says stop the killing. Russia has been ramping up for summer offensive and Trump has threatened Putin with more sanctions along with EU.

The only thing that happened in Istanbul is exchange of prisoners. Prisoner exchange never stopped. Those types of deals are easy. The hard part is Ukraine wants to keep its territories or at least not cede anything permanently. There is not going to be any peace under these circumstances. Russian chief negotiator said that if there is no peace now, the next time they are at the table it will be discussion about 8 Oblasts instead of 4 as it is doing now.

The only positive thing is they agreed to meet again with each side presenting a path forward towards a ceasefire. Everyone knows what that position are. Oceans Apart.

1kmmwcr,Inside Putin's mind - and how he plans to outsmart Trump,theipaper,7,2025-05-14T18:38:55,theipaper,1,"[Vladimir Putin](https://inews.co.uk/topic/vladimir-putin?ico=in-line_link) loves to keep rivals guessing. On big matters, and small.

Ahead of the [proposed Ukraine peace summit](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-russia-talks-zelensky-confirms-meeting-putin-3688112?ico=in-line_link) in Turkey on Thursday, [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?ico=in-line_link), [Volodymyr Zelensky ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky?ico=in-line_link)and onlooking European leaders including [Sir Keir Starmer](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sir-keir-starmer?ico=in-line_link) will be wondering what’s going through the Russian president’s mind.

Would Putin really consider pausing and ultimately stopping his invasion in days, weeks or months? And if so, on what terms? Or is his only plan to string the West along while he [continues fighting](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-ignored-uk-eu-ceasefire-what-it-means-peace-ukraine-3688509?ico=in-line_link), still purely determined to not just weaken Ukraine but defeat it?

This might seem difficult to judge, when the Kremlin has even kept international leaders in the dark this week about whether Putin will attend the talks. Trump himself admitted on Wednesday morning that he still was not sure.

Maintaining uncertainty is just one tactic in his wider strategy, according to Sir Laurie Bristow. He met the dictator several times while serving as the UK’s ambassador to Russia from 2016 to 2020.

“Everything is a power game,” explains Bristow, saying Putin’s calculations are based on who he is facing and his ability to control them.",2025-05-14T18:39:14
1kmmwcr,Inside Putin's mind - and how he plans to outsmart Trump,theipaper,7,2025-05-14T18:38:55,theipaper,2,"Whoever shows up in Turkey, Russia’s main goal right now is “manipulating the negotiation process”, says Bristow. Reluctant to make compromises, Putin will try to ensure that any talks focus on the “things he wants”. His [ability to influence the US President ](https://inews.co.uk/news/trumps-long-standing-infatuation-with-putin-is-about-to-meet-its-ultimate-test-3666416?srsltid=AfmBOoqU29LmfCTTAkgnumWboaw0rhFkL68uXkGKF-1Mbjm1vbNRt-UG&amp;ico=in-line_link)will also be in question.

“It’s obvious he’s trying to play Trump,” says Bristow. “He wants to, as far as possible, [detach the US from Europe’s security](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-putin-call-confirms-europe-faces-russia-alone-3593464?srsltid=AfmBOooU82fHEdgmShdczdGPCbEED2xZQwNBcr-jwi2gRgMPhzUnkW2Q&amp;ico=in-line_link). He thinks he’s got a big opportunity to do that… \[and\] that the longer this conflict goes on, the more chance there is of Trump losing interest.”

Undermining Zelensky, potentially provoking him into angering Trump in a repeat of their [explosive Oval Office meeting in February](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/three-astonishing-things-trump-said-to-zelensky-in-white-house-shouting-match-3560887?srsltid=AfmBOooSDc0OIentKQM45nlF4fn9q0Z-z6gaWP-LzOgCZzijHV9CySMo&amp;ico=in-line_link), “is probably Putin’s game this week”.

However, the Russian president will be wary of humiliating Trump, according to the author Philip Short. He spent eight years researching every detail of the Russian leader’s life for his acclaimed biography [*Putin: His Life and Times*](https://www.waterstones.com/book/putin/philip-short/9781784700935).

“He wants to persuade Trump that Zelensky is the guy who’s holding things up,” says Short. “He does not want Trump to turn against him and decide that the Russians are responsible for what’s happening – as of course they are.” It’s still conceivable that in this scenario, the White House would decide to back Ukraine after all.

If Putin does engage in diplomacy sincerely, his red lines seem obvious to the author. “He would not agree to Ukraine joining [Nato](https://inews.co.uk/topic/nato?ico=in-line_link), or the Europeans putting troops in to give security guarantees. He would want limits on the Ukrainian armed forces. These would all be very difficult for Zelensky to accept.”

It is now widely accepted by many Western diplomats that Russia is unlikely to be pushed back, at least in the coming months. They think Ukraine will have to sacrifice some or all of its occupied territory to secure a long-term peace deal that protects the rest of the country. “Everybody knows, at some point, this is going to have to finish with negotiations,” says Short.

That will require both sides to seek peace. And right now, neither expert believes that Putin has any genuine intentions of doing that.",2025-05-14T18:39:25
1kmmwcr,Inside Putin's mind - and how he plans to outsmart Trump,theipaper,7,2025-05-14T18:38:55,theipaper,2,"# Why Putin wants to carry on fighting

In Putin’s mind, says Bristow, his forces are winning on the battlefield. There is quite simply no reason in his mind to stop fighting now.

“In a [war of attrition](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/war-of-attrition-what-meaning-term-explained-what-happening-ukraine-russia-conflict-1529533?srsltid=AfmBOory57qKZ859uyRy1g7bkU0A5gyhCH5vcGRvZDVKle3l1fLND7sw&amp;ico=in-line_link), it’s about who loses first, not who wins.” If he can keep fighting for as long as possible, “Putin’s calculation, which I think is probably right, is that it’s Ukraine that loses first… Russia’s got a bigger economy, a much bigger population, and they can coerce the population in a way that Ukrainians can’t.

“Russia’s army has been seriously damaged. They’ve taken enormous losses and they take more every day. The country now runs on a war economy and that will damage Russia’s long-term prospects profoundly. But none of that changes anything in Putin’s head… In his own mind, all the costs are worth it.”

Short agrees that the Russian leader will believe his country can continue fighting “for quite some time to come. The threats of tougher [sanctions](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sanctions-against-russia?srsltid=AfmBOorlwWCT8HCdtiGS3scNV16bhi97igllVft4QzDXSnrYQdnUoGXc&amp;ico=in-line_link) probably won’t alter his calculations on that”.

As ever, Putin’s strategy all depends on “whether he thinks he can get away with it”, he says. And for the moment, he can.

His actions go beyond pragmatic considerations, however. It’s about his fundamental goals and ideology.

“There is absolutely no sign whatsoever that he’s changed any of his objectives in the war,” says Bristow. “He does not believe that Ukraine should exist. He thinks it’s part of the Russian empire.”

No deal allowing any form of Ukrainian independence will quell the enduring sense of “Russian imperialism and resentment at the end of the Cold War”, which drove Putin to invade in the first place. “There’s a clear sense of his personal destiny being now inseparable from Russia’s destiny, and this is something that just has to happen.”

Short agrees on this point. Putin still draws much of his strength from ultra-nationalists, he says. They might not have hungered for a war, especially such a long and deadly one, but they support its aims and will not accept a consolation prize, let alone defeat.

“Do not underestimate the extent to which so many Russians really feel that Ukraine is part of their history, their identity, their culture, their religion,” says the biographer. “I remember people 30 to 40 years ago in Moscow saying to me: ‘It’s inconceivable that Ukraine should ever be independent, it’s ours.’”",2025-05-14T18:39:42
1kmmwcr,Inside Putin's mind - and how he plans to outsmart Trump,theipaper,7,2025-05-14T18:38:55,theipaper,1,"This is why the Europeans have little faith that negotiations can work unless Russia is weakened.

“Anyone who believes that Putin will keep an agreement that he signs is a fool. It just isn’t going to happen,” says Bristow.

“In dealing with Putin, a ceasefire never ever means the ceasing of fire. What he’d seek to do is to play below the threshold of military action to his advantage: nibbling away at the principles, doing things that he can get away with without necessarily bringing the whole thing to collapse, eroding the position of the Ukrainians and eroding the position of the Americans and Europeans to support them.”

Pointing to what happened after the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Putin’s first partial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Bristow says: “You typically get a military provocation which doesn’t quite tip things back into outright warfare again, but incrementally improves Russia’s military and political position.”

And beyond a temporary truce, no supposedly permanent settlement with Putin could be genuinely trusted, argues Bristow. In fact, it is possible he may never agree to one. “In my view, there isn’t going to be a final settlement of this conflict while Putin is alive, which could be another decade or so… The idea that simply trading land will buy you peace in Ukraine – that’s not going to happen.”

# Concerns for the rest of Europe

Some Eastern European nations – especially Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which all suffered terribly within the Soviet empire – worry what Putin will do if he secures any kind of victory in Ukraine, or at least a face-saving escape. Despite now being Nato members, they believe the Russian leader would want to invade them next.

Short can understand those Baltic fears, after Putin has attacked one neighbour so “foolishly and stupidly”. Yet he believes the Russia president holds no such aspirations. “He’s not mad,” he explains. “I don’t see it happening in a million years. Attacking Nato directly is something that the Russians have been very careful not to do.”

He adds: “We’ve had all the European leaders and previously the Americans saying: ‘If we don’t stop him in Ukraine, then we’re going to be next.’ I really felt that was a very good way of winning popular support, of persuading British and American taxpayers they’ve got to fork out.”

Bristow firmly rejects this notion, insisting the dangers are real. “If he wins in Ukraine – by any definition – that is a direct and very serious threat to European and UK security… Russia would be the dominant military power in Europe.”",2025-05-14T18:40:06
1kmmwcr,Inside Putin's mind - and how he plans to outsmart Trump,theipaper,7,2025-05-14T18:38:55,theipaper,1,"Whether Putin would consider pushing further westwards by attacking the Baltics, or perhaps even Poland, partly depends on his mental state at the time, according to the former diplomat.

But it also revolves around how strong and united Nato remains in two or three years. Would he be willing to gamble that Trump will not abide by [Article Five of the treaty](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/article-5-nato-what-pact-explained-collective-defence-russia-ukraine-war-1484451?srsltid=AfmBOooMuPIAa3-CYtvfqtB8FKqW9rFvP33OZnlueKBoJMgoSv--mxV5&amp;ico=in-line_link), by supporting European allies militarily if they are attacked?#

He will also feel emboldened by the presence of [Xi Jinping](https://inews.co.uk/topic/xi-jinping?srsltid=AfmBOopa0dHFWq3GIsxLJT3TscIMvIFcA1s0xu85IzboLNIeQgBPV6SX&amp;ico=in-line_link) alongside him in Moscow last week to watch the [Victory Day military parade](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/moscow-victory-parade-pictures-how-far-russia-fallen-3681308?ico=in-line_link). That was a serious display of comradeship from the Chinese president.

“It’s clearly in Xi’s interest to have Russia as a wingman in the strategic competition with the US,” says Bristow. “My strong suspicion is that Xi is appalled at the disaster that Russia has wrought on itself here. But I don’t think there’s any prospect at all of peeling Russia and China apart. That’s total fantasy.”

Nevertheless, predicting Putin’s actions can be tricky when he is so insulated from the outside world. “Even if you’re a senior Russian official, you don’t on the whole get quality time with the man,” says Bristow. “He’s very isolated and hemmed around by a very tiny number of very close advisers.”

Those around him are “true believers” who would not dare challenge the leader, he adds. “This is not a system where telling the boss he’s wrong is life-enhancing.”",2025-05-14T18:40:25

And in a more inner political sense, Trump is waging war on his own people. First, by dividing them.

Initial negotiations have nothing to do with a ceasefire either. It is just about representatives talking directly to each other.

I thought direct talks with Russia is actually against the Ukrainian Constitution, but Zelensky or his representative will still be there after Trump told Zelensky to initiate talk to stop the bloodbath \[and that this was not about a ceasefire\]. Initially, Zelensky first wanted Russia to declare a 30 days ceasefire.

Starmer travelled by train with French President Emmanuel Macron and the new German chancellor Friedrich Merz, with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky joining them in Kyiv. 

The trip is designed to show support and solidarity with Ukraine after 20 world leaders joined [Victory Day celebrations in Russia this week.](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/moscow-victory-parade-pictures-how-far-russia-fallen-3681308?srsltid=AfmBOoqfW-iFLNKl7ze6_--ihKpnQGac-9lMX_2jcB0sDwCxSQfHqn7t&amp;ico=in-line_link)

But it has also acted as a strong display of unity with the US, after somewhat fractured relations since Donald Trump re-entered the White House in February. He had a public spat with the Ukrainian President in the Oval Office and has, until recently, appeared favourable towards Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin.

The US President is now firmly backing a push for a 30-day ceasefire from Monday so peace talks can begin and held a call with Starmer and the other European leaders on Saturday.

In a joint statement, the European group said they “reiterate our backing for President Trump’s calls for a peace deal” and that “alongside the US, we call on Russia to agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire”.

They threatened Russia with “massive” new sanctions if it failed to comply.

Finally, it seems, Europe and the US are pulling in the same direction over Ukraine. But will it be enough to pressure Putin into a deal?

# Trump cooling on Putin as relations with Europe thaw

Since retaking office, Trump has veered dramatically from Europe’s stance on the conflict, blaming Ukraine for starting the war, [temporarily withholding intelligence from Kyiv](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-wants-3-85bn-apology-zelensky-what-happens-3565161?ico=in-line_link) and threatening to pull military support, as well as [hinting that he would withdraw from the Nato military alliance](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/how-trump-100-days-make-world-more-volatile-3654650?srsltid=AfmBOor8PYCRoLCudi3I9smorbL9JwWa0B0K1KXmhxceKMHiV48RSO60&amp;ico=in-line_link) altogether.

But his relationship with Putin[ has cooled in recent weeks](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-mad-putin-ukraine-peace-talks-3614784?ico=in-line_link), with Trump making a series of public criticisms as he grows frustrated at the Kremlin’s unwillingness to end the war.

The Europeans say they have held productive calls with Trump in recent days and defence insiders say there is currently no indication that the US President is reducing his support for, or withdrawing from, Nato. He has also threatened fresh sanctions on Russia.

Dr Neil Melvin, director of international security at defence think tank Rusi, said rhetoric around the trip appeared to show a “realignment” away from Putin and towards Europe.

Melvin said that the European strategy following the [“disastrous meeting” between Trump and Ukraine’s President Zelensky in the Oval Office](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/three-astonishing-things-trump-said-to-zelensky-in-white-house-shouting-match-3560887?srsltid=AfmBOopHgSBHpRem-CGTdDlqYqlppuoTVKB6VfaqA2Aq_7fV2YQ0Mbzu&amp;ico=in-line_link) had been to get behind America’s approach and lavish praise on the White House, while trying to steer the terms of any agreement in Ukraine’s favour.

# America’s backing of Ukraine could pressure Putin

Despite the change in Trump’s position, a [ceasefire is by no means imminent](https://inews.co.uk/news/ukraine-war-end-maps-3654829?ico=in-line_link).

Russia has already indicated it will not consider the US’s proposed 30-day ceasefire unless the West halts arms supplies to Ukraine, which is intolerable to Kyiv’s allies.

The Kremlin is widely considered to be [stalling talks, with little incentive to bring the conflict to a close.](https://inews.co.uk/news/putin-trump-easter-deadline-delay-3601466?ico=in-line_link)

He believes that Putin is only appearing to entertain talks to win favour from Trump, who had pledged to end the war “on day one” of his presidency.

However, Melvin said that if the US throws its weight behind Ukraine again, it may help tip the balance in favour of Kyiv, and enable Zelensky to continue the war until Russia is exhausted.

However, Melvin said that if the US throws its weight behind Ukraine again, it may help tip the balance in favour of Kyiv, and enable Zelensky to continue the war until Russia is exhausted.

“We’ve already seen signs that United States is ready to start to resupply Ukraine with weapons, provided Ukraine buys them rather than being given them as a basis for loans or even gifts. There’s been talk that the United States may re- examine the sanctions on Russia,” Melvin said.

“The issue now is: will the United States actually swing behind Ukraine and use strategies to put pressure on Moscow to reach a peace deal, and to strengthen Ukraine? That will make a difference.”

Melvin said that Putin’s war machine may still have the upperhand but it is also “struggling” and they are making little progress on the battlefields.

“It’s costing a lot of people and equipment, and the Russian economy is starting to run out of the ability to sustain this. I think the longer this goes on, particularly into next year, things start to look much darker for Putin at that point.

“The dial may start to shift a little bit more towards pressure on Russia, the longer that this solidarity with Ukraine remains in place.”

This would impact Russia’s ability to fund its invasion and to recruit new soldiers with the promise of cash.

However, the White House has not indicated when – or if – these sanctions would be imposed, and Melvin said it could be more difficult than Trump would like.

“Some of the targets that have been, at least hypothetically, thought about have been countries like India, because they’ve been buying a lot of Russian oil at very cheap prices,” Melvin said.

“The problem is that it’s going to be a very difficult political message, because you’re not just sanctioning Russia. You’re going after countries who may not feel that this is really their fault; they’re just buying oil on world markets against the backdrop of an already very tough situation around this global tariff war that Trump started.

“I think that that instrument looks more complicated than perhaps the Trump administration initially thought it would be.”

Once that door is cracked it gives unbelievable power to states with more cows than citizens that also happen to have extremist Republican leadership. As far as I know, the vote isn’t weighted by actual citizens in each state, just by state. Part of that was because the 18th century people who wrote the rules didn’t think we’d be stupid enough not to change the rules down the road and part of it was because the 18th century slave owners wanted to rat fuck the power of larger northern states. And then we landed at the Civl war, abandoned reconstruction and let a Confederate insurgency get into our governmental system where it’s festered ever since. A constitutional convention would in effect create a neo-confederate theocracy in America and I don’t think I have to spell out how awful that would be.",2025-05-06T00:35:59

Therapy can help with the life skills part.  There are ABA providers for those who can afford it. Group homes are prohibitively expensive. So I could see how families without the finances could maybe be swayed to putting their autistic loved ones into ""wellness camps"" and tell themselves that it will help them.

The dust bowl was a blight in the central US (like Ok &amp; KS) whereas a majority of the Japanese who were interred had homes/property on the west coast that was stolen.

Which does have negative consequences for us, but on the other hand... I was *freaking out* when Trump first won and when all this started. Now? Now I'm just pissed off. I feel like, whatever they're gonna do, can they just go ahead and do it? What's all this waiting around for? I don't think ICE would come for me in the first place, but I definitely keep my eyes open and my head on a swivel, and I do not plan to go peacefully. I'm sure people are buying guns and planning. In other words, you can't maintain that atmosphere of fear because people return to their baseline, and when that happens, they're just emboldened.


Most importantly, he's already lost a lot of Republican support, which is *not good* for him. Because the military and police are not sufficient to take over a country as big as the US; he needs unofficial militias if he wants to do that, and, sure, he might get *some people,* but... I mean, especially if everyone else is becoming more armed, a lot of these people are cowards. And this is all assuming the military will do it, which is far from guaranteed: Trump's done plenty to piss them off, too. It's not an either/or, either: they might follow deployment orders but then just stand around like what happened recently in South Korea.


Whatever happens, I don't see it ending well for Trump. I'm not even worried about him anymore; the long-term problem is gonna be a legitimacy crisis. Like, someone's gonna step up and make a whole bunch of reforms, but we all just saw that it's made up.",2025-05-05T17:00:32

I think that’s pretty much what’s going on though. Sure, Trump may blurt out that he wants to be dictator and so on, but he’ll always just turn around and say that he was joking, and that you’re actually killing democracy by not letting him run for a third term. 

&gt;My main point is that I think the people as a whole still have some emotional tie to democracy

I think this is mostly a farce, honestly. I don’t think the general public at any point in history in any country has ever particularly cared for abstract ideals like “democracy”, even if they claim to. Sure, liberal intellectuals and party members might care, but all the average person really cares about is stability and putting food on the table. And sadly, actually accomplishing that isn’t necessary for a dictator to seize power. All he needs to do is promise that. That being said, id anything would be the biggest threat to Trump’s power, I think it would be that, rather than his anti-democratic actions.

Everyone should start preparing for the worst case scenario and take steps to start resisting a future authoritarian regime (not to sound accusatory towards the commenter, just hijacking the top comment for visibility).

Here’s some ideas of things you can do in the short term if you’re unsure of what to do.

- Join a mutual aid group. You can Google “mutual aid groups near me” or something like that. Start offering help with whatever you’re able to in order to start building a support network.
- Join a protest, but more importantly make at least one connection with someone there (the more the merrier though). Similar to the mutual aid group, you want to start building a network of like minded individuals if shit starts getting more serious.
- Learn a skill. First aid, sewing clothes, DIY home repair, etc. Learn and practice something that will be useful to a group if essential services become unavailable.
- Get informed. Read books (and watch videos too, but I’d challenge you to stick to mediums that can’t be shut off or easily controlled) about how to resist an authoritarian regime. “On Tyranny” by Timothy Snyder is an easy to read and well structured book that also gives a lot of other sources you can refer to after you’re done., but just get yourself as informed as possible while hopefully weaning yourself from relying on the internet for information.
- This one’s a bit controversial, but if you’re not opposed to arming yourself, start doing so and start stockpiling ammunition. Hit the practice range regularly and train. There’s a large community of liberal gun owners out there, but if you can’t find any, just train at the conservative places. Most places will generally leave to your own devices as long as you’re not actively starting trouble.",2025-05-05T15:42:40

Even checks and balances is just a fancy gentlemen's agreement to self-regulate.

Trump.

&gt;Who was the attorney general?

Bill Barr.

&gt;Jan 6: trump attempted a coup where his supporters stormed the capital. People died.

No shit.

&gt;they stormed the capital because ""rigged elections"" allowed Biden to win.

No, they stormed the capitol because they were told to, and because political agitators had a plan to use the outrage to drum up a violent act and cause a coup.

&gt;Biden chose merrick fucking garland for attorney general to try and appease to the far right and appear ""neutral""

Biden chose Merrick Garland as his AG because he's who Obama had nominated for the Supreme Court, and Biden wanted to restore independence to the DOJ, not because he ""wanted to appease to the far right"".

&gt;For an attempted coup, it took OVER 4 fucking years and NOTHING happened to trump. He got off Scott free for what he did. Dems had the chance for justice but threw it away.

What the revisionist fuck are you talking about?! Two years of investigation and trial, only for the case to be landed in a Trump-appointed Judge's court who stonewalled the prosecution, continually ruled in Trump's favor, and then eventually was brought to the supreme court ***where a GOP CONTROLLED SUPREME COURT RULED TRUMP WAS IMMUNE.***

I get your anger - really, I do - but you're completely fooling yourself if you're blaming the Democrats for not doing something when the entire effort was undermined every step of the way by Republicans and their appointees.

&gt;But let's talk about dems now. Are they united now under one goal to stop trump?

Yes.

&gt;They can't even vote along party lines against his cabinet picks.

What the fuck good would that do? Last time he just had ""acting"" picks and slipped the confirmation process altogether. You cannot be so naive as to think that Democrats have any real power here. Not after we lived through his first term. Lmfao.

You're directing your anger at the wrong group of people. Shitting on Democrats when the GOP does something they have no power to stop is not going to stop the GOP. 100% of your anger needs to be focused and transfixed on the GOP and their actions if you want this shit to end.",2025-05-05T13:46:29

It started a long time before that. Latest you could really say it started was when the GOP started using the Southern strategy of courting the white racist vote. It was only a matter of time before white supremacists and the religious right would take over the party.",2025-05-05T14:21:04

So now we know, a single party can destroy the country... whats stopping a democrat version of Trump in the future?

You will say ""the voters"".... But that didnt stop Trump. So, I am going to disagree.

We need to make candidates be about who they are, and what they actually want to do, rather than which party they are... Painting The other party as the devil, and always rejecting EVERYTHING the other party does or wants to do... thats not helping any of us. We are moving too fucking slowly. The people that vote, we dont even get anything we fucking want.

Its all because of the party system. It should be truly illegal, and an immediate impeachment for someone to be a part of a party. Anyone that is part of any group in government? Kick them out.

If I was the dictator for a day, I would make that the law.

Thats how this person wants government and society to work?

&amp;nbsp;

I have NOTHING against the democratic party.

What I have a problem about is people voting for candidates entirely based on their party, and not who they are, or what they actually want to accomplish.

The party system creates this problem, because we vote for someone based on party. What this does? It knocks out people that would otherwise win an election, like Bernie Sanders, and installs people that we didnt want, like Hillary Clinton, and in the end? Trump wins.

Bush II pulled some seriously shady shit, and ignored the will of the electorate, or at least openly and blatantly manipulated it. The ""we create reality"" speech was chilling at the time.

And then Reagan pretty much got away with whatever he wanted to get away with; as long as his folksy charm held out he was pretty much untouchable. Then Nixon, who is unique in having seen consequences. Then if you are looking for bad behavior committed in the US directed at citizens, you do have to go back aways, but if you are looking for criminality on the world stage, it's pretty blatant and common, though we rarely talk about it in the US. Something like 64 governments overthrown on US orders after WWII...and then of course we had a hand in a lot of rotten stuff between the wars, and before WWI there was a decided and openly talked about shift to imperialism, similar to what we had at the last election. The more you look the more you find. 

Anyway, if the US is sliding toward fascism and isolated nationalism, and the world is shifting toward more liberal governments to distance itself, it is possible to see a coherent long-term trend where all this was inevitable, and that it might be a very good thing that the veil is lifted and the world is waking up. Of course that's not the narrative you get in school, but the main reason it seems so unprecedented is how firmly the normal ""we're the good guys"" narrative is embedded in our psyches.

And I'd add on edit - while most of the perpetrators on the list are GOP, and there was often strong resistance from the other side of the aisle, but almost never were heinous actions reversed when the opposition got back in. One example one of my history professors gave was about one of the worst things the US government ever did - the Indian Displacement Act, under Andrew Jackson (Trump's favorite president), which led to the Trail of Tears and all that. The Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, but Jackson didn't give a shit, and it all went forward anyway. Opposing parties made a big fuss and outcry, but when Jackson was out and they were in they fixed nothing.",2025-05-05T16:31:31

If so, this would be a refreshing change in direction.  Otherwise it's just more of the same BS. 

From day one, there have only been two outcomes for this conflict.  The crux issue is Putin's ambition to restore the Russian/Soviet empire to former greatness.  Either that dream gets crushed or it doesn't.    
  
Crushing it requires a resounding Russian defeat (possibly followed by a short walk out a high window) that resonates in Russian society for generations.  Not crushing it, our current path, means endless wars in Europe.  You can't give a bully what he wants and expect him to not ask for more.  Churchill understood this.  Reagan understood it.  Trump?  He admires Putin's style.   
  
With only a bit of Reagan-like pressure Trump could tip the balance and go down in history as a great leader. I suspect the old-guard Reagan worshipers are floating that idea in hopes of salvaging something.  They are rightly wondering why we can't have greatness instead of this diaper-baby golf capitulation.

Trump's philosophy about life in general and foreign policy in particular is informed by his positive attitudes toward bullying.  

Might makes right.  Trump's idea of a Ukraine peace agreement is Ukraine's capitulation. 

Putin is a winner.  Therefore, he deserves to win.

Zelensky is a loser.  Therefore, he should kiss the ring and surrender.

We saw this when Zelensky met with Trump and Vance.  Trump was utterly shocked that Zelensky wouldn't take a beating and thank him for it.  

Under the same circumstances, Trump would have surrendered in a heartbeat.  Trump starts yelling at Zelensky as this is slipping away right in front of him.  Why isn't Zelensky taking an offer that he can't refuse?

There are two things that could change Trump's position: If he believes that Ukraine is winning, or if he comes to believe that Putin is not his friend, after all.  Policy makers should manage Trump accordingly.",2025-04-29T13:48:39

It’s not up for reasonable debate what happened, at least on 2 separate occasions. Has Hegsteth come out and admitted to it? Or anyone else?

But it’s an obvious lie. It’s the lie that we all expect, and the lie they knew they were gonna say. They just continue labeling dems as evil and twist and suddenly it’s anyone’s fault but the people who actually did it.

There is mountains of evidence showing the very odd and continuously emboldened behavior trump and his admin gives toward Putin.

He has every reason to lie about it. You know the last time he didn’t lie about it? The very first time when he said “I’m fucked, this is the end of my presidency.” But I guess that’s prob just made up quote too yea?",2025-04-28T12:10:11

Yeah, that already happened. 

Say, why do you suppose Trump is now refusing to even *sell* patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine even though Zelensky is offering 50 billion in cash for them?
These defense systems could have saved dozens to hundreds of innocent lives from Russia deliberately striking civilian targets.

The reason they’re able to get away with it is that the system was designed around people operating in good faith. The people voted for trump, and that’s why he is office. The population could vote in a literal convicted murderer, and there are no mechanisms to prevent it. There is of course impeachment, but we also saw how wiping your ass with peaceful transition of power doesn’t get you kicked out because the ones who decided his faith were ALSO acting in bad faith. I mean cmon why even say it was a peaceful protest? There’s another obvious lie that they just expect their base to eat up while pissing off the entire world.

And then what happened? Nothing. Because rules and laws don’t matter when the people who are supposed to uphold them don’t. Evidence for everything they do doesn’t matter when trump goes on tv and says the opposite and then Fox runs with it while also making sure you understand that everything dems say is made up and trying to hurt you and your dear leader.

Zelensky needs to tickle Trump's balls as much as he can. And yes, I hate that that's the case, but Putin has been doing so for years. Let the ego go and play politics.",2025-04-28T02:22:48

Trump has also been a Russophile for decades and thinks of Putin as his friend.

So he is heavily invested emotionally in favoring Russia, as he sees Putin as a great success and wishes to be like him.

There are only two things that are going to change Trump's mind about Ukraine and Putin:

\- He comes to believe that Putin is a loser

\- He starts to think that Putin is not his friend

There is a slight chance that Trump had a sort of epiphany by having his ego bruised.  Zelensky was applauded at the Pope's funeral, while he was not, which makes him feel inadequate.  Meanwhile, Russian state media is openly mocking Trump for being a dupe.

Trump has a track record of dumping his friends.  That's especially true if he comes to see them as losers.",2025-04-27T23:47:34

One time the mod did not understand I was actually pro immigrant - I come from an immigrant family - he didn't grasp the comparison I was making and accused me of hate, sigh. This upset me so much that I tried to explain to him what I said was pro immigrant - but he threatened me with a permanent ban if I replied back, so I had to shut up. 

This last time it was because I asked about the comment being deleted. There's a button to click , so I clicked and asked why and was told it was an automated delete , and I was going to be banned for the week.

No matter what deal I make with respect to Russia/Ukraine, no matter how good it is, even if it's the greatest deal ever made, The Failing New York Times will speak BADLY of it. Liddle' Peter Baker, the very biased and untalented writer for The Times, followed his Editor's demands and wrote that Ukraine should get back territory, including, I suppose, Crimea, and other ridiculous requests, in order to stop the killing that is worse than anything since World War II. Why doesn't this lightweight reporter say that it was Obama who made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired. It was also Liddle' Peter who wrote an absolutely fawning, yet terribly written Biography, on Obama. It was a JOKE! Did Baker ever criticize the Obama Crimea Giveaway? NO, not once, only TRUMP, and I've had nothing to do with this stupid war, other than early on, when I gave Ukraine Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets. This is Sleepy Joe Biden's War, not mine. It was a loser from day one, and should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened if I were President at the time. I'm just trying to clean up the mess that was left to me by Obama and Biden, and what a mess it is. With all of that being said, there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ""Banking"" or ""Secondary Sanctions?"" Too many people are dying!!!",2025-04-26T19:12:46

There is little doubt that the U.S. will withdraw its support for Ukraine at some point with only the degree of withdrawal to be determined.

I reached out to my friend last night in Kyiv and this is the message I got back. “Hi ******. I need to share something... I’m okay for now, but Kyiv is under a massive combined attack tonight—suicide drones, ballistic and cruise missiles.

We’re trying to sleep, but my daughter and I are dressed and staying in the hallway, with our emergency backpack by the door — water and documents inside. In a district far from us, a 3-year-old child was injured… People are trapped under rubble… There’s no end to this suffering”. 

She shared with me, her location and her cell number which I didn’t actually have at the time. I think she wanted someone from the outside to know where she was.   She’s never showed that information with me before so I knew it was bad last night.

but I'll go into detail since you don't think its obvious enough. Russia has a population many times higher, and can go for way longer. Russia also has weaponry superiority. although Ukraine has brave and and capable soldiers that won't go forever, we already have Ukrainians being kidnapped and forced to join the war, they lack the manpower. it is a race against time and the more time passes the more territory Ukraine will and is already losing. Ukraine right now is like a hospitalized patient that is still alive because there are machines hooked to them (the us). the only reason Ukraine has not been totally occupied is because of the external help.

that external help is going away, the USA doesn't want to keep funding Ukraine, so time is of the essence for Ukraine and why a peace deal is the way to go. this is without mentioning the most important thing, the killing stops.",2025-04-24T22:26:09

But a peace deal on its own, at least ones that are being discussed are not likely to be accepted or pan out. The way I see it here are my thoughts on the matter. 

Peace deal, current territorial gains kept, no additional arms or security guarantee: This gives both sides time to recover and re-arm. This does however greatly favour Russia as while their quality of arms may not be equal to the quality that Ukraine has been getting, even with Europe still supplying Ukraine though not as a whole bloc, Russia will likely still have the industry to re-arm at a faster rate especially if they continue receiving arms from China and North Korea. In addition to this, Putin has repeatedly shown that he is willing to ignore agreed upon treaties such as the Minsk agreement by using a combination of propaganda, misinformation and false flag operations. See, literally any other conflict Russia has started since the cold war. Even if US companies set up mining operations they will likely completely bypass these areas or again use false flags and blame Ukraine for any damage/casualties. 

Any other peace deal: Russia will never accept a deal which provides Ukraine with security guarantees from the EU/NATO/US. Nor will either side likely accept loss of territory. 

My opinion on the best option: Personally, and I should note I have 0 background in economics or geopolitics, I think the best path to peace is further sanctioning Russia and implementing Tariffs (I know, I know) or sanctions on nations supporting or bypassing sanctions on Russia. This would be done over time to give time to the nations to find other sources for supply like oil. 

Negotiate with nations to further undercut Russian prices on resources like oil and gas prior to the above. Lastly, arm Ukraine to the teeth, Supply then with modern arms without restrictions. Russia has stated previously that redlines would lead to military actions on these countries who supplied arms such as f16s, tracks, etc but these have always resulted in nothing. As a safety barrier this can also be done incrementally though it must be at a much faster pace than it is currently. Especially for European nations as it is in their great interest as Russia has historically always been the biggest threat and continues to be. It should also be noted that this can have positive effects for these nations as they get better data on their arms usefulness as well as boosts their economy in the replacement and improvements on these arms.

*You* are ignoring the fact that giving in to Putin's demands, or 'agreeing to a peace deal now', means that 2 million more homes need to be surrendered to Russia and Ukraine needs to destroy its own military and can't accept any military aid, because *that* are Putin's demands. Obviously, this would make it very easy for Putin to invade again a few years later (or perhaps even a few weeks), destroy more and take more.

You are also ignoring the fact that Russia has held Ukraine for centuries as a colony, and attempted to gradually genocide it away in the process of Russification in order to keep the land, through things like the Holodomor and deportations and by forbidding the Ukrainian language and culture.

The Ukrainian language is now forbidden again in the occupied territories, people and children are being deported to Russia proper, Ukrainian 18 year olds are being recruited by the Russian army to fight against Ukraine, people who resist are arrested and possibly tortured and Russians are encouraged to cheaply buy the houses left behind by refugees.

Do you not care about all of this? And do you also not care that Russia will likely just invade further if the Ukrainian government agrees to a 'peace' now?

How can you claim to argue for the Ukrainian population if you don't know or care about the genocidal acts of Russia against them? And how can you claim to know better than the Ukrainians while you don't even seem to know Putin's demands for this 'peace' you are arguing so strongly for?",2025-04-25T10:47:29

But let’s back up a bit. Do the people in those territories want that? Will Russia just be emboldened to come back for more again and again?

Ukraine wants their sovereignty. The people even in Donetsk and Luhansk want to remain Ukrainian and do not support annexation. There’s even mixed feelings in Crimea in spite of the referendum widely considered suspect claiming to show otherwise. How about what they want?

Trump isn’t “the only person trying to end the war.” He started arrogantly saying he’d stop this on day 1 and today he’s begging “please stop.” The one person who has the ability to stop it is the one who started this madness.

And to be honest Trump who normally has a pretty short attention span and even shorter ability to focus on political issues has spent a surprisingly large amount of time on the issue. Granted most of it has been time spent making the issue worse because he's a spiteful idiot who still wants to make the Ukraine President pay for his role in Trumps impeachment, and for making him look bad. 

But all that aside I do believe he actually does want to be the person to solve this issue. Sadly, he's also not equipped to do it.

And thieves run in gangs. Putin is genuinely popular, war leaders usually are (Bush's ratings went up when he invaded Iraq too) and he also has the reputation of saving Russia from the collapse of the Yeltsin years... but even without that, his real political power is his connections with organised crime, and corrupt state power that acts like criminals. And post-Communism, there are *alot* of those. Not old people, but violent, very young, very modern people.

Donald Trump has some experience dealing with the American Mafia, with casinos and property, but he's a complete moron. And elected *because* of a huge media campaign to support mediocity and hateful morons. Putin rose to the top of a cut-throat criminal society that eats anyone without pure animal cunning alive. Putin *might* be losing it, certainly Russia experts (which *isn't* Reddit) have noted his politics have changed, but he has to at least be equal to the criminals around him, or they'd have knocked him off. And Putin is still there.  And the Russian economy is still growing (Reddit, once more, is wrong about even basic facts); so the money is still flowing to the gangs around him. So they're happy.

I was thinking of the idiots are taking over

It's not the right time to be sober

Now, the idiots have taken over

Spreading like a social cancer, is there an answer?

Mensa membership conceding

Tell me why and how are all the stupid people breeding?

Watson, it's really elementary

Industrial revolution

Has flipped the bitch on evolution

The benevolent and wise are being thwarted, ostracized

What a bummer

The world keeps getting dumber

Insensitivity is standard

And faith is being fancied over reason

Darwin's rolling over in his coffin

The fittest are surviving much less often

Now, everything seems to be reversing, and it's worsening

Someone flopped a steamer in the gene pool

Now, angry mob mentality is no longer the exception, it's the rule

And I'm startin' to feel a lot like Charlton Heston

Stranded on a primate planet

Apes and orangutans that ran it to the ground

With generals and the armies that obeyed them

Followers following fables

Philosophies that enable them to rule without regard

There's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated

Political scientists get the same one vote as some Arkansas inbred

Majority rule, don't work in mental institutions

Sometimes, the smallest softest voice carries the grand biggest solutions

What are we left with?

A nation of god-fearing pregnant nationalists

Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland

Pass on traditions

How to get ahead religions

And prosperity via simpleton culture (ah-)

How is someone this incompetent allowed to be in power? If we make it through this bullshit we need some serious reform on how this government functions and who is considered eligible to be president.

Yet. 

This is such a cringe to see him show such weakness on the world stage. To see him roll over on his belly and just piss himself like this.

I am an American, and in the 10 or so years of witnessing the political life of Donald Trump, I have felt many emotions. Many emotions.

But goddamn. I actually feel empathy *for the first time* at just how out of his depth he really is. . . I just want to take him by the hand and walk him into a first class staff of psychologists and just let him talk it out for however many days and weeks it takes. They can work in shifts, listening and nodding until he just gets tuckered out. Maybe crying. Tissues. Screams. 

And when he finally is out of words, I’ll give him a hug, take him by the hand again, and let him go back to Queens to visit his childhood room. And as he sits there, too cringed out to breathe and with some understanding of **what he has added to this world**, and that the idea of *making amends* seems frankly . . . too out of reach, I’ll lock the door, leave him with his thoughts, his regrets, his emotions, and a loaded revolver.

Things such as arming Ukraine, to raise Russian losses, and slow, if not reverse, the Russian army advance.",2025-04-24T15:51:38

&gt;North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer made waves Wednesday when he insisted that Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Zelenskyy, were both committed to ""peace"" in an appearance on CNN.

Putin is destroying all that the USA used to stand for.  Destroying any faith left in the justice system.  Pitting American against American.  Destroying decades old alliances and friendships.  Isolating and destroying what was once a well respected nation.

He's burning your vaunted constitution as you look on.

And turning your country into a laughing stock.

It would cede control over its foreign policy by promising never to join NATO—an ironic Russian demand, given how starkly Putin’s invasion has reminded the world why alliances such as NATO must continue to exist. But NATO membership is a distant issue compared to the immediate problem: If Kyiv agrees to Trump’s proposal, whatever is left of the Ukrainian state will soon be an easy target for the Kremlin.  Once the Russian economy recovers and Russia’s forces catch their breath, Putin will finish the job of conquering Ukraine with even greater vengeance and violence. Time and space are on Moscow’s side, and Trump intends to give Putin plenty of both”

Edited to add that the ammo dump is very near Moscow and they pulled this off during daylight hours.  This has the added bonus that people living around Moscow thought they were safe and *surprise*.  Plus this takes a lot of ammo off the board, making it harder for Putin to mount new assaults.

This is not a rhetorical question. Ukraine is losing soldiers daily perhaps at a much lower rate than Russia but still losing. Do you think Ukraine (even with Western arms) will endure a street by street battle in the cities Russia has captured? There is almost zero chance that any European or US army will actively engage Russia in Ukraine.

&gt;The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.

&gt;The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.

&gt;They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944.

These people don't have to experience living in Ukraine and having their lives in danger, so they don't care about the people who ARE living in Ukraine. It's their ""not my problem"" attitude.

They're attacking our election systems, installing cronies at the highest levels of government, deporting legal immigrants, making it harder for women to vote, making it impossible for trans people to get a passport, dismantling LGBT protections, destroying our social safety net, setting up extrajudicial death camps, crashing the economy, and destabilizing the U.S dollar. 

I don't have a car to get to protests near me, I live in a rural area so there's no public transportation, I've been without work for three months, and I think that my only real option is to leave the U.S and claim asylum in a sympathetic country before the borders are closed. 

They're already working on closing off the U.S/Mexico border. I wonder how long before they do the same to the Canadian border and then air travel? 

Also Trump is planning on invoking the Insurrection Act on April 20th. The order was signed on January 20th, you should definitely give it a read.

But that is a dubious way to place the blame on the victim rather than the aggressor, just like in Ukraine. People in democratic states tend to want to defend themselves against invasions from dictatorships. It cost the Finns in 1939 and it costs the Ukrainians today.",2025-04-15T04:43:32

*On Friday, Trump said in a post on Truth Social: ""Russia has to get moving. Too many people (are) DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war - A war that should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!""*

*Putin has said he is ready in principle to agree to a full ceasefire, while emphasizing that crucial implementation details remain unresolved and what he describes as the war's root causes have yet to be addressed.*

To provide some more context for these peace talks, consider this. Putin **says** to be ready in principle for a ceasefire. He **shows** himself to be ready in practice for killing civilians with ballistic missile strikes. Less than 48 hours after Steve Witkoff held talks with Putin.

*Two ballistic missiles struck the heart of the city at around 10:15 a.m. as people gathered to celebrate Palm Sunday, according to officials. Videos posted from the scene on official channels showed bodies on the ground amid debris and smoke around central Sumy.*",2025-04-13T10:51:13

Most voters are not knowledgeable of or engaged by policy.  They will like a politician for one or two reasons, then take most of the rest of their views from the party and politician who have signalled their approval.

Reagan ran on low tax rates, American power and Dixie pride, offering platitudes to right-wing populists and Christian nationalists while claiming to be better with economics than the Democrats.

Trump has done exactly the same thing.  The details are very different, but the message is basically the same.

The GOP of 1985 didn't really care about Russia.  They took the side of their leader.

The GOP of 2025 doesn't really care about Russia.  They have taken the side of their leader.

If Trump decides to switch gears and start hating Vladimir Putin, most of the party will follow him.

While Trump played in Epstein's child rape empire, and ran his own child pageants... he traveled to Russia, where ""something happened"" and suddenly he became politically active, seemingly following someone else's playbook.

Given the 90% certainty that any given new pedophile found is a Republican... it's quite understandable that the Kompromat goes pretty deep in GOP circles.

They didn't like the decolonization that came with communism. This is the same group of people who overthrew dozens of elected governments in Central and South America because they were ""communists"" and installed mass murdering fascists in order to secure slave labor for fruit plantations. 

It was never about Russia. It was about wanting control over the world and Russia just happened to be opposed to this due to their own economic needs and internal dogma. Now that Russia is aggressively capitalist, it was furtile ground for buying cheap resources and selling expensive finished goods as long as you passed a buck or two uptop for the mob bosses in charge.

I now believe that supporting Ukraine is America First.  
  
Politics goes out the window when you see the atrocities at the hands of the Russians—  
that is just pure evil.  
  
I was on the ground.  
I walked through the ruins of churches,  
spoke to pastors whose congregations were scattered or killed,  
and saw the white bandanas—meant to identify civilians—  
used to tie the hands of elderly women before they were executed.  
  
I stood in a church-turned-memorial in BHA,  
where they celebrate liberation while surrounded by images of death.  
  
I heard about the 20,000 children kidnapped and deported to Russia,  
with over a million more unaccounted for.  
  
No one paid me to go to Ukraine.  
I bought my own ticket,  
and what I saw broke me.  
  
This is bigger than left or right, Republican or Democrat.  
This is about defending the innocent,  
defending faith,  
and standing up to evil.  
  
Ukraine is not just a place on a map—  
it’s people.  
And they are crying out for help.  
  
Not for money—  
but for peace,

I do always wonder why fake Christians claim to be believers when they’d get voted in whether they believed or not these days, but maybe there really is some part of them deep inside that believes. Trump is also very easily swayed from one side to the other, which is why he thinks he’s good at deal making - he does something atrocious, gets a shitty return on it as a compromise offer, then accepts it and thinks he’s done something amazing.

I saw multiple signs advertising psychic readings in public. I was born last century, and until literally this year, I'd *thought* psychics as a profession had died out the century before that in the 1800s. 

I'd never seen one before so I'd just assumed that the idea of psychics existing as an actual profession in modern times was entirely made up for TV, which now that I check that is apparently deeply untrue, I mean, a [Vogue author wrote last year](https://www.vogue.com/article/why-do-people-become-addicted-to-psychics): ""**Most people I know** have at one point in their lives gone to see a psychic, astrologer, tea leaf reader, or medium.""

So if this person, in 2025, has a social network in which the majority of people have paid money to have someone make specific predictions about their futures on the basis of storytelling about chance events, I think it really only stands to reason that a President might have one too.

I think the weirder part is that he would want a pastor at all. He could have that every Sunday in a church, but he never goes there. So for Trump, the reason he picks a pastor without following through is probably because it's the easiest way to make a show of it without actually doing anything, although obviously that doesn't really address what you're saying; even if Trump's not one of them, for a lot of people in the modern world, spirituality *is* more than just for show.",2025-04-11T00:20:26

1jtm7cp,What to Expect When You’re Expecting an Oligarchy | Putin’s Russia shows what happens when billionaire businessmen choose to back a strongman,Hrmbee,92,2025-04-07T14:12:11,Hrmbee,12,"Interesting portions of this analytical piece:

&gt;The surface rationale is that megabusiness leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Marc Andreessen are safeguarding their companies and their shareholders’ interests. The underlying explanation is that America is being reborn as an oligarchy.
&gt;
&gt;This new class—with Trump megadonor Elon Musk as its self-appointed tribune—has thrown its support behind a libertarian economic agenda that maximizes private power and minimizes public accountability. Whether the billionaires’ alignment with Trump and Musk is merely pragmatic or sincerely ideological, they stand to gain from the new administration’s crash program of dismantling government and regulatory agencies. For Trump, allying with such concentrated economic power helps him consolidate political control, at the expense of democracy. This fusion of money and power is nothing new. I saw something similar take shape in my native Russia. But three decades later, the Russian oligarchs’ bargain has ended up with only one true beneficiary: Vladimir Putin.
&gt;
&gt;America’s billionaires should take note. When extreme wealth combines forces with extreme power, the former can profit enormously for a time. As in Russia, the benefits of the executive’s policies are likely to flow upward: Super-wealthy Americans will enjoy tax breaks and deregulation for their businesses, while the poor will face rising prices, shrinking services, and reduced opportunity. But America’s tech oligarchs may discover sooner rather than later that, by undermining democratic governance, they are empowering an authoritarian president who can pick them off one by one—just as Putin did with the oligarchs who helped cement his rule.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;An authoritarian oligarchy is not a pleasant place to live in. Ask my 88-year-old aunt, who was hit by a car in a provincial Russian town some years ago and can no longer leave her apartment because of the long-term injuries she sustained. After the case was investigated, she was pressured to withdraw her testimony because the driver was the son of a local official. That is how Putin’s “power vertical,” as Russian political parlance refers to his highly centralized, top-down authority, reaches into the lives of the little people. The oligarchy’s erosion of the rule of law trickles down, corroding public trust and ultimately leaving everyone—elites and ordinary citizens alike—at the mercy of arbitrary absolutism. The billionaire class now rallying behind Trump would do well to consider the implications of such a partnership.
&gt;
&gt;For now, America still has a functioning electoral system, democratic institutions that have endured for centuries rather than decades, and a diverse, vibrant civil society. It also holds a vision of itself, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, in which everyone has the right to pursue a fulfilling and self-determined life. But as Putin showed, constitutions can be amended or worked around; Trump is already musing about a third term. To follow Russia’s cynical path—whereby an all-powerful ruler feeds the masses false promises of greatness and keeps the oligarchs in line with favors and threats—would be to lose sight of that vision.

If the rule of law doesn't apply fairly to all, and instead is applied selectively to a few, then the corruption that this engenders will affect every aspect of society at every level. The public should be aware of these dangers, and push back against these changes to societal and government norms, but to be able to do that effectively they would first need to understand what is at stake here. There is still the ability for some agency by the American public, but this too is not guaranteed under the current regime.

Putin even sent a portrait of Trump back to Trump with this guy. It’s sad. These people are useful idiots. It honestly looks like useful idiots all the way down, with Putin on top. 

Ok, found the story. The envoy is Witkoff. From the article:

&gt; Putin “told me a story… about how when the president was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the president,” Witkoff said.

&gt;“Not because… he could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend.”

Useful idiots through and through.

Trump, Vance, Musk, Hegseth, Witkoff etc have made it quite clear how they see the democracy vs dictatorship thing. The European democracies are repeatedly said to be very evil and raping USA since time immemorial, while Putin, Kim and Orban are great guys and the most repected leaders, treated with reverence, as compared to the treatment of Frederiksen, Zelensky and Trudeau. 

Maybe these guys just really, really want war against Europe, and see Greenland as a comfortable start. It wouldn't cost much in terms of effort or deaths, and give green light to the Molotov-Ribbentrop 2 they aim for, where Putin gets Ukraine and the Baltic States etc in return. This may well be the actual agenda behind the USA-Russia peace talks.

As for Trump being ruled by Putin, it could just be that they have exactly the same politicial opinions. It does remind very much of the world in 1939. Then it was Stalin and Hitler that shared the same distaste for democracies, and had the same will to annex democratic neighbours as Trump and Putin have today. Stalin really liked Hitler the same way Trump really likes Putin. But Hitler had just as little respect for Stalin as Putin has for Trump. In that respect I think Trump will be disappointed long term no matter how much he gives to Putin, he will get very little in return.",2025-04-04T11:36:20

”Now added to this comes a very important element that some people have known, and that's Stalin had a liking for Hitler. Stalin greatly admired Hitler”

[https://www.npr.org/transcripts/5366663](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/5366663)

Hitler may have talked a lot about bolshevism, but he also gave Stalin the impression of being a man very much like himself. Both were mainly interested in power, and Stalin had no interest in the equal communism he talked about, he only wanted dictatorship. To which extent he thought Hitler was any different is unclear. Stalin said something along the line that now they had to make their propaganda guys come up with some new spin on stuff, after they had signed the pact.

At least they did have some admiration for each other, in that they basically wanted the same thing and despised weakness and democracies. Then one may certainly debate if Lukacs is exaggerating.",2025-04-04T16:24:40

So I said, ‘Let me ask you a question, and the guy who makes boats in South Carolina said, ‘Nobody ever asked this question,’ and it must be because of MIT, my relationship to MIT —very smart. He goes, I say, ‘What would happen if the boat sank from its weight? And you’re in the boat and you have this tremendously powerful battery and the battery is now underwater and there’s a penguin that’s approximately 10 yards over there?’*

*By the way, a lot of penguin attacks lately, do you notice that, a lot of penguins?” he asked. “I watched some guys justifying it today. ‘Well, they weren’t really emperors, but they are very big and very angry. But they misunderstood what who she was.’ These people are crazy. He said there’s no problem with emperor penguins. ‘They just didn’t really understand a young woman swimming now. And it’s not an empire’ It really got decimated and other people do a lot of penguin attacks.* 

*So I said, so there’s an emperor penguin 10 yards away from the boat, 10 yards or here, do I get electrocuted if the boat is sinking? Water goes over the battery, the boat is sinking. Do I stay on top of the boat and get electrocuted, or do I jump over by the penguin and not get electrocuted? Because I will tell you, he didn’t know the answer. He said, ‘You know, nobody’s ever asked me that question.” I said, ‘I think it’s a good question.’ I think there’s a lot of electric current coming through that water. But you know what I’d do if there was a penguin or you get electrocuted, I’ll take electrocution every single time. I’m not getting near the penguin. So we’re going to end that*",2025-04-03T07:56:16

But now that Trump has completely capitulated to Putin and done everything he's asked, the most important lesson is to show him all of that meant nothing to Putin, because Trump is Putin's bitch.

It doesn't matter what kind of deal as long as he can claim that he got a deal to his base back home.  That's why he gave Russia absolutely everything before negotiations even started and pulled support from Ukraine.  He thought that this would force both sides to stop.

The crazy part is that he can't even get Russia to agree even when asking literally nothing from them.

The reason is simple.  Russia would economically collapse should the bullets and bombs stop flying.  The entire Russian economy has been converted to supporting the war effort and an abrupt halt would see the majority of the country lose their jobs overnight.

&gt;“It is an expropriation document,” said Alan Riley, an expert on energy law at the Atlantic Council. “There are no guarantees, no defence clauses, the US puts up nothing.

&gt;“The Americans can walk away, the Ukrainians can’t. I’ve never seen anything like it before.”

&gt;The text leaves little doubt that Mr Trump’s chief objective is to [incorporate Ukraine as a province of America’s oil, gas and resource industries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/03/27/revealed-trump-plan-force-ukraine-restore-putin-gas-empire/).

&gt;It dovetails with parallel talks between the US and Russia for a comprehensive energy partnership, including plans to restore West Siberian gas flows to Europe in large volumes, with US companies and Trump-aligned financiers gaining a major stake in the business.

&gt;The revived gas trade would flow through Ukraine’s network, and later via the Baltic as the sabotaged Nord Stream pipelines are brought back on stream.

&gt;The new draft states that the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund will control Ukraine’s “critical minerals or other minerals, oil, natural gas (including liquified \[sic\] natural gas), fuels or other hydrocarbons and other extractable materials”.",2025-03-31T13:52:02

&gt;The US will control infrastructure linked to natural resources “including, but not limited to, roads, rail, pipelines and other transportation assets; ports, terminals and other logistics facilities and refineries, processing facilities, natural gas liquefaction and/or regasification facilities and similar assets”.

&gt;Three of the five board members on the new fund will be chosen by the US. It will have “A” shares and golden shares. America will receive all the royalties until Ukraine has paid off at least $100bn of war debt to the US, with 4pc interest added – less than the $350bn floated earlier by Mr Trump but still half of Ukraine’s GDP, and unpayable.

&gt;Ukraine has only “B’ shares and will receive 50pc of the royalties only once its arrears are paid off.

&gt;The fund is registered in Delaware but under New York jurisdiction. The US has the first right of refusal on all projects. It has authority to examine the books and accounts of any Ukrainian ministry or agency whenever it wants during working hours.",2025-03-31T13:56:45

It makes no sense logistically, but this is how it works, and it's no surprise that this inflates the prices of the final product.

Most oil goes through several refinements, not just the common fractioning of different fuels, but also frequent mixing with other products from various sources before being further refined into polymers and other materials. At the end of the day, when you buy a Christmas toy for your child that was manufactured in China, there’s a very high chance that the polymer used in the plastic was derived from Russian crude oil.

Similar laws are already used for companies that do business with Cuba, and they work quite effectively.  This is why when Cuba cries about the embargo and the U.S. says (hey you are free to do business with any other country) it’s mostly a lie because companies that do business and trade with Cuba are shut out of the U.S.",2025-03-31T10:13:39

My point is that nobody can stop money from indirectly going into Putin's pockets through consumer goods and products made with Russian crude. Your example with Cuba is somewhat irrelevant because Cuba is such a small country that it can easily be isolated with barely any negative impact. Russia however, cannot be shut off so easily because it is a major producer of crude oil and fuels. Even if the U.S. completely halts imports, Russia could just lower its prices slightly and ramp up exports to other countries like China. The U.S. cannot simply shut down China for doing business with Russia. That will never happen since both countries need each other - China, a major producer, needs the U.S. big market, and vice versa. So practically U.S. is still subsidizing the Russian economy indirectly. Additionally, playing these games hurts other crude oil markets in the Middle East, which are controlled by the U.S. So, it’s not as simple as just cutting Russia off completely. I would argue that it’s impossible at this point in time.",2025-03-31T12:12:16

The U.S. imported a lot of Russian oil before 2022 and significantly less since the war started, but they still import Russian oil to this day.

While the U.S. has significantly reduced direct imports of Russian oil, the global nature of oil markets means that Russian crude still enters the U.S. indirectly. For instance, Russian crude oil is exported to other countries, refined into products like gasoline, kerosene, and diesel, and then exported to the U.S. In such cases, once the oil is refined in another country, it is typically classified based on the country where the refining occurred, not its original source. Therefore, these refined products are not considered Russian imports, even though they have originated from Russian crude.",2025-03-31T01:40:36

This is clearly not a ruse to 1) show his base how tough he is, 2)paint the illusion he's tough on Putin who he's given every concession to in Ukraine/Russia negotiations 

Most importantly, this is theater to distract from Elons destruction of our government and the inaction of fascist policies (disappearing dissident) and a struggling economy being made worse by tariffs. 

The US economy is going to tank this spring - travel by Europeans, Canadian, and many Muslim countries will decrease. Former allies we've betrayed will begin transitioning from a US-centric world view to a multi-sphere lead world, with many turning to China. The destruction of government - slashing departments to barebones with intent to dismantle, will begin showing. Services will slow to a crawl.

1jng61v,Trump Says He Is 'Very Angry' and 'Pissed Off' at Putin Over Ukraine,rollingstone,0,2025-03-30T16:24:54,rollingstone,5,"***From Rolling Stone’s Peter Wade:***

Donald Trump played the strongman in a Saturday interview. The president said he is growing increasingly frustrated with Russia and its refusal to sign a Ukraine ceasefire agreement as well as with Iran for not reaching a nuclear deal with the U.S.

Trump said he is “very angry” and “pissed off” at President Vladimir Putin — so much so he is considering imposing tariffs if Putin does not agree to a deal that would end the war. This could represent a shift in the president’s relationship with Putin which previously had been one of adoration. As recently as last month, Trump bashed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a social media post, calling him a “dictator” and threatening that if he doesn’t agree to a peace deal, “he is not going to have a Country left.”

This is just an attempt of putin and trump to fake a rift in their relationship so we dont suspect they are working together.

This is obviously what it is because he called NBC to deliver this message which is odd because he hates NBC. He is trying to convince the left that he is not working for putin. That way we trust him more with the idea of annexing greenland and canada and other things he plans to do in the future that supports Russia.
