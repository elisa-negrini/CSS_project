But on Monday, Trump made the impromptu announcement that the two countries, which have been embroiled in a three-year war, now have only 10 more days to strike a deal.\n\nAnd it seems that Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, wasn’t thrilled about it.\n\nLink to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-threatens-putin-ally-comparison-joe-biden\\_n\\_688b9214e4b0f5cda486d5b2?utm\\_medium=Social&amp;utm\\_source=reddit&amp;utm\\_campaign=us\\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-threatens-putin-ally-comparison-joe-biden_n_688b9214e4b0f5cda486d5b2?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=us_main)",

But on Monday, Trump [made the impromptu announcement](http://thedailybeast.com/trump-axes-putins-50-day-deadline-with-definitive-new-date/) that the two countries, which have been embroiled in a three-year war, now have only 10 more days to strike a deal.\n\n&gt;And it seems that Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, wasn’t thrilled about it.\n\n&gt;“Trump’s playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10…,” [Medvedev wrote Monday on X](https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1949870764938711343), formerly Twitter. “He should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn’t Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don’t go down the Sleepy Joe road!”\n\n&gt;“Russia and the USA do almost no business together,” [Trump wrote](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114945847973193713). “Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!”\n\n&gt;Trump’s “failed president” jab was likely a reference to [Medvedev’s single term as Russia’s leader, from 2008 to 2012](http://huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/russian-prime-minister-dmitry-medvedev-resigns_in_5e1f1985c5b63211760c21a4). Medvedev’s single term was controversial, and it was viewed by many as a placeholder presidency because Russian law prevented Putin from serving three consecutive terms.\n\nTwo insecure men throwing insults at each other but Medvedev is stupid to keep war mongering.  Ukraine has been whipping their ass, the US has the resources to do far worse and Russia doesn't have the resources including personnel to get into a war with the US.  \n\nNot without China's help.",

Vice-chairman of the Security Council is a job with no formal duties or powers and which didn't exist before Putin created it as a retirement gig for Dima. But he still wants to be president again (and for real) some day, to succeed Putin. Since he was known as a very-relatively-speaking liberal and West-friendly figure within United Russia, Putin allegedly made sure he knew on no uncertain terms that no dissent would be permitted when he launched his invasion in 2022. So he did a total about-face and has since then acted as Putin's attack dog, because western media still pays some attention to his tweets because he was president (even if in-name-only) and because it doesn't conform to how they expect ex-presidents to act. Which they really shouldn't since he's domestically not that relevant at all and everything he says is just calculated to try to stoke outrage. Poorly calculated much of the time, hence a lot of deleted Tweets where he e.g. threatened WWIII over lines that were in fact crossed with impunity.",

Rapprochement from the US and turning that relationship into one that works for them, while not giving up on any of their maximalist demands in Ukraine.”\n\nWhen Trump first announced the 50-day deadline this month, Moscow’s stock exchange actually rose by 2.7 per cent. Monday’s announcement, [made alongside Sir Keir Starmer in Scotland](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-likes-starmer-not-above-trolling-him-3829950?ico=in-line_link), was received less positively, with shares dropping by around 1 per cent.\n\nHowever, Kaczmarski warned that “none of that really matters”, adding: “The only thing that keeps Russia going is its oil exports”.",

He won’t risk that deal with secondary sanctions.”\n\nThe US leader may be equally reluctant to upset India by shutting off their cheap Russian oil and gas, when in recent years it has been US foreign strategy to try and “peel off India from China”, Hall said.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s threat to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Russian exports to the US “holds very little weight in a country that trades only a few billion dollars with the US annually,” said Professor Bülent Gökay, author of *The Politics of Oil*.",

He has threatened huge tariffs and trade wars so many times that there is now even an acronym for it – [Taco, or Trump Always Chickens Out](https://inews.co.uk/news/trumps-taco-dilemma-two-week-pause-iran-risks-chicken-out-3762532?srsltid=AfmBOop7I3XQDn9pb4wHgMcnsrc1GRFcpJ3MaC-ogZXZgw8Y6To0XvhD&amp;ico=in-line_link).\n\nBut in reality, on his own terms at least, Trump has won many of the fights that he’s picked. Even before he took office, Trump took on big tech over what he alleged [was “censorship” of conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57754435) – and was rewarded with millions of dollars in donations to his inauguration, public apologies, and the CEOs of the tech giants lining up around him on the podium.\n\nTrump took on America’s law firms for representing his adversaries – a constitutionally-protected right – and many of them folded, signing agreements to do pro bono work representing causes the US President supports and to cut down on activities he doesn’t, such as [diversity, equity, and inclusion programmes](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/mark-zuckerberg-sounded-death-knell-all-diversity-initiatives-3481729?srsltid=AfmBOoogmplZA6gc7XX4GtBguaEgnYJPirMeQI4GDhewibPlJPci2x3y&amp;ico=in-line_link).\n\nTrump has fought the US media and won, with the CBS network settling a multi-million-dollar lawsuit with Trump over a *60 Minutes* interview segment with Kamala Harris. Almost every independent legal analyst in America believes CBS would have triumphed if the case had come to court, but CBS’s parent company, Paramount, [reportedly did not want Trump to block a merger deal](https://www.wsj.com/business/media/paramount-to-pay-16-million-to-settle-trump-lawsuit-over-60-minutes-interview-fd8dd21c) – so it folded.",

        "body": "And even on tariff policy, where Trump has seemed to publicly cave so often, he is – on his own terms at least – winning. Ursula von der Leyen [agreed to blanket US tariffs of 15 per cent](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-set-stage-colossal-trade-war-could-spiral-out-of-control-3802860?ico=in-line_link) on EU goods exported to the US, without any retaliation or trade war, something that would’ve been seen as impossible just months ago. That is still a hefty new tax that US consumers will pay, but it was the policy Trump wanted, and he got it; the EU folded.\n\nNow, it’s Putin’s turn. The US could certainly do plenty to back up Trump’s threats. Sanctions need to be constantly updated and extended to remain effective, and Trump hasn’t done this since taking office. Merely renewing these would tighten the financial noose on Russia.\n\nPutting financial pressure, such as sanctions or tariffs, on Russia’s allies would do the same. Trump could accelerate arms sales to Ukraine, or even resume financial aid. There are plenty of options available to Trump if Putin does nothing, and the US President has the will to follow through.\n\nThe question is whether or not his heart is really in the fight. Trump has very obviously wanted some kind of deal and rapprochement with Putin and Russia for a long time, and Putin has been confident that he can wait it out and get a deal on his own terms.\n\nPutin doesn’t have to worry about the niceties that democratic leaders do – he has almost no domestic political opposition and isn’t constrained by elections. He can grind it out, securing his goals, whatever the human cost.\n\nPutin will almost certainly test Trump and make him prove that his threats are serious – he will call Trump’s bluff. Then, the question for Trump and the world becomes whether or not he actually means it, and will follow through with action against Russia.\n\nThe problem here is that no one, quite probably including Trump himself, knows the answer, and it may even change from day to day. The stakes, especially for Ukrainians being bombarded day after day, couldn’t be higher – but Trump doesn’t yet even seem sure what game he’s playing.\n\n**James Ball is political editor of** ***The*** ***New World*****, formerly known as** ***The New European***",

        "body": "Late last year as he was campaigning to return to the White House, [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?srsltid=AfmBOoqUJOsox8tSs3178O5J61w50bR_DqZuidT63GrzOIlc9RelXdNS&amp;ico=in-line_link) said that if elected, he would work hard to “ununite” China and Russia.\n\nForeign policy experts have dubbed this Trump’s “reverse Nixon strategy”. They are referring to Richard Nixon’s diplomatic coup when he met Chinese leader Mao Zedong, ending over 20 years of hostility with communist China and breaking Beijing’s alliance with [Moscow](https://inews.co.uk/topic/moscow?srsltid=AfmBOorabuuRB8Be5T8VNvBLzk_3bDkpR6LKYCy7DCsHocPH2ZJx76VW&amp;ico=in-line_link).\n\nBack then, Washington was able to exploit the multiple frictions that had built up in relations between the brotherly communist states and included military clashes over a disputed section of their border in 1969.\n\nToday, the US has no such possibility. Over the past 30 years, China and Russia have built a relationship around common interests that is highly pragmatic, flexible and resilient to shocks. They are united by their [determination to reduce Western dominance](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/xi-moscow-meeting-putin-power-move-message-trump-3682825?ico=in-line_link) of international affairs and create what they term a “just” global order based on non-Western norms and values.\n\nThis does not mean to say that China and Russia do not have differences. They do, but they are manageable. For example, the Chinese leadership was reportedly unimpressed by Moscow’s decision late last year to [deepen relations with North Korea](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/north-korea-gaining-sensitive-tech-wealth-russia-weakness-3481928?srsltid=AfmBOoqAgGiZAQIsSuTdD17KZFWfUeLrQ5fXK1QAyGireSyAhuh0UMuI&amp;ico=in-line_link) to support its war in Ukraine. Chinese policymakers fear that the signing of a [mutual defence](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-north-korea-visit-weapons-war-support-3117028?srsltid=AfmBOorI67LUJfICJAOfvi5w2fbg-4CzKlLJ-kdy4m4nhBhKwTvRR5kG&amp;ico=in-line_link) treaty by the two countries might complicate Beijing’s relations with Pyongyang.\n\nLike Russia, China sees divisions and weakness in the West, but its [instinct is to play the long game](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-kickstarted-americas-downfall-world-china-3634001?ico=in-line_link) and seek evolutionary change in international affairs. By contrast, Moscow is in a hurry, and its approach is revolutionary. It wants to break what remains of Western unity and exploit the emerging chaos to dictate the establishment of a new security architecture in Europe, one that restores an exclusive zone of Russian interest.\n\nThis explains [Vladimir Putin’s](https://inews.co.uk/topic/vladimir-putin?srsltid=AfmBOoq7R52rpNP0gW4QzHZS2LD0EmhTuJyGGM8avfQoozEJfBiCA4i8&amp;ico=in-line_link) decision to unleash [full-scale war on Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia-ukraine-war?srsltid=AfmBOopffB_kcDqUwvIQCCNghZNVyuk8x5Nnn_kqfsMNWR8XuqgcvOYd&amp;ico=in-line_link). Despite its stated neutrality in the conflict and a platitudinous “peace plan” drawn up with Brazil, China has stood by Russia’s side and [enabled it to continue fighting](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/xi-supercharge-russia-war-red-line-3059759?ico=in-line_link). Without Chinese support, Russia would have sued for peace long ago.",

        "body": "Not only does China buy about 50 per cent of Russia’s crude oil exports, it also imports Russian gas, providing Moscow with vitally needed income that has been sharply reduced from Western sources because of sanctions and other changes in trade patterns since February 2022.\n\nIn addition, China exports dual-use technologies such as machine tools and components that are used in the defence industry to produce weapons. Around 70 per cent of Russia’s machine tool imports come from China and about 90 per cent of imported microelectronics.\n\nAccording to a recent Bloomberg report, 92 per cent of the foreign parts found in Russian drones used against targets in Ukraine originate in China. These include electronics, cameras, engines, antennas and navigations modules. Last week, Ukraine’s GUR defence intelligence agency claimed that it had discovered for the first time a drone made entirely from Chinese components.\n\nBulldozers delivered from China played a key role in Russia’s ability to build defensive lines in Ukraine in early 2023 that thwarted Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the summer of 2024.\n\nAs the Chinese foreign minister told the EU’s foreign policy chief in early July in a rare moment of candour, Beijing cannot afford to see Russia defeated in Ukraine because this would allow the US to focus its full attention on China. This suggests China is comfortable with the war continuing if it does not escalate to dangerous levels.\n\nAccording to Chinese accounts, in March 2023, [Xi Jinping](https://inews.co.uk/topic/xi-jinping?srsltid=AfmBOopZ-1uD4C8F_2ZvRH3Jl1cTDlWnIVbyH-zAYxnmt-fQjPXWXvPg&amp;ico=in-line_link) warned Putin against threatening to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The Russian leader’s nuclear rhetoric had caused considerable alarm in Washington and persuaded the Biden administration that the defeat of Russia’s army in Ukraine would be an undesirable outcome because of the risk of escalation.\n\nHowever, just as it is impossible to prove that Putin was bluffing, there is no evidence to show that his threats were serious. The Russians have also not admitted that there was Chinese intervention to calm the waters.",

We found irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling. And we discovered deeply troubling actions taken by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, particularly their acceptance and willingness to rely on the ‘Steele Dossier’ without verifying its methodology or sourcing.* \n\n \n\n*“Now, as we head towards the 2020 elections, China and Iran have joined Russia in attempts to disrupt our democracy, exacerbate societal divisions, and sow doubts about the legitimacy and integrity of our institutions, our electoral process and our republic.*\n\n \n\n*“We must do better in 2020. The Committee’s five reports detail the signs and symptoms of that interference and show us how to protect campaigns, state and local entities, our public discourse, and our democratic institutions. I join with Vice Chairman Warner in urging everyone — our colleagues, those in the Administration, state and local elections officials, the media, and the American public — to read them and take the recommendations seriously.”*\n\nThen Senator Marco Rubio\n\n[https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/2020/08/18/press-rubio-statement-senate-intel-release-volume-5-bipartisan-russia-report/](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/2020/08/18/press-rubio-statement-senate-intel-release-volume-5-bipartisan-russia-report/)",

Responding to President Trump’s ultimatum to Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin that he “accept a peace deal with Ukraine within 50 days or face new secondary sanctions,” Rice said, “I think the best news that we could possibly give to the Ukrainian people is that the United States and Europe have finally aligned around the idea that Vladimir Putin will not be stopped with words. He will only be stopped if he believes that he can go no further, he can win no further.” Rice suggested that American and European alignment on handling Russia marks a “turning point” in the Ukraine conflict, raising the prospect of additional weapons deliveries and support for the embattled nation. Rice also discussed the possible challenges of enforcing secondary sanctions on entities doing business with Russia, and shared her view on why it’s not a bad thing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is jointly serving as National Security Advisor. ",

The days of doing this without consequences are coming to an end.”\n\nIt is unclear if the secondary tariffs mentioned by Trump refer to the secondary sanctions package in the bill or a separate initiative.\n\nLough says Trump needs to allow the passage of the sanctions bill through Congress “and be ready to sign it into law if needed”.\n\nBut Trump could also help by providing Ukraine with more of the weapons they need to defend and attack the invading Russians. Exact details of the weaponry Trump announced on Monday are not yet known.\n\nSome US media have suggested that Trump could send Ukraine Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of 1,600 to 2,500km – far longer than missiles currently in Ukraine’s arsenal.",

Trump is very good at political theatre (…) and a lot of his statements are not because of Putin per se, but because of the pressure within his own party and also international pressure,” she said.\n\nMiron emphasised that Trump’s approach to the war in Ukraine was ultimately driven by his perception of US interests, rather than a firm alignment with either side, and that any moves he makes should be viewed through that lens.\n\n“He’s not on the Ukrainian side and he’s not on the Russian side. And I think this is something to understand in whatever he does. He will pursue American interests first,” said Miron.\n\nTrump appears to be using both “a carrot and a stick” approach because “he got what he wanted at the Nato summit, for instance – he needs to appease the Europeans in a way, but in such a way that the Americans are not losing on this”.\n\nMiron said: “I don’t think that it’s a substantial difference in his strategy. He’s trying to manoeuvre because we also have to understand that he’s not the only one who is making decisions. He still has a Congress, he has a House of Representatives. So he has to balance it out and he has to be very careful.\n\n“So for Trump, it will be manoeuvring, trying not to alienate Russia, but in such a way as not to publicly show it,” she said. “For Trump, this is \\[Joe\\] Biden’s war.”",

Trump wants to be close to Putin because he's powerful, but the Kremlin probably have some sort of blackmail material that would tank Trump's fragile administration, especially now that he's bungled his Epstein scandal. \n\n\nI think Trump was happy to play along while Russia's plans to seize Ukraine seemed feasible, but now that plan seems unrealistic and the war is increasingly dragging on. Trump now wants to bully and threaten Putin now that Trump realizes he can't give Putin what he wants. If Putin can't receive the carrot, Trump has to try and give him the stick, because neutrality/staying out of it might lead Putin to burning Trump out of spite. \n\n\nI think we might consider Trump has similar calculations about Pam Bondi now, because she might have seen incriminating information from the Epstein files about Trump, he'll feel the need to appease and protect her, but the moment he doesn't think that strategy will work he'll probably go on the attack. For the moment she's probably the only person in his administration that he wouldn't remove, but if she's somehow removed from power or forced to resign I might expect him to find a reason to have her arrested. ",

Now, Trump doesn't seem to be worried about elections or money and Russia looks militarily inept and economically distressed.",

        "body": "This is exactly what Zelensky was trying to say in the Oval Office before Trump got defensive and interrupted to tell him he didn't have the cards. He was just saying that getting Putin to agree to a ceasefire is meaningless without a security guarantee from the U.S. because Putin will simply violate the ceasefire, as he has done in the past. Without a security guarantee from the U.S. there is no disincentive for Putin in violating it. In that scenario, Putin has all the cards, not the U.S., not \"master negotiator\" Trump. \n\n\n Trump is such a dumb fuck and was so determined to humiliate Zelensky and show what a \"strong\" leader he is  because of his personal vendetta that he humiliated himself (and the entire fucking country, but that's neither here nor there). \n\n\nHere he is months later having learned from experience what should have been obvious to anyone with a brain, and what Zelensky told him that day that sent jd and Trump into a hissy fit. Putin does not honor treaties. Putin is not interested in deals. Putin will never come to the table in earnest. The only scenario where Putin capitulates would be if Russia becomes too crippled to continue this war...but as soon as they recover, he will pick up where he left off. \n\n\nDo I think Trump gets it, now? Hell, no. He will keep playing dictator pick me. He can't help himself. ",

I’m telling you I have no choice,’” Trump said during one 2024 fundraiser, according to the audio exclusively released to CNN. “And then \\[Putin\\] goes, like, ‘I don’t believe you.’ But he believed me 10 per cent.”\n\nTrump later said he gave a similar warning to Chinese President Xi Jinping, stating that the US would bomb Beijing if China moved to invade Taiwan. “He thought I was crazy,” Trump said of Xi’s reaction, adding: “We never had a problem.”\n\nHowever, analysts have cautioned against taking Trump’s remarks literally.\n\n“We should be careful about taking Trump’s statements too seriously,” said Anders Puck Nielsen, a military analyst based in Denmark.\n\n“He has several times before indicated that his patience with Russia was running out, but it has so far not materialised into action. At best, Trump has indicated a willingness to continue the deliveries of weapons approved during the Biden administration, and that is going to gradually taper off.”\n\n“The trend is that American support for Ukraine is declining,” Nielsen pointed out. “It is, of course, good if Trump is beginning to understand that Putin is not looking to end the war, but it has taken him an inordinate amount of time to come to that realisation,” he said.\n\n“And he does not seem willing to deliver the offensive weapons to Ukraine that would be required to put Russia under serious pressure. Some people thought Trump would be tougher than his predecessor and more willing to put Russia under pressure to end the war, but he has actually turned out to be even more submissive than Biden. And I don’t think we should expect that to change.”",

He’s all carrot, no stick. He blames both sides and regards it as not a massive issue for the US. He tries to use reason with Russia to achieve peace and a better bilateral relationship. Russia only respects the logic of force,” he said.\n\nForeman pointed out that Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff “is still promoting improved trade links between the US and Russia”, while Trump “doesn’t want to be seen to fail in bringing peace — that’s why the US backed away from the last round of talks.”\n\n“Call me sceptical, but I’m not convinced he’s now going to change his approach dramatically. I see a lot of wishful thinking,” he said. “Even his decision on arms was half-hearted.”",

That’s what we’re seeing,” she added.",

That has been his position now for three straight months, since the US President [concluded in late April](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/zelensky-trump-meet-first-time-explosive-white-house-clash-3661784?srsltid=AfmBOopyDQXQku4J__gM51ZPQBzQXT_6ZeEjm65McDhht2D_EejPUpHD&amp;ico=in-line_link) that the Kremlin leader might simply be toying with him or, as he put it at the time, “tapping me along”.\n\nOn Thursday, the toying continued as the two men spent another hour talking to one another by telephone. It was their sixth publicly reported conversation since Trump returned to office, and as soon as it ended the White House conceded it had been essentially useless.\n\n“I’m not happy…I didn’t make any progress with him today at all,” [the President told](https://x.com/cspan/status/1940883805100773544) reporters, describing himself as “very disappointed with the conversation”. After insisting on the campaign trail last year that he could solve the [war in Ukraine ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia-ukraine-war?ico=in-line_link)on his first day in office, Trump now finds himself reduced to a regular diet of public grousing about Putin. Yet he has unleashed no reprisals against the Russian president to end Moscow’s foot-dragging and prod the war towards its end. “I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad,” shrugged Trump on Thursday, again providing zero indication of any consequences for the Russian leader.\n\nMoscow, by contrast, appears to believe that Thursday’s call was a triumph. It took place after the Pentagon [paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/us-weapons-freeze-dangerous-moment-ukraine-putin-steps-up-offensive-3783658?ico=in-line_link), citing depleted stockpiles within the well-worn US arsenal. The move horrified [Ukraine](https://inews.co.uk/topic/ukraine?ico=in-line_link), but will have delighted the Russians who continue to note Trump’s oft-stated scepticism about the wisdom of Washington’s bottomless commitment to defending Kyiv.",

He insisted that Russia continued to seek “a negotiated solution” to the war, but only on Putin’s terms. “The President informed Trump that Russia will not give up on eliminating all the root causes of the confrontation that has arisen,” Ushakov continued, in time-honoured phrases that the Russians use to indicate they seek a surrender of Ukrainian independence and sovereignty, and [Nato’s ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/nato?ico=in-line_link)withdrawal from positions it considers too close to Russia’s borders.\n\nAt times, Ushakov’s statement seemed designed deliberately to underscore the notion that Putin sees Trump as his own personal plaything. He claimed the two men discussed “promising joint economic projects”, including some in the areas of energy and space exploration. Having surrendered no ground over Ukraine, Putin then wished Trump a happy Independence Day, and noted the two men “can pick up the phone any time” and talk to one another again.",

The White House says the Pentagon is ready to take further military action to weaken [Iran’s ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/iran?ico=in-line_link)leadership if necessary, while the Kremlin is given an entirely free pass.\n\nWhile some Republicans on Capitol Hill believe that Putin is the clear aggressor in the conflict and should be facing – at the very least – an additional raft of American sanctions, Trump has indicated that he plans to blunt their legislative initiative. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has softened a bill calling for 500 per cent US tariffs to be imposed on countries that purchase Russian oil. [Last weekend](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-asked-about-us-sanctions-bill-suggests-it-would-impact-ukraine-peace-2025-06-30/), after coming under fresh White House pressure, the Kremlin said backers of the proposed legislation should be careful not to damage peacekeeping efforts in the conflict.",

The relationship between the two leaders remains as enigmatic as ever, with Putin supremely confident that he can divert Trump’s attention with the promise of rich economic rewards for the US in the event that the war is resolved to Moscow’s satisfaction.\n\nThat Trump is left looking like a patsy, dancing to the Kremlin’s tune, does not appear to trouble White House insiders. It also does nothing to advance the day when Ukraine’s people and its democracy are both considered secure, and Putin is held accountable for war crimes against his neighbour.",

Israel brought war to Iran's doorstep.\n\n\nConsensus is that if Russia is strong, it will invade Poland first then Lithuania. Otherwise, reverse the order. After these, either Finland or Latvia. The goal would be to get to Norway and Denmark where it would control the Baltic Sea. Once it controls this, no other countries could defend the rest of Europe because the Baltic Sea is crucial for the Navy. At this point, it will probably force most countries between the Baltic Sea and the Iran to sign an agreement giving up their sovereignty to Russia. Anyways, it will be as bad as Poland and Lithuania allow it to be. If they want sovereignty, they will push back as hard as Ukraine. Lithuania is incredible vulnerable because it is longer than it is wider and Putin just needs to get access to the Baltic Sea. That said, this is extremely easy to do for most large militaries because even if it's a meatgrinder, they will make it across. But the hard part is making it a battle every time they need to access the sea. On the other side of the Baltic is Norway. This invasion will happen via the arctic circle. I don't think any major war has been fought in the arctic circle, which has no solid land beneath, only ice and water. It will be much tough in Poland since they are a bigger country and very vocal about their opposition to Russia",

If you don't at least see the value of an egalitarian society then you're not really going to support modern democracy, and remain at best stuck at the non-universal forms of democracy of the past, or at worst turn towards reactionary and authoritarian views. It's not \"our democracy\" but rather \"the democracy supported by some of us, while a lot of other people want to restrict or get rid of it even though they don't say that out loud\". When you see how easy it was for the supposed moderates to vote for an obvious fascist, extrapolate from that. Are they committed authoritarians? No. Are they committed to democracy? Neither.

        "body": "Trump's been trying to readmit Russia into the \"international club\" so to speak for years. \n\nBut lately, it seems that Trump is having to come to terms with the reality that he's not equipped to negotiate anything resembling an end to this war. And after glorifying and defending Putin for years no less. Even now, Trump is desperately hoping for Putin's cooperation in return for pleading his case at the G7.\n\nBut because Trump now recognizes that brokering a peace will be far more complicated and difficult than he previously imagined, he's become frustrated over the fact that he won't be handed a \"win\" and entitled to some kind of accolade for his feckless efforts.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump cares far more about being awarded for some half-baked attempt at a fleeting agreement than he does about actually ending the war.\n\nThat said, Trump promised to end the war on \"day one,\" but during his first call with Putin, they chatted about their \"shared history\" and discussed how Trump could help Putin realize his goals and assist Russia in seizing control of a large chunk of Ukrainian land.\n\nImmediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a \"dictator\"\n\nTrump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies publicly denigrated Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership for weeks, and without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.\n\nTrump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to \"negotiate\" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.\n\nTrump had the gall to call Zelensky a \"dictator without elections,\" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.\n\nThe truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.\n\nEvery \"deal\" he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.\n\nHe even previously called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" \n\nTrump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO. This move would weaken the alliance and strain our relationships with allies; effectively carrying out Putin's most ambitious goals for him.\n\nTrump has practically enabled Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.\n\nTrump has defended Putin for years, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a \"killer\" who murders his political opponents.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over abandoned US military outposts.\n\nTrump ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed these forces to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.\n\nAnd let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after he demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are crucial for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.\n\nAnd look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been Putin's personal backscratcher and useful idiot for years, but what's really irritating right now is how Trump cares very little about the war and its ramifications, and is far more concerned about how he can take credit for negotiating a lukewarm deal at best.\n\nHe's desperate to be awarded the title of \"peacemaker,\" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, straining our alliances, and offering up Ukraine's territory to Russia with no real security guarantees in return.\n\nHe'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.\n\nPutin is a dangerous expansionist on a warpath to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.\n\nTrump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recover and reorganize his forces, only to return at some later time with another \"special military operation\" that's been repurposed and freshly equipped for its land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.\n\nPutin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, not by Donald Trump at least, and as made evident by the fact that Putin has been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.\n\nFor Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as he can demand a Nobel Peace Prize for whatever iteration of a lazy, worthless, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",

        "body": "That's part of the problem - *we have* And by \"we\" I mean users, platform owners/operators, ISPs, the FBI, etc.. Inherently the problem is communications via the internet (blogs, social media, published videos, etc.) encompass some form of speech. There are those who believe personal rights to speech extend to these platforms and services, while there are those who believe what flies and doesn't is entirely at the discretion of the owner/operator of said platforms/services. So save for a few generally universally agreed upon ills such as violence and sexual exploitation, the platform operators and government are at odds on where the line resides.\n\nThere's also the problem of how rapidly the public internet can spread information in general. If we presumed no bad faith or ulterior motives, there is still a significant possibility that for every person who passes information along, what gets relayed to the next person (or their localized audience) will be modified in a way that changes the original information. There is no reliable and direct method that is not time and effort intensive to accurately trace the genealogy of any story put out on the internet (which also a reason why some of the most beloved creepypastas have endured - they were relatively plausible albeit entirely fictitious). And that's going to get *even harder* with the advent of relatively easy to use generative AI tools to edit videos and images. Bad actors know the average person isn't going to bother really researching things as long as it looks real enough.\n\nBut bot farms, specifically. That's truly whack-a-mole. Even if a domain or site is determined to be acting in bad faith or a harmful (let's say not outright illegal) way, the best you can do is choose to not engage with/block content from that site or report it to their hosting provider. In the case of the latter, they may choose to do nothing unless there's a significant number of complaints. I have firsthand experience with this - my company had its corporate site cloned and then used in an imposter site that was scamming people using our name and branding/logos. It took several complaints and presentation of evidence that the masquerading site was illegitimate before it was taken down. Even if a bot farm does get whammied as illegal, it gets shut down through seizure by the FBI or terminated by the hosting provider. So what happens then? They just shift over elsewhere and start up again.\n\nI do appreciate the outlook of wanting to push back against the tide, though. There's actually a documentary on HBO Max mainly about Russian interference that has a fairly lengthy section about the bot farms. iirc it's called Agents of Chaos.",

It's Sun Tzu, The Art of War, and no, the people that realize this are not crazy, drunk, senile, or demented. \n\nContact Governor Gavin Newsom and ask him what it would be that would send shivers down our spine. I, for one, believe it is our right to know, now especially since Senators have been assassinated.",

        "body": "I'd like to think that but given Trump is on Putin's side I highly doubt it.\n\n&gt;Trump is clearly getting frustrated with Putin,\n\nNo he is being frustrated in his intentions *by Zelensky* who has shown he will not respond to threats or bribes into betraying his country. There's no payday unless Trump delivers. The vocal concern for the death toll is pure fabrication. Trump does not understand and cannot feel compassion. He's a narcissist. He's manipulating the discussion to make Zelensky the bad boy so he can push for a replacement that is more compliant. \n\n&gt;The US really does have the necessary tools to shift the balance and put Russia in an impossible position, where stepping down becomes the best option for Putin.\n\nPutin is finished if he loses this war. There's no stepping down, no \"Golden Bridge\" to a pleasant retirement in a dacha in the countryside. It's an open 7th floor window, a polonium tea party, or an exploding helicopter ride the moment it happens. He made a huge mistake. He knows it and as long as he's breathing, and wants to continue doing so, the war goes on.\n\nRussia is undoubtedly in trouble. War costs money. Russia's economy is about the size of Italy's. Compared to the US, and the EU which has an economy about the same as the US, it is a minnow in a sea of sharks. It is 3 1/2 years into a 3 day war Putin stupidly started and is nowhere near winning. Almost 50% of all its government expenditure is going towards the war. Interest rates have been raised to 29% and banks have been forced to give the government loans. Which it has to pay extortionate interest rates on. Inflation is soaring. It is reduced to begging help from North Korea, Iran and China. 1 million of its soldiers are either dead, missing, or wounded. At that level of loss the risk of revolt is a very real possibility, especially if they start drawing from the youth of Moscow and St Petersburg, hence they're bussing in replacements from North Korea. Experts say it can't go on and that Russia is close to buckling. This is the year it ends, they say, and if pressure is maintained and support for Ukraine continues it will end with Russia losing and Putin's destructive reign over.\n\nWhile Russia is burning through Rubles, and its young men, at a frightening rate, US support for Ukraine has been just over 1% of just its military budget and that's from mostly mothballed stock that's cheaper to give away than dispose of. Money that is spent, is spent in the US replenishing stocks.  It seems a no brainer to bring down America's greatest adversary so decisively for so little cost, and at no loss of American lives, and a grateful Ukraine ready to grant Trump all the mineral licences he wants and probably that Nobel prize nomination he craves so much.\n\nThe West holds the cards and by association, assuming support continues, so does Ukraine. Putin holds none, bar the nuclear one, which he can't use, except as a sabre to rattle. He knows this, and so does Trump, or he should know it. So it is puzzling why he doesn't jump at the chance of kneecapping an enemy that historically hates the US and has been working to destroy it for 8 decades. Instead of quickly ending this by increasing sanctions and increasing aid to Ukraine so they can finish the job, he's maneuvering to give Putin, the enemy, everything he wants, and Ukraine, the ally, nothing. One could be forgiven for wondering whose interests is Trump representing in these \"peace\" talks? Ukraine's, Putin's, or his own?\n\nThe war's end is there for the taking. Why doesn't Trump take it?",

        "body": "I suspect neither of these is wholly true. Everything we have seen of Trump since his return to office suggests he is fixated only on bolstering his own image. He seems to have an obsession with delivering on the big-ticket promises he made before returning to the White House. One of those promises was to end the war in Ukraine. The biggest block to achieving that is, Trump seems to now understand, one Vladimir Putin. Between not turning up to his own peace talks and firing ballistic missiles at civilians, Trump seems to have finally realised that Putin isn’t someone he can work with to reach a lasting peace.\n\nAt this stage, I personally don’t care [what Trump’s motives are.](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/trump-says-putin-has-gone-absolutely-crazy-and-warns-of-russias-downfall-3714101?ico=in-line_link) Some say he desperately wants a Nobel Peace Prize. If he manages to end the war in a way that doesn’t mean Ukraine’s subjugation, fine, give him two. But true victory for Ukraine must mean a clear path to the end of Putinism.\n\nI genuinely believe that the conditions and means exist for this to happen in the next 12 months.\n\nTrump is clearly getting frustrated with Putin, and Ukraine’s recent ability to [strike deep within Russian territory adds an extra level of peril ](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/ukraine-russia-drone-attack-nuclear-response-3726514?ico=in-line_link)for Russian citizens, also suffering war fatigue.\n\nFor now, at least, Trump is not leveraging America’s strength in a way that exposes Putin’s weakness. The US could lift sanctions to make life easier for Russia; or it could impose greater economic hardship on the country. It could also make a firm commitment to support Ukraine militarily in a way that would make Putin’s position as a wartime leader untenable.\n\nTrump surely knows that if he is brave enough to use all of the economic and military tools at his disposal, he is the only international figure who could credibly threaten Russia to the extent that he can also offer Putin an off ramp – ultimately seeing the Russian President leave office so someone else can take charge. In short: Putin’s strength as a leader is contingent on Trump’s continued refusal to fully use America’s might.\n\nThe US really does have the necessary tools to shift the balance and put Russia in an impossible position, where stepping down becomes the best option for Putin. The only remaining question is: does he have the cojones to stand up to Putin? The whole world – and especially Ukraine – would be grateful.  \n  \n**Luke McGee is an award-winning journalist specialising in European politics, security and diplomacy.

But Ukraine fired back – hitting a [Russian](https://inews.co.uk/topic/russia?ico=in-line_link) fuel depot situated near to a strategic bomber airbase.\n\nIn pictures across social media, the Engels oil refinery, based in the Saratov Oblast in the west of the country was engulfed in flames.\n\nIt comes after Kyiv carried out a large underwater explosion aimed at the crucial road and rail bridge linking the Russian-held Crimean peninsula to mainland Russia on Tuesday, causing damage to its underwater foundations.\n\nThis followed the audacious “Operation Spider’s Web” drone attacks on Moscow’s strategic bomber fleet over the weekend that saw a number of Vladimir Putin’s aircraft wiped out. Ukraine claims that it targeted 41 strategic bombers in the operation, adding that “at least” 13 were destroyed. Security officials say the shock incursion took 18 months to plan and saw many drones smuggled into Russia.\n\nVideos of the explosions that flooded social media were striking and Kyiv’s degrading of Russia’s war machine sends a message that is hard to overlook. But experts still aren’t convinced the attacks will shift the balance of the war in a substantial way.\n\n“There’s always been this sort of underestimation of the Ukrainians. And each time the Ukrainians do this, it makes the Russians sit up and think again,” said John Foreman, associate fellow at Chatham House and former UK defence attaché to Moscow and Kyiv.",

I’m not sure, because ultimately Russia wants Ukraine to surrender, it doesn’t want to parley with it.”\n\n# Time to move ahead with sanctions \n\nThe timing of the attacks, which occurred around direct negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul on Monday, was no coincidence but an effort to underscore that Ukraine won’t agree to unfavourable terms, Foreman pointed out.\n\n“I think Ukraine was signalling to Russia its determination to fight on. I think it was signalling that Ukraine has cards to play, that it’s not just going to sit there and be the recipient of Russian aggression,” he said.\n\n“Russia’s going to get back some of its own, what it’s trying to inflict onto Ukrainians. And Ukraine won’t roll over at the negotiating table. So I don’t think the timing was accidental.”\n\nBeyond their impact on Russia’s military capabilities, the Ukrainian attacks also serve as a reminder to the Russian people that the war is still ongoing—and that its consequences can be felt at home as well, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin may leverage the attacks to influence Donald Trump’s decision-making, asserting that Kyiv cannot be trusted and that President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government is illegitimate, Forman said.\n\n“His reaction, I think, will be more to try and convince Americans, Trump in particular, that Ukrainians are an obstacle to peace, not Russia,” he said. “But of course, what he’s forgetting is that he, Putin, has been the one who launched the legal war. It’s him who’s been committing war crimes against Ukrainian civilians by his troops.”\n\nThe attacks also add another layer of pressure on the US President, who has been hesitant to impose swift new sanctions and other financial measures on Moscow, arguing that they would hinder negotiations.\n\n“The approach they’ve taken by offering carrots to Russia and not using sticks like sanctions has failed. So I think there’s a very large chance, a very high chance, that Trump will try and walk away,” Forman said.",

        "body": "However, former US Ambassador to Nato and former special representative to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, believes that Trump still wants to demonstrate he can reach a deal and may soon seek Congress’s approval of the measures, which he could then use to pressure Putin into agreeing to a ceasefire.\n\n“I think President Trump has deliberately held back because he is trying to pull Putin in. He wants Putin to agree to a ceasefire and then a settlement,” he said. But Putin is “playing games” with the negotiations, he is reading Trump’s position as “weak,” wants to continue fighting, and therefore, “it’s time to move ahead” with sanctions, Volker said.\n\nBy applying continuing military and economic pressure on Moscow, the US, Ukraine and European allies would strain Russia’s resources, weaken its position, “and just have to hope that sooner rather than later Putin will come to the conclusion that he has to end the war.”\n\n# Trump doesn’t see Ukraine as critical for US security  \n\nThe approach of the current US administration differs significantly from that of former President Joe Biden’s administration, as Trump and his cabinet are “much more focused on China and the Asia-Pacific” and view Russia as a declining power.\n\n“My major concern is that this administration fundamentally doesn’t care about Ukraine in the same way as perhaps Biden did,” he said. “They see Ukraine as a non-critical matter for US security” and they think the Europeans as well as Canada should be doing more about their security.\n\n“So I think ultimately, without the Americans fully engaged, bringing all levers of American power to bear, the scenario is that the war will continue.”\n\nIn the months ahead, we likely won’t see “a dramatic breakthrough by one side or the other,” Foreman said.",

I will have it solved within one day, a peace between them,” Trump said of the war, which at that point had been ongoing for more than a year since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMAY 2023: “They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying.

I don’t want you guys going over there. I don’t want you going over there.”\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\" “That is a war that’s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president,” the Republican said during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday.

It's now baked even deeper into your system of patronage and protection even as it becomes an ever growing drain on the resources of the country.\n\nSo the choice is a forever war or an equally ruinous armed peace that will sooner or later end in your destruction, or taking huge political risks by cutting the army down to size.",

Russia would keep territory that it controls in Ukraine’s east and south, including the Crimean Peninsula. It would also receive promises from the West to lift economic sanctions and not to admit Ukraine to NATO. For Ukraine, the West could commit to military and economic support if Russia attacks again and, more immediately, to integrate Ukraine even more closely into the European economy. \n\nThis is so messed up. russia doesn't deserve any concessions. How does it make sense to let russia keep Ukraine's stolen territory AND lift sanctions?? So they're keeping what they stole and the \"consequences\" are that they get a reward of sanctions relief... wtf?! And on top of that, Ukraine isn't allowed to join NATO because... why exactly? Why does russia get to decide what alliances Ukraine is allowed to join? Does Ukraine have a similar power over russia? Of course not. It's just one-sided.\n\nAlso, \"the West could commit to military and economic support if Russia attacks again\" doesn't make sense either. What does this mean, exactly? What would the West commit to doing that is not already being done now, and why isn't that being done now? This whole thing about \"if russia attacks again\" is BS, because russia keeps attacking and attacking right now. Why must russia attack \"again\" in order to trigger some kind of bigger response from the West?\n\nI just don't understand why people don't realize that **russia is eventually going to try to take all of Ukraine -- and beyond that -- unless it is stopped by force.** So russia either needs to be stopped by force now within Ukraine, or in the future after taking all of Ukraine. Which will it be?",

He’s playing with fire!” Here apparently was evidence from the horse’s mouth that Trump has long been playing nice with and protecting the tyrannical Russian leader and war criminal. There were, of course, no details.\"\n\n\"Did these messages signal some sort of pivot for Trump? Who knows with him? Trump could just as easily in the middle of the night zap out a post inviting Putin to his big, beautiful upcoming military parade in Washington, DC. But these posts have returned to the spotlight the curious relationship between Trump and Putin, and any such assessment has to include a fundamental fact that has been memory-holed and generally absent from the national political conversation: Trump initially won the presidency partly because Putin covertly attacked the 2016 election.\"\n\n\"Since he returned to the Oval Office, Trump has generally acted in sync with his longstanding affinity for Putin. He badgered and threatened Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, blaming him for the Russia-Ukraine war that was launched by Putin, and repeatedly expressed sympathy and support for Putin, even as Russian forces bombed civilian targets and continued [kidnapping](https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/fact-sheet-russias-kidnapping-and-re-education-of-ukraines-children/) thousands of Ukrainian children. It seemed rather obvious that Trump wanted the war to end not because he was outraged by Putin’s vicious and vile assault on democracy and decency but so he would be free to work with the Russian autocrat for whom he has expressed admiration for over a decade.\"\n\n\"In 2013, when Trump announced he would be staging his Miss Universe contest in Moscow—a venture that would earn him several million dollars thanks to the event being underwritten by a Putin-friendly oligarch—he asked, via a [tweet](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/347191326112112640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E347191326112112640%7Ctwgr%5Eb1b2e8f1ba4e986ee37c298dee23fa2466b4ab2c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics-news%2Fdonald-trumps-tweet-best-friend-939986%2F), if Putin, who at that point was ratcheting up his repressive ways, would “become my new best friend?” When he was in Moscow for the pageant, Trump, who had long chased deals in Russia (and who had attracted Russian money for his various business projects), was [obsessed with meeting with Putin](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/russian-connection-what-happened-moscow-inside-story-trump-obsession-putin-david-corn-michael-isikoff/). No tete-a-tete transpired. In subsequent years, he often hailed the Russian (“strong,” “smart”), and he periodically sought to develop a Trump tower in Moscow—a project he secretly pursued while running for president in 2016. (His personal attorney, Michael Cohen, even sought assistance from Putin’s office for the deal, which eventually fizzled.)\"\n\n\"For nine years, Trump has done a masterful job of suppressing what was perhaps the most important story of the 2016 race: Moscow attacked the US election to assist Trump, and Trump and his crew aided and abetted that assault by denying it was happening. With his relentless ranting about “Russia, Russia, Russia,” the “Russia hoax,” and the “witch hunt”—propaganda enthusiastically embraced and loudly amplified by right-wing media and GOP leaders—Trump has essentially erased from public discourse Putin’s successful subversion of an US election and Trump’s own traitorous complicity.\"\n\n\"As Trump seeks to implement autocratic and corrupt rule in the United States, his dealings with Putin are likely to be complex and, perhaps, erratic. He hates Zelenskyy. He admires Putin. He wants the war to go away. He foolishly promised he could make that happen in 24 hours. He doesn’t know what to do, and Putin, still aiming to crush a democratic Ukraine, is not helping. The known history between the two—and there could be important aspects that are unknown—is complicated and still puzzling. But as pundits, politicians, and voters assess how Trump is faring with all this, they ought to keep foremost in mind that he’s sitting in the White House partly because of Putin’s skullduggery. That’s the original sin of the Trump presidencies, and many in Ukraine and America are bearing its consequences.\"",

It has brought some relief to Ukraine and talks are expected yo continue, but peace is not on the horizon either in Ukraine nor in the Middle East.  \n\nOnly one thing is certain, Trump's bond or enmity with friends and foes tend to inconsistent and rarely long lasting.

You take them at face value, give them what you think they said they wanted, and then all of a sudden, everything changes. That's part of the process to keep you moving around and psychologically uncomfortable. All you have to do is stay steady with what you want and if they meet it, great and if they don't you keep going. That throws them off. Of course, they'll bluster, threaten, but you stay steady because that's the only way that you can get to your objective.

As far as being a negotiator on behalf of the United States (ie. the actual job of a president) it would never occur to Trump to value that outcome, especially if it interfered with his own benefit.\n\nIt's not that Trump tries to get good deals for America and fails, it's that it would literally never cross his mind to even try achieving that. This is why I'm sure he won't ultimately do anything to harm Putin: there's too much mutually-beneficial dealmaking at stake to risk rocking that boat.

They cannot accept losing even one hand in the game...

        "body": "Trump is having to come to terms with reality after glorifying and defending Putin for years; desperately hoping for his cooperation in return.\n\nBut because Trump now recognizes that brokering a peace will be far more complicated and difficult than he previously imagined, he's become outraged over the fact that he won't be handed a \"win\" and entitled to some kind of accolade for his feckless efforts.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump cares far more about being awarded for his efforts than he does about actually ending the war.\n\nThat said, Trump promised to end the war on \"day one,\" but during his first call with Putin, they chatted about their \"shared history\" and discussed how Trump could help Putin realize his goals and assist Russia in seizing control of a large chunk of Ukrainian land.\n\nImmediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a \"dictator\"\n\nTrump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies publicly denigrated Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership for weeks, and without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.\n\nTrump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to \"negotiate\" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.\n\nTrump had the gall to call Zelensky a \"dictator without elections,\" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.\n\nThe truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.\n\nEvery \"deal\" he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.\n\nHe even previously called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" \n\nTrump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO. This move would only weaken the alliance; effectively carrying out one of Putin's most ambitious goals for him.\n\nTrump has practically enabled Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.\n\nTrump has defended Putin for years, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a \"killer\" who murders his political opponents.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over abandoned US military outposts.\n\nTrump ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed these forces to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.\n\nAnd let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after he demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are crucial for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.\n\nAnd look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been Putin's personal backscratcher and useful idiot for years, but what's really irritating right now is how Trump cares very little about the war and its ramifications, and is far more concerned about how he can take credit for negotiating a lukewarm deal at best.\n\nHe's desperate to be awarded the title of \"peacemaker,\" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, straining our alliances, and offering up Ukraine's territory to Russia with no real security guarantees in return.\n\nHe'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.\n\nPutin is a dangerous expansionist on a warpath to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.\n\nTrump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, only to later resume a freshly organized and newly equipped \"special military operation\" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.\n\nPutin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.\n\nFor Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, half-hearted and temporary deal is made.",

More sanctions on Russia, reversing his stance on aid to Ukraine, etc. That he doesn't do it just makes it weakness even worse. However, I wonder if there are internal factors in his Admin at play here, stopping him from doing what he wants. He seems to be more of a puppet and front face of the far-right than the active leader of it he seemed to be in the first term, you know what I mean? \n\nOr, it could be as simple as dementia making him angry and lash out at *everything*, I dunno.",

We lost 6 months in Ukraine like terrible months. And our defence industry did a trillion in revenue last year for the first time, this year they've lost 40% market cap. \n\nWe were making 3-5x returns on this, and we could be making a lot more if we actually taxed companies you know?  If we had just an average corporate tax rate that would be 300 billion for taxpayers, every year.\n\nAnd this was not simply linear growth, because we had all the cash in lendlease while everyone donatee Soviet surplus and buying new stuff from us, but he somehow managed to ruin 8 years of backdated procurement orders. Worth trillions. Like ten trillion. For real. We had the most orders for current gen fighters and patriots systems and ammo and electronic warfare infrastructure etc on the books through 2035 then we have ever had. Our very bad industry which also employs a lot of people was going to double. \n\nWhen trump was like arguing with macron about oh we sent x amount of money and he's like yeah we did too, and trump didn't believe him.  Yes, Europe did send more than us except we only sent military aid and a big portion of that was lendlease. They sent financial aid and food and stuff. Because 'military aid' is the up up down down left right left right select start cheat code that allows this incomprehensible bag of jelly of a country to keep oozing forward.\n\nNone of this is counting the incredible amount of lng we were exporting, and all of the new  jobs and infrastructure we got processing the stuff and  building them lng ports. Now if we could tax this better or owned at least some of it it could pay for everything we would ever need forever, put every kid in college get everybody health care. But it sure as hell doubled our exports and decoupled our allies from our adversary. \n\nIf you claim that you want to build manufacturing and make America safe, I'm not clear how destroying the defense industry plays into that. We are the best at making things that kill people, presumably this is good for our security. One assumes, I'm not a doctor or anything, but if my leg fell off I'd probably figure out where I should go. \n\n There is nothing pleasant about this infinite money glitch Biden was running.   But failing to understand that America it's getting $3-5 out for every dollar in, this infantile idea of 'losing money' is such a ridiculous reason to collapse. He really thought the president of China and Russia respected him that's how absolutely pathetic he is. \n\nI know the empire will fall but can we do it like with some fkn dignity?  Can we fall at least keeping like at least three of our promises. So many Ukrainians died and fought because we said we would support them until the end. It's a disgrace. The only thing we have that was even marginally defensible was that we were giving them hope and a way to fight. Pulling this away after half a million of them died is like the worst thing. Another century defining horror losing the only silver lining is that we were legitimately helping. \n\nGaza is a century defining injustice with no silver lining and most of that is on Biden still, but it's starting to add up for Trump. What trump did did the kurds was unjustifiable. Giving all those venezuelan's blanket TPS status to get a good photo op of owning madura and then deporting all of them his first day of back in office. Everything he does is either evil or stupid.  We have like 87 horrific things and three okay things and one good thing so like can we please collapse with those three good things still being there please. \n\nI wanna go down with like some morals. What was the point of the 300 if we simply collapse because we elected an infant who thinks a world leader jingling keys in his face means they respect him.",

It’s hard to admit you’re wrong, and low information propaganda guzzling rubes have been sold a lie by paid for bad actors and influencers telling them that Russia was the good guy all along. That Ukraine somehow deserved what they got, because Ukraine was a paid for part of the democratic deep state, not the nazi bullshit that Russia is pedaling to its own citizens. So when dear leader got in and couldn’t tame Putin (surprise, surprise) and couldn’t negotiate a deal to stop the war. Now Trump has turned against Putin because he knows we’re on a collision course for world war 3, and Putin cut the breaks. It’s easier to believe that the man in the Oval Office has been given the wrong information than admit that you’ve been a stooge to a Russian disinformation campaign that has been a rousing success.",

But I have the knack for it and I have studied it.  \n   \nIntelligence is a term up for debate now more than ever, as we find out more animals are more intelligent than we previously thought, just in different ways. But it all boils down to using the resources available to you in creative ways to achieve as good results as possible. Or at lest do your best to try. Choosing to use your resources to cause deliberate harm and not achieve the best outcome if you used those resources in other ways is not what I'd call intelligent. It is cunning. Being sly and calculating for nefarious goals.  \n   \nFor the sake of argument - yes, Putin is smarter than Trump. But that'd be similar as saying a crow is smarter than a snake. Sure, those two individuals are intelligent, when compared to most animals. But when compared to humans with more knowledge and far-sightedness, these two are only cunning. Meaning, you could say they are intelligent in manipulation, doing evil shit and serving no-one but themselves. Cunning.  \n   \nHumans have enough intelligence to look at benefits longer-term and wider scope than what a crow does with a stick or rocks to keep it fed for the time being. And when humans do as the crow does... well, that's a stark reminder that we are still animals and not THAT much better than other animals, since we're prone to those same instinctual mechanisms, although we should have the capacity to shackle them and use our theoretically superior brain to cause as much benefit to as many as possible.  \n   \nSadly, it is exactly cunning that tends to land people in positions of power, because those with intelligence usually do not want to harm others to get their way.  \n   \nFor simplicity's sake let's just say I call \"intelligent\" someone who is both smart and emotionally mature. And \"cunning\" someone who is smart but emotionally corrupt.

        "body": "President Donald Trump had furious words for Vladimir Putin after a wave of attacks on Ukraine — but not much else.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump[ said his Russian counterpart had “gone absolutely CRAZY”](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-calls-putin-vance-russia-doesnt-know-how-to-end-war-3701711?srsltid=AfmBOoowXMMw55Nqonr5dgg1tGjUJmdV_w6gPI-Y7LhFy0UF6N8yMy5S&amp;ico=in-line_link) in launching a deadly wave of air strikes.\n\nIt was his harshest criticism yet of Putin, whom Trump has tried with little success to push into agreeing [a ceasefire with Ukraine.](https://inews.co.uk/news/trump-calls-putin-vance-russia-doesnt-know-how-to-end-war-3701711?ico=in-line_link)\n\nWhat his response lacked, though, was the type of clear consequence, which Ukraine and other Western countries have consistently argued is the only way to alter Putin’s approach.\n\nTrump made no mention of military aid or increased pressure to negotiate.\n\nIn response to a reporter’s question earlier on Sunday, Trump said he would “absolutely” consider further sanctions, but seemed to drop the idea by the time of his Truth Social post.\n\nIn the hours that followed, Russia responded with another sweeping attack on Ukraine. Kyiv said it was hit with 355 drones and 9 cruise missiles from Sunday night into Monday, among the largest salvos of the war.\n\nIt seemed to illustrate that Trump’s warnings had done little to moderate Putin’s attacks.\n\nIn comments on Monday morning, the Kremlin defended its strikes as legitimate and said Trump has might be experiencing “emotional overload.”\n\nIt said it would keep engaging in the peace process championed by Trump, but had no deadlines in mind, perhaps calling to mind [fears Trump voiced last month](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/real-putin-clear-trump-hope-easy-peace-deal-3665441?srsltid=AfmBOoqoumK8VJ1TrDetk1WwjygdDx4vBsOzKjPVEqapvmajckU8Iwth&amp;ico=in-line_link) that Putin “doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.”\n\nSeven of the largest drone and missile strikes during the war have now come since January 2025, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), undermining Trump’s claim that his re-entry to the White House would be a force for peace.\n\nPutin is also strengthening his grip on the front lines as fighting intensifies and Russian forces advance in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces are advancing at an average of roughly 14.3 square kilometres per day in Ukraine, the ISW estimates, albeit at the cost of an average 1,500 Russian casualties a day.\n\nThe weekend strikes proved too much for some even within Trump’s usually-loyal Republican Party.\n\n“It is a time for honesty,” Congressman Don Bacon from Nebraska wrote on X as the Russian assault continued.\n\n“Peace talks are having zero effect on Putin. His goal is to dominate Ukraine &amp; he won’t stop until he realises he cannot win.”\n\nHe called on the US and the West to “arm Ukraine to the teeth” and “sanction Russia to the max”.\n\nRead more on i: [https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-is-showing-cant-believe-luck-despite-trump-3714269](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-is-showing-cant-believe-luck-despite-trump-3714269)",

The woman went on about how Trump was shaking up the negotiations on Ukraine, Gaza and Iran all at the same time, and the interviewer seemed impressed for some reason. He said something to the effect that if Trump's shock tactics work and all these parties are forced to negotiate, Trump might become the most successful peacemaker ever. I rolled my eyes. And then the analyst lady started to talk about how Trump was hiring these super bright tech people that were going to fix everything. This was around the time Elon's DOGE kids were doxxed. \n\nI'm Finnish, and the conversation reminded me of a saying my dad used to say, which translates roughly as \"if I get this and that, then I'm only missing three out of five\". Meaning, I actually have fuck all together. Cut to the big surprise: Putin does not want peace and keeps bombing, Netanyahu kept bombing and is now committing forced relocation of the people of Gaza, which is a war crime, Iran is continuing as ever, and general genius Elon Musk has crashed Tesla and been thrown out of the White House (performatively at least).",

The fact that US took a leading role in development and production of military equipment has made it very prosperous for US to supply Europe when it was needed while still hold a big arsenal. Now that will change: Trump is reducing the amount of money spent on US military in the fiscal budget, which ultimately is a HUGE economic sector and business in US, which now will slowly but surely move their business to Europe instead because there's money on the market here. They are businessmen, and they're loyal to money. \n\nIn the end you're left with an incompetent leader, a shattered alliance and a stronger enemy. For nothing in return.",

        "body": "Maybe, it depends on how you see things. I do believe the US global image is a big factor that lends into the US acting as the world police. However the world (just like any individual) eventually gets tired of police forces, especially foreign ones. (Sometimes rightfully so because of corruption, corporate interests etc.) So the US gets a lot of blame for things when they “meddle in” or supply arms like you say i.e palestine/israel. So the country is put in a tough position, it gets critiqued for getting involved, it gets critiqued for not getting involved. Its a lose lose situation for us entirely. So cutting back on military spending and allowing other allied nations to increase theirs and pick up the small growth allows for the country itself to be able to refinance some of its sectors. The US needs to restructure their spending and the culture needs to shift with it as well. Europe has the biggest problem to deal with which is Communism in Russia and its own birthing problem as well. Doesn’t make a lot of sense for the USA to go far reaching halfway across the board when we deal with our own issues as well. Especially considering how much Europe depends on Russia for its natural resources etc. Which basically puts the USA in a weird dynamic where its like a parent telling their daughter not to go out with their toxic boyfriend because he abuses her, but she reluctantly continues to do so. Every-time the USA steps in we get put in the “your evil” by both parties and leaves the USA as the person solely wasting their resources and efforts on something that inadvertently is Europes own problem. As much as we are an ally we are also our own individual country with our own faults and problems of our own. If almost 100 years of being allies and friends seizes to stop because we cant help out in this instance or for couple of instances, then it seems like the relationship is one sided.",

It is however not a smart thing to go on your own and become isolationist. And yeah, it is tough to deal with conflicts going on in the world, which is kind of why most of us looked at the statements coming from Trump to begin with as bogus. We knew he couldn't bring anything to the table, and now he is running away from a problem he has created all by himself. The war was always going to happen, regardless of him. He has done nothing to show for. I get that it ruins a lot to have your \"foot in two lairs\" but thats the price you have to pay for taking such a position. And it isn't as easy to say \"Now we're done policing, your problem now\" when you kind of created the balance of the situation to begin with after WW2. Stepping down is OK, but stepping down with no plan for anyone to take over is reckless because it puts a target on your own back. \n\nFirst of all, communism isn't a problem in Europe and hasn't been ever since 1989 and even then communism wasn't really a problem. The problem has always been authoritarianism, regardless of what social economic side of the spectrum they'd take. We had a lot of democracies fight one another her in Europe. Most of the developed nations in Europe today has a mixed model with core principles from mercantilism and capitalism and the good ol' social economics from Marxism mixed with modernised democratic and civil policies. At the time they were implemented and developed the geopolitical structure of Europe was already a solid foundation. Communism was just bolsjeviks taking it a step too far, and they were destroyed by Stalin who took it into another direction. The \"fear\" of communism has always been an American talking point. Here in Europe it was really never an issue, and still isn't. The birthing problem is not a part of this at all, and is actually a huge social problem in the entire world, including US. \n\nLets not talk about toxic relationships. We fought with US in the first gulf war, the Afghan war and the Iraq war, and the liberation of Libanon. Those were fought as allies, not because we wanted but because of the mutual alliance. If we were able to choose not to, we would and you can't change the rules now. If US won't help because you were occupied with your own internal conflicts, Europe will move forward dealing with their internal conflicts, and deal with Russia in Ukraine without US. But it will stain the alliance, and it will leave US much more vulnerable because of it. If you've been taught that the alliance has been a one-way relationship, you should do your due diligence to make sure you understand that it is of course not true. We've been co-depent.",

He'll be back to trying to negotiate a peace deal by the weekend, when his jealousy of Obama's Nobel Prize rises to the top of his addled brain again, but with each day of chaos and idiocy that passes he wrecks more of the US's economy and soft power... \n\nAnd Russia continues to make gains in Ukraine and run the Ukrainian's exhausted manpower reserves down more and more. Putin just needs to stall for time and he *knows* it. Why should Putin care that Trump is making dumb comments on Twitter, except to quietly rejoice at what another sign of a stupendously dumb and self inflicted wound Trumpism was to the West...?\n\nAnd no amount of propaganda or treating war like a team sport on Reddit helps; no amount of \"ha ha we beat Russia with our spare weapons\" nonsense changes the facts that the US is falling into 1940s Germany, with a desperately unwell, ranting at imaginary bogeymen Fuhrer, *and none of the Reddit resistance is doing anything real to even save themselves*. Except maybe post more \"Russian Troll!\" comments, thus subtly suggesting that even *they* think Russia is all powerful...\n\nOr indeed, actually making it worse; let's vote Reform into power in the UK! Brexit was such a resounding success after all, let's have more of that!\n\nPutin is evil, a vicious dictator and organised crime boss; but he's not crazy. And that drives Trump crazy because he wishes he could be that successfully evil, because even as he loots the US dry it's never enough because he knows he's not feared, or darkly respected like Putin. Everyone *knows* Trump is a moron, including Trump. Meanwhile, we continue to blow our own feet off whilst impotently tut-tutting the latest Trump nonsense. And telling ourselves he's also right that Russia will fall. Any day now. Just like for the last 3 years. Any day now. We sent Abrahms. We sent missiles. We sent F-16s.

        "body": "But Trump keeps bragging about his beautiful phone calls with Putin!\n\nTrump promised to end the war on \"day one,\" but during his first call to Putin, they chatted about their \"shared history\" and discussed how Trump could help Russia seize control of one-fifth of Ukraine's land. \n\nImmediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a \"dictator\"\n\nTrump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies went on for weeks denigrating Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.\n\nTrump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to \"negotiate\" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.\n\nTrump had the gall to call Zelensky a \"dictator without elections,\" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.\n\nThe truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.\n\nEvery \"deal* he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.\n\nHe even called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" \n\nTrump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely. And if you're not aware, weakening NATO is one of Putin's most ambitious goals. \n\nTrump has practically glorified Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.\n\nTrump has defended Putin throughout his presidency, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a \"killer\" who murders his political opponents.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over US military outposts that Trump had abandoned.\n\nTrump also effectively ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed them to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.\n\nAnd let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after Trump demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are a crucial supply for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.\n\nAnd look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been a long-standing ally and useful idiot to Putin, but what's especially concerning right now is how Trump cares next to nothing about \"ending the war\" in Ukraine, and cares far more about getting the credit for it.\n\nHe wants nothing more than to be awarded the title of \"peacemaker,\" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, weakening our alliances, and offering up a large chunk of Ukraine's territory to Russia with no specific security guarantees in return.\n\nHe'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.\n\nPutin is a dangerous expansionist on a campaign to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.\n\nTrump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, all so he can later resume a freshly organized and equipped \"special military operation\" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.\n\nPutin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.\n\nFor Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",

Nothing coming out of the Kremlin tells us anything other than it's their intention to progress this war to its fullest to take over the whole of Ukraine and eradicate Ukrainian identity and culture, even if that means killing millions of Ukrainians in the process.* That is the message in their media and that is the message from their politicians.** And you yourself are ridiculed.*** \n\nMake no mistake; there is no intention on Russia’s part to end this war. Therefore the only way to end it is to force Putin to stop attacking Ukraine and remove his forces from the country. That can only be achieved by arming Ukraine so that they can defend themselves and repel Russia's invasion, and by reducing Russia ability to finance the war through increased sanctions.\n\nFailure to act will see the brutal subjugation of an ally whose soldiers died alongside America’s in the Iraq war, followed by a war crime of the proportions we haven't seen since the Nazi crimes of World War 2. And the world will see you, and America, as complicit in that.\n\nAs for your fear of nuclear war, Putin relies on your fear to get you to do his bidding. The question is, is it a genuine threat or a bluff? We cannot know for certain, but I would ask, if Putin was prepared to use nuclear weapons to win this war, why hasn’t he already?\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zClrdGzC2yA&amp;list=PLLWQyEN3YRo7bpdyPlWscpvx2O8qSu0T1&amp;index=47\n\n*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5yvjyJdDW0&amp;list=PLLWQyEN3YRo7bpdyPlWscpvx2O8qSu0T1&amp;index=75\n\n**https://youtu.be/TfGk1MDMyXc?t=188\n\n***https://youtu.be/qyLe88A9MRY?t=88\n\nEdit: word.",

He does not care at all. He knows nothing would happen.\n\nRead OPs article. It's very informative, and it will (hopefully) stop people from believing the ridiculous myth.\n\nThe article is something everyone should read to get a true idea on what Trump is all about.",

In both instances, North Korea played Rice and the State Department for fools, constantly promising to stop production of enriched uranium in exchange for US concessions. First it was removing the DPRK from the state-sponsors of terrorism list, then it was releasing 25 million USD worth of assets back to them (via a Russian bank proxy no less as even China was reluctant to facilitate such a massive concession), then they ran-out the clock with them, inevitably leading to Obama's continuous difficulties navigating the situation across his term (which he speaks to in his memoirs as well, essentially concurring with Cheney that the State Department massively underestimated the DPRK's political maneavuring). Cheney - though I thought some of his memoir's chapters were padded with patriotic fluff, or outright lacking substantive detail - did also provide some pretty prophetic warnings about Putin, saying he saw an \"old hand of the KGB\" in him and never once trusted him, that Putin was desperate ('longed') to return ('turn back the clock') to the oppositional geopolitics of the Cold War and exert Russia's influence over the former Soviet Republics. Can't help but wonder how many of Cheney's 'colleagues' still remaining in Congress see the current state of the US State and Defense departments and are thinking just what the hell has become of the USA.",

Trump would like nothing better, especially now that he has a good taste of it (US tech oligarchs lining up to fund the inauguration and to visit Mar-a-Lago).\n\nOn the other hand, Trump wants to claim that he accomplished peace in Ukraine.

Like it's the most stupid idea and all it will do is spread nuclear fallout all over the place, but the guy probably thinks he has the best ideas ever.\n\n&gt;Some politicians go whichever way the wind blows. Not, however, the US’s esteemed leader, Donald Trump. He is such a force of nature that he can dictate the direction of the wind. During his first term, he suggested “nuking hurricanes” to stop them from hitting the country. A few weeks after that, Trump seemed to think he could alter the course of Hurricane Dorian with a black marker, scribbling over an official map to change its anticipated trajectory in an incident now known as Sharpiegate. Weirdly, Dorian did not end up following Trump’s orders. Hurricanes can be uncooperative like that.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/04/trump-waging-war-weather-forecasters-nuke-hurricanes",

The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis.”\n\nHe also refused to support the US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire, a key element of Monday’s phone call.\n\n[Russia’s requests, including taking Crimea and Donbas ](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trump-and-putins-call-opens-the-door-to-talks-but-in-ukraine-the-fighting-will-go-on-3703068?ico=in-line_link)and keeping Ukraine out of Nato, have been repeatedly rejected by Kyiv.\n\nTrump also reverted to his previous threat of walking away.\n\nHe told reporters in the Oval Office: “I think something’s going to happen and, if it doesn’t I’d just back away and they have to keep going. This was a European situation. It should have remained a European situation.\n\n“This is not my war.”",

Let the process begin!” he posted on Truth Social.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said leaders had welcomed the pontiff’s offer, and that “Italy is ready to do its part to facilitate contacts and work for peace.”\n\nPope Leo, the first US leader of the global Catholic Church, has previously said the Vatican could act as a mediator in global conflicts.\n\n“The Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face-to-face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace,” he said last week.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman said Moscow was aware of the Pope’s offer but that the issue of the Vatican “was not discussed in specifics” during the phone call.\n\nTrump was also questioned by reporters as to whether holding talks at the Vatican meant the US was stepping away – a suggestion he denied.\n\n“No, no, no, I think it would be great to have at the Vatican, perhaps it would have some extra significance,” he said. ",

It is clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but, of course, the devil is in the details,” the RIA agency quoted him as saying.\n\nEuropean leaders and Ukraine have demanded Russia agree to a ceasefire immediately, and Trump has focused on getting Putin to commit to a 30-day truce.

But there could be a time where that’s going to happen.”",

I still remember watching the interview he did at the National Association of Black Journalists (the one where he claimed that Kamala wasn't black) and one part that stood out to me was when he talked about inflation.\n\nHe actually acknowledged that deflation is much worse than inflation (which it is), so actually lowering prices is off the table. Weirdly, no one ever quoted him on that. He basically admitted in that moment that all of this talk about \"lowering prices\" was just straight up lies.\n\nAnd then he said something that was so idiotic that i don't even know how to respond to that. Basically he said that the true inflation rate was much worse than we think, because some things like interest rates aren't accounted in it. Interest rates are the primary tool used to curb inflation. That means that they are inversely correlated. Low interest rates lead to high inflation and vice versa.\n\nSo either he doesn't know how inflation works, OR he is lying to justify lowering interest rates. Because for billionaires like him, low interest rates are a dream. He doesn't give a fuck about inflation, he just wants to enrich himself. And he isn't even particularly subtle about it.\n\nThen again, why would he?",

        "body": "\n(Article)\n\n---\n\n\nThis Ukraine peace summit has not yet turned into the spectacular win Donald Trump hoped for. While Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to Turkey, as suggested by Vladimir Putin last week, the Russian leader is nowhere to be seen.\n\nThis meeting will not, therefore, provide a springboard to a Nobel Peace Prize which Trump so desperately craves, to match Barack Obama. As with his mediation with Israel over Gaza, which the US President glossed over during his glittering meetings with Arab leaders this week, it is all proving too difficult.\n\nAs a result, Trump is slinking away from his boasts that he could sort out two of the world’s major conflicts “alone” and on “day one”. That could be very good news for Ukraine if it finally kills the fading bromance between Trump and Putin. It means the United States may revert to where it was before the Trump 2.0 whirlwind: grudgingly sticking with its allies over the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n\nA few days ago, after Putin suggested meeting Zelensky in Turkey, Trump backed the Russians on social media: “President Putin of Russia doesn’t want to have a Cease Fire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey to negotiate a possible end to the BLOODBATH. Ukraine should agree to this IMMEDIATELY.”\n\nUnder pressure from the White House, the Ukrainian President agreed to turn up without preconditions. This flattered Trump, with whom the Ukrainian leader had already started to rebuild relations after the low of his Oval Office ambush. Zelensky was essential in helping the President grab the headlines at the Pope’s funeral, with the full consent of the Vatican, by pow-wowing with him in full view of the cameras.\n\nBut Putin didn’t turn up on Thursday, and Zelensky described the strikingly low-level Russian delegation fielded as a “theatre prop” and “a sham”. No Putin, no foreign minister Sergey Lavrov; the team is instead officially headed by an obscure former culture minister called Vladimir Medinsky.\n\nIt now appears that the Russian President set up these peace talks in the hope of humiliating Zelensky. Had he turned up, the Russian would have been meeting the Ukrainian as an equal. That never seemed likely, and the Kremlin has been quick to mock Zelensky as a “clown” and a “loser”. The most likely scenario is that these talks will not result in a ceasefire but relatively minor agreements, such as the exchange of prisoners of war.\n\nUntil Air Force One heads back to the US, there is still a chance that the diplomatic sparring could result in the sort of headline-grabbing drama Trump loves. He said today that he still might go to Istanbul this week, where delegations from Ukraine and Russia are due to meet to discuss ceasefire plans.\n\nThat would put him back on centre stage. As he told reporters accompanying him: “Nothing is going to happen until Putin and I get together.” Speaking in Qatar, he held back on criticising the Russians’ no-show today, mumbling: “I don’t think he’s going to go if I don’t go.”\n\nA few months ago, comments from Trump, JD Vance and others suggested that the new US administration had swallowed Russia’s propaganda that Zelensky and his government could be brushed aside. Some even dismissed Zelensky as a “dictator”. No longer.\n\nThere is no doubt that Trump’s patience with Putin is fraying. Trump’s Secretary of State Marco Rubio is attending a Nato foreign ministers meeting in Antalaya, Turkey, at which the UK’s David Lammy declared, “We come with one message to stand by Ukraine and ensure that we get a just and lasting, enduring peace.”\n\nThe most likely outcome of this week’s drama is that the US will continue to supply and support Ukraine militarily and move towards tougher sanctions on Russia, unless Putin comes to the table with concessions on Russia’s maximalist demands.\n\nMost importantly, Zelensky and Ukraine remain an equal in this great game – he has not been squeezed out by the vanity of the US President or the machinations of the Russian leader.",

Don’t call me Krasnov.  Can I just say, you’re looking strong. Really strong. Probably the strongest leader anywhere. Some people say I’m strong too but you, you’re next level. Honestly, I wish I had generals like yours. The Pentagon is full of losers.\n\nPresident Putin:\nYou are too kind. I believe we have matters to discuss — Ukraine, primarily.\n\nMr. Trump:\nYes, yes — the Ukraine thing. Listen, I think we should do a ceasefire. A beautiful ceasefire. The best ceasefire. Nobody knows ceasefires like I do.\n\nPresident Putin:\nIs that so? And what terms would you propose, Mr. Trump?\n\nMr. Trump:\nWell, obviously, it has to be bigly. Bold. Maybe just you say, “It’s paused,” and boom, it’s paused. Tremendous optics. I’ll even tweet it — or, Truth it — “Victory Through Strength™.” Sound good?\n\nPresident Putin:\nInteresting approach. I shall consider your suggestion. What would be the incentive for Russia?\n\nMr. Trump:\nEasy. I tell NATO it’s your idea. They’ll freak out. That’s leverage. Plus — and this is just between us Vlad — I’ve always thought Crimea had great real estate potential. Resort quality. So underappreciated!\n\nPresident Putin:\nYou continue to surprise me.\n\nMr. Trump:\nVlad, I’m just saying — I’d live in Russia. Absolutely. You’ve got class. You’ve got bears. No woke generals. Honestly, Mar-a-Lago Siberia? That could be a thing.\n\nPresident Putin:\nYou are welcome to visit. I will have a dacha prepared. Possibly near Lake Baikal.\n\nMr. Trump:\nA dacha! Beautiful. You know, I’ve always loved your palaces — the marble, the chandeliers. Not like Delaware. Total dump.  I can help you build a wall in Lake Baikal, Vlad. Nobody builds walls better than me. I’ll even draw you a diagram — very classy, very high, with gold trim. Maybe I can ask Ivanka to help.\n\nPresident Putin:\nWe build the best walls Mr Trump to the highest standards. A wall... with gold trim. I like that idea a lot.\n\nMr. Trump:\nAnd can I get one of those shirtless horseback calendars? Just asking. For the golf locker.\n\nPresident Putin:\nDa, It will be sent with expedited priority DHL.\n\nMr. Trump:\nThanks, That’s why I love you, Vlad. You get things done.  Best gift ever. I’m putting it up in Mar-a-Lago. Right next to the portrait of me hugging an eagle and my Bible.\n\nPresident Putin:\nYou mentioned Crimea's resort potential earlier. Do you have ideas beyond gold-trimmed walls?\n\nMr. Trump:\nOh, absolutely. Picture this: Trump Dacha &amp; Spa™ — five stars, beachfront, all-you-can-eat caviar bar. Tremendous value. I know property, believe me. And guess what? I’m bringing Florida oranges.\n\nPresident Putin:\nOranges?\n\nMr. Trump:\nYes — the best oranges. Very juicy. Not like your Russian ones. Do you even have oranges? Probably not. I could start a trade deal — Oranges for Oil. Think about it: \"Operation Vitamin C.\" Your soldiers could use the antioxidants.\n\nPresident Putin:\nThat is... unconventional. But we are always open to trade.\n\nMr. Trump:\nAnd listen — food diplomacy? Huge. You know what people love? Big Macs. I had McDonald’s in the White House. I personally served it. Historic moment. People loved it.\n\nPresident Putin:\nI recall the photographs of you wearing Macdonald hat.\n\nMr. Trump:\nExactly! I looked so good. Look — if you put a McDonald’s in Red Square, peace will follow. You know what they say: no one nukes where they eat nuggets.\n\nPresident Putin:\nIn Soviet times, that would have been treason. Now... it’s capitalism. Things evolve.\n\nMr. Trump:\nYou evolve well, Vlad. You’re like a Pokémon — strong, tactical, shirtless.\n\nPresident Putin:\nWhat is a Pokémon?\n\nMr. Trump:\nNever mind. The point is — I know power when I see it. And you’ve got it. You’re like the Steve Jobs of geopolitics, except with tanks instead of turtlenecks.\n\nPresident Putin:\nDa. Very... diplomatic. Good bye Donald. Much love to Melania.\n\nMr. Trump:\nGood bye Vladimir.\nSummary of Agreements:\n\nTrump to promote a symbolic ceasefire proposal via his media channels, pending Kremlin confirmation and changes.\nPutin to send limited-edition signed calendar and review availability of lakeside property in Eastern Siberia for honorary residency.\nNo actual ceasefire agreed upon, but both parties satisfied with tone of conversation.\nAction Items:\n\nItem\nResponsibility\nDraft ceasefire tweet with misspellings\nTrump Campaign Intern\nMail dacha brochures (Crimea annexed edition)\nKremlin Housing Authority\nDesign gold-accented Siberian wall\nTrump Jr. (unqualified but eager)\n \nMinutes Prepared By:\nUnnamed Kremlin Translator (Now Missing)",

He now says those claims were “sarcastic”, yet insisted last week that “nothing’s going to happen until Putin and I get together”.\n\nThe President was speaking after Putin failed to travel to Istanbul for talks with the Ukrainians that the Kremlin leader had personally proposed less than a week earlier.\n\nInstead, Moscow sent a low-level delegation to meet [Volodymyr Zelensky ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky?ico=in-line_link)that did not even include Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader, waiting on the banks of the Bosphorus, dismissed the Kremlin’s delegation as a “dummy” grouping. In turn, Moscow accused Zelensky of being a “pathetic loser clown”.\n\nThe resulting talks ended with an agreement for each side to swap 1,000 prisoners of war – [but no sign of a ceasefire, let alone an end to the war](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/detached-from-reality-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-finish-in-under-two-hours-3699702?ico=in-line_link).\n\nInto this morass, Trump now intends to reinsert himself, saying he will speak to Putin and Zelensky separately on Monday, as well as “VARIOUS MEMBERS OF NATO” – demonstrating the seriousness of the moment by employing all-caps on his Truth Social platform.\n\n“HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump said.",

Offering no evidence to back up his claim, he argued that Putin had abandoned plans to meet Zelensky because Trump himself was not going to attend the talks.\n\nBut having declared himself indispensable to the process, Trump runs the risk of a very public and damaging failure if he is unable to prod Putin in the direction of at least a 30-day ceasefire.\n\nSo far, the Kremlin leader has outpaced Trump at every turn, while Russian forces continue to unleash death and destruction on Ukraine.\n\nLast month, Trump used his social media account publicly to plead with Putin to embrace a ceasfire. “Vladimir, STOP!” he wrote, describing himself as “not happy with Russian strikes on Kyiv. Not necessary and very bad timing”. But Putin utterly disregarded the message.\n\nSeveral days later, Trump’s patience with the Russian leader appeared to be wearing even thinner.\n\n“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas,” he wrote. “It makes me think that he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently”.\n\nYet none of those messages has yet given rise to any change in Trump’s position, and he remains curiously credulous of Putin while constantly flaying Zelensky in public.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump again sounded far more sympathetic to Putin’s plight than to the suffering of Zelensky and his fellow Ukrainians. He angrily claimed that Zelensky had “pissed away” American assistance provided to Kyiv, and repeated entirely false claims that Ukrainian officials had stolen billions of dollars in aid.\n\nPressed over whether he will support fresh [sanctions on Russia ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sanctions-against-russia?srsltid=AfmBOorlwWCT8HCdtiGS3scNV16bhi97igllVft4QzDXSnrYQdnUoGXc&amp;ico=in-line_link)that are being proposed by Senate Republicans and European leaders, Trump demurred, and chose to leave all his options open.\n\n“Nobody uses leverage better than me,” he claimed, but then conceded that he would “rather not” impose more sanctions that would be “crushing for the Russian economy”.",

They have no empathy, no compassion, and no ability to feel the pain of what their actions and words do to other people. Therefore, they're both distractions. Zelenskyy and the rest of the world just have to keep doing what they're doing. Which is fighting aggression, fighting tyranny, and as much as they can ignore both Trump and Putin because all those two understand is when you fight back, and hit them with your best punch.

        "body": "One of the last times he called Putin, they chatted about their \"shared history\" and discussed how Trump could help Russia seize control of one-fifth of Ukraine's land. \n\nImmediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a \"dictator\"\n\nTrump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies went on for weeks denigrating Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.\n\nTrump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to \"negotiate\" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.\n\nTrump had the gall to call Zelensky a \"dictator without elections,\" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.\n\nThe truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.\n\nEvery \"deal* he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.\n\nHe even called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" \n\nTrump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely. And if you're not aware, weakening NATO is one of Putin's most ambitious goals. \n\nTrump has practically glorified Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.\n\nTrump has defended Putin throughout his presidency, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a \"killer\" who murders his political opponents.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over US military outposts that Trump had abandoned.\n\nTrump also effectively ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed them to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.\n\nAnd let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after Trump demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are a crucial supply for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.\n\nAnd look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been a long-standing ally and useful idiot to Putin, but what's especially concerning right now is how Trump cares next to nothing about \"ending the war\" in Ukraine, and cares far more about getting the credit for it.\n\nHe wants nothing more than to be awarded the title of \"peacemaker,\" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, weakening our alliances, and offering up a large chunk of Ukraine's territory to Russia with no specific security guarantees in return.\n\nHe'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.\n\nPutin is a dangerous expansionist on a campaign to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.\n\nTrump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, all so he can later resume a freshly organized and equipped \"special military operation\" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.\n\nPutin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.\n\nFor Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",

And NWF should rize a lot during war due to various reasons I won't even attempt to summarize).\nBut Putin just broke the money banks by throwing a few oligarchs out the window. I'm afraid we're in for at least a year more.\nThough we have already seen some issues with money, and the new European batch of sanctions is having quite a bit of success, especially targeting Russia’s shadow fleet. Already, 2 tankers have been stopped. While it's clearly not a lot, it’s significant when you consider that it was done with only the draft of an idea for the sanction.",

Prisoner exchange never stopped. Those types of deals are easy. The hard part is Ukraine wants to keep its territories or at least not cede anything permanently. There is not going to be any peace under these circumstances. Russian chief negotiator said that if there is no peace now, the next time they are at the table it will be discussion about 8 Oblasts instead of 4 as it is doing now.\n\nThe only positive thing is they agreed to meet again with each side presenting a path forward towards a ceasefire.

And if so, on what terms? Or is his only plan to string the West along while he [continues fighting](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/putin-ignored-uk-eu-ceasefire-what-it-means-peace-ukraine-3688509?ico=in-line_link), still purely determined to not just weaken Ukraine but defeat it?\n\nThis might seem difficult to judge, when the Kremlin has even kept international leaders in the dark this week about whether Putin will attend the talks. Trump himself admitted on Wednesday morning that he still was not sure.\n\nMaintaining uncertainty is just one tactic in his wider strategy, according to Sir Laurie Bristow. He met the dictator several times while serving as the UK’s ambassador to Russia from 2016 to 2020.\n\n“Everything is a power game,” explains Bristow, saying Putin’s calculations are based on who he is facing and his ability to control them.",

He thinks he’s got a big opportunity to do that… \\[and\\] that the longer this conflict goes on, the more chance there is of Trump losing interest.”\n\nUndermining Zelensky, potentially provoking him into angering Trump in a repeat of their [explosive Oval Office meeting in February](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/three-astonishing-things-trump-said-to-zelensky-in-white-house-shouting-match-3560887?srsltid=AfmBOooSDc0OIentKQM45nlF4fn9q0Z-z6gaWP-LzOgCZzijHV9CySMo&amp;ico=in-line_link), “is probably Putin’s game this week”.\n\nHowever, the Russian president will be wary of humiliating Trump, according to the author Philip Short. He spent eight years researching every detail of the Russian leader’s life for his acclaimed biography [*Putin: His Life and Times*](https://www.waterstones.com/book/putin/philip-short/9781784700935).\n\n“He wants to persuade Trump that Zelensky is the guy who’s holding things up,” says Short. “He does not want Trump to turn against him and decide that the Russians are responsible for what’s happening – as of course they are.” It’s still conceivable that in this scenario, the White House would decide to back Ukraine after all.\n\nIf Putin does engage in diplomacy sincerely, his red lines seem obvious to the author. “He would not agree to Ukraine joining [Nato](https://inews.co.uk/topic/nato?ico=in-line_link), or the Europeans putting troops in to give security guarantees. He would want limits on the Ukrainian armed forces. These would all be very difficult for Zelensky to accept.”\n\nIt is now widely accepted by many Western diplomats that Russia is unlikely to be pushed back, at least in the coming months. They think Ukraine will have to sacrifice some or all of its occupied territory to secure a long-term peace deal that protects the rest of the country. “Everybody knows, at some point, this is going to have to finish with negotiations,” says Short.\n\nThat will require both sides to seek peace. And right now, neither expert believes that Putin has any genuine intentions of doing that.",

        "body": "# Why Putin wants to carry on fighting\n\nIn Putin’s mind, says Bristow, his forces are winning on the battlefield. There is quite simply no reason in his mind to stop fighting now.\n\n“In a [war of attrition](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/war-of-attrition-what-meaning-term-explained-what-happening-ukraine-russia-conflict-1529533?srsltid=AfmBOory57qKZ859uyRy1g7bkU0A5gyhCH5vcGRvZDVKle3l1fLND7sw&amp;ico=in-line_link), it’s about who loses first, not who wins.” If he can keep fighting for as long as possible, “Putin’s calculation, which I think is probably right, is that it’s Ukraine that loses first… Russia’s got a bigger economy, a much bigger population, and they can coerce the population in a way that Ukrainians can’t.\n\n“Russia’s army has been seriously damaged. They’ve taken enormous losses and they take more every day. The country now runs on a war economy and that will damage Russia’s long-term prospects profoundly. But none of that changes anything in Putin’s head… In his own mind, all the costs are worth it.”\n\nShort agrees that the Russian leader will believe his country can continue fighting “for quite some time to come. The threats of tougher [sanctions](https://inews.co.uk/topic/sanctions-against-russia?srsltid=AfmBOorlwWCT8HCdtiGS3scNV16bhi97igllVft4QzDXSnrYQdnUoGXc&amp;ico=in-line_link) probably won’t alter his calculations on that”.\n\nAs ever, Putin’s strategy all depends on “whether he thinks he can get away with it”, he says. And for the moment, he can.\n\nHis actions go beyond pragmatic considerations, however. It’s about his fundamental goals and ideology.\n\n“There is absolutely no sign whatsoever that he’s changed any of his objectives in the war,” says Bristow. “He does not believe that Ukraine should exist. He thinks it’s part of the Russian empire.”\n\nNo deal allowing any form of Ukrainian independence will quell the enduring sense of “Russian imperialism and resentment at the end of the Cold War”, which drove Putin to invade in the first place. “There’s a clear sense of his personal destiny being now inseparable from Russia’s destiny, and this is something that just has to happen.”\n\nShort agrees on this point. Putin still draws much of his strength from ultra-nationalists, he says. They might not have hungered for a war, especially such a long and deadly one, but they support its aims and will not accept a consolation prize, let alone defeat.\n\n“Do not underestimate the extent to which so many Russians really feel that Ukraine is part of their history, their identity, their culture, their religion,” says the biographer. “I remember people 30 to 40 years ago in Moscow saying to me: ‘It’s inconceivable that Ukraine should ever be independent, it’s ours.’”",

        "body": "This is why the Europeans have little faith that negotiations can work unless Russia is weakened.\n\n“Anyone who believes that Putin will keep an agreement that he signs is a fool. It just isn’t going to happen,” says Bristow.\n\n“In dealing with Putin, a ceasefire never ever means the ceasing of fire. What he’d seek to do is to play below the threshold of military action to his advantage: nibbling away at the principles, doing things that he can get away with without necessarily bringing the whole thing to collapse, eroding the position of the Ukrainians and eroding the position of the Americans and Europeans to support them.”\n\nPointing to what happened after the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Putin’s first partial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Bristow says: “You typically get a military provocation which doesn’t quite tip things back into outright warfare again, but incrementally improves Russia’s military and political position.”\n\nAnd beyond a temporary truce, no supposedly permanent settlement with Putin could be genuinely trusted, argues Bristow. In fact, it is possible he may never agree to one. “In my view, there isn’t going to be a final settlement of this conflict while Putin is alive, which could be another decade or so… The idea that simply trading land will buy you peace in Ukraine – that’s not going to happen.”\n\n# Concerns for the rest of Europe\n\nSome Eastern European nations – especially Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which all suffered terribly within the Soviet empire – worry what Putin will do if he secures any kind of victory in Ukraine, or at least a face-saving escape. Despite now being Nato members, they believe the Russian leader would want to invade them next.\n\nShort can understand those Baltic fears, after Putin has attacked one neighbour so “foolishly and stupidly”. Yet he believes the Russia president holds no such aspirations. “He’s not mad,” he explains. “I don’t see it happening in a million years. Attacking Nato directly is something that the Russians have been very careful not to do.”\n\nHe adds: “We’ve had all the European leaders and previously the Americans saying: ‘If we don’t stop him in Ukraine, then we’re going to be next.’ I really felt that was a very good way of winning popular support, of persuading British and American taxpayers they’ve got to fork out.”\n\nBristow firmly rejects this notion, insisting the dangers are real. “If he wins in Ukraine – by any definition – that is a direct and very serious threat to European and UK security… Russia would be the dominant military power in Europe.”",

But I don’t think there’s any prospect at all of peeling Russia and China apart. That’s total fantasy.”\n\nNevertheless, predicting Putin’s actions can be tricky when he is so insulated from the outside world. “Even if you’re a senior Russian official, you don’t on the whole get quality time with the man,” says Bristow. “He’s very isolated and hemmed around by a very tiny number of very close advisers.”\n\nThose around him are “true believers” who would not dare challenge the leader, he adds. “This is not a system where telling the boss he’s wrong is life-enhancing.”",

And especially the later, he talks about potential military force. Both are threats and war mongering. So, that's your \"peace\" president. On the same imperial line as Putin, the war starter and attacker.\n\nAnd in a more inner political sense, Trump is waging war on his own people. First, by dividing them. Second, by purposefully making their live worse through things like tariffs (living costs increase), by cutting public services, by limiting choices and rights, by violating the constitution, by not honoring the American institutions and checks and balances. He has received support and votes from less than half of the voting population (&lt;50%). So, the majority of people voted against him. This is no way a \"mandate\" that he talks about.",

Everyone should start preparing for the worst case scenario and take steps to start resisting a future authoritarian regime (not to sound accusatory towards the commenter, just hijacking the top comment for visibility).\n\nHere’s some ideas of things you can do in the short term if you’re unsure of what to do.\n\n- Join a mutual aid group. You can Google “mutual aid groups near me” or something like that. Start offering help with whatever you’re able to in order to start building a support network.\n- Join a protest, but more importantly make at least one connection with someone there (the more the merrier though). Similar to the mutual aid group, you want to start building a network of like minded individuals if shit starts getting more serious.\n- Learn a skill. First aid, sewing clothes, DIY home repair, etc. Learn and practice something that will be useful to a group if essential services become unavailable.\n- Get informed. Read books (and watch videos too, but I’d challenge you to stick to mediums that can’t be shut off or easily controlled) about how to resist an authoritarian regime. “On Tyranny” by Timothy Snyder is an easy to read and well structured book that also gives a lot of other sources you can refer to after you’re done., but just get yourself as informed as possible while hopefully weaning yourself from relying on the internet for information.\n- This one’s a bit controversial, but if you’re not opposed to arming yourself, start doing so and start stockpiling ammunition. Hit the practice range regularly and train. There’s a large community of liberal gun owners out there, but if you can’t find any, just train at the conservative places. Most places will generally leave to your own devices as long as you’re not actively starting trouble.",

The \"we create reality\" speech was chilling at the time.\n\nAnd then Reagan pretty much got away with whatever he wanted to get away with; as long as his folksy charm held out he was pretty much untouchable. Then Nixon, who is unique in having seen consequences. Then if you are looking for bad behavior committed in the US directed at citizens, you do have to go back aways, but if you are looking for criminality on the world stage, it's pretty blatant and common, though we rarely talk about it in the US. Something like 64 governments overthrown on US orders after WWII...and then of course we had a hand in a lot of rotten stuff between the wars, and before WWI there was a decided and openly talked about shift to imperialism, similar to what we had at the last election. The more you look the more you find. \n\nAnyway, if the US is sliding toward fascism and isolated nationalism, and the world is shifting toward more liberal governments to distance itself, it is possible to see a coherent long-term trend where all this was inevitable, and that it might be a very good thing that the veil is lifted and the world is waking up. Of course that's not the narrative you get in school, but the main reason it seems so unprecedented is how firmly the normal \"we're the good guys\" narrative is embedded in our psyches.\n\nAnd I'd add on edit - while most of the perpetrators on the list are GOP, and there was often strong resistance from the other side of the aisle, but almost never were heinous actions reversed when the opposition got back in. One example one of my history professors gave was about one of the worst things the US government ever did - the Indian Displacement Act, under Andrew Jackson (Trump's favorite president), which led to the Trail of Tears and all that. The Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, but Jackson didn't give a shit, and it all went forward anyway.

Trump doesn't write like this!!\n\n---\n\nNo matter what deal I make with respect to Russia/Ukraine, no matter how good it is, even if it's the greatest deal ever made, The Failing New York Times will speak BADLY of it. Liddle' Peter Baker, the very biased and untalented writer for The Times, followed his Editor's demands and wrote that Ukraine should get back territory, including, I suppose, Crimea, and other ridiculous requests, in order to stop the killing that is worse than anything since World War II. Why doesn't this lightweight reporter say that it was Obama who made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired. It was also Liddle' Peter who wrote an absolutely fawning, yet terribly written Biography, on Obama. It was a JOKE! Did Baker ever criticize the Obama Crimea Giveaway? NO, not once, only TRUMP, and I've had nothing to do with this stupid war, other than early on, when I gave Ukraine Javelins, and Obama gave them sheets. This is Sleepy Joe Biden's War, not mine. It was a loser from day one, and should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened if I were President at the time. I'm just trying to clean up the mess that was left to me by Obama and Biden, and what a mess it is. With all of that being said, there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through \"Banking\" or \"Secondary Sanctions?\" Too many people are dying!!!",

But a peace deal on its own, at least ones that are being discussed are not likely to be accepted or pan out. The way I see it here are my thoughts on the matter. \n\nPeace deal, current territorial gains kept, no additional arms or security guarantee: This gives both sides time to recover and re-arm. This does however greatly favour Russia as while their quality of arms may not be equal to the quality that Ukraine has been getting, even with Europe still supplying Ukraine though not as a whole bloc, Russia will likely still have the industry to re-arm at a faster rate especially if they continue receiving arms from China and North Korea. In addition to this, Putin has repeatedly shown that he is willing to ignore agreed upon treaties such as the Minsk agreement by using a combination of propaganda, misinformation and false flag operations. See, literally any other conflict Russia has started since the cold war. Even if US companies set up mining operations they will likely completely bypass these areas or again use false flags and blame Ukraine for any damage/casualties. \n\nAny other peace deal: Russia will never accept a deal which provides Ukraine with security guarantees from the EU/NATO/US. Nor will either side likely accept loss of territory. \n\nMy opinion on the best option: Personally, and I should note I have 0 background in economics or geopolitics, I think the best path to peace is further sanctioning Russia and implementing Tariffs (I know, I know) or sanctions on nations supporting or bypassing sanctions on Russia. This would be done over time to give time to the nations to find other sources for supply like oil. \n\nNegotiate with nations to further undercut Russian prices on resources like oil and gas prior to the above. Lastly, arm Ukraine to the teeth, Supply then with modern arms without restrictions. Russia has stated previously that redlines would lead to military actions on these countries who supplied arms such as f16s, tracks, etc but these have always resulted in nothing. As a safety barrier this can also be done incrementally though it must be at a much faster pace than it is currently. Especially for European nations as it is in their great interest as Russia has historically always been the biggest threat and continues to be. It should also be noted that this can have positive effects for these nations as they get better data on their arms usefulness as well as boosts their economy in the replacement and improvements on these arms. \n\nAgain I am no expert, these are my own thoughts and should not be taken at face value. I am not your general and this is not military advice 😅.\n\nAlso if you read all this guy grab a cookie or something you deserve it.",

Obviously, this would make it very easy for Putin to invade again a few years later (or perhaps even a few weeks), destroy more and take more.\n\nYou are also ignoring the fact that Russia has held Ukraine for centuries as a colony, and attempted to gradually genocide it away in the process of Russification in order to keep the land, through things like the Holodomor and deportations and by forbidding the Ukrainian language and culture.\n\nThe Ukrainian language is now forbidden again in the occupied territories, people and children are being deported to Russia proper, Ukrainian 18 year olds are being recruited by the Russian army to fight against Ukraine, people who resist are arrested and possibly tortured and Russians are encouraged to cheaply buy the houses left behind by refugees.\n\nDo you not care about all of this?

But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.\n\n&gt;The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.\n\n&gt;They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A.

More specifically, they hated how Communism cut their access to areas that used to be easy for them to exploit and pillage for cheap resources. They didn't like the decolonization that came with communism. This is the same group of people who overthrew dozens of elected governments in Central and South America because they were \"communists\" and installed mass murdering fascists in order to secure slave labor for fruit plantations. \n\nIt was never about Russia. It was about wanting control over the world and Russia just happened to be opposed to this due to their own economic needs and internal dogma. Now that Russia is aggressively capitalist, it was furtile ground for buying cheap resources and selling expensive finished goods as long as you passed a buck or two uptop for the mob bosses in charge. They've been pissed for decades that they're getting cut off from the Russian markets and resources and have been fighting like hell to get them back.",

I do always wonder why fake Christians claim to be believers when they’d get voted in whether they believed or not these days, but maybe there really is some part of them deep inside that believes. Trump is also very easily swayed from one side to the other, which is why he thinks he’s good at deal making - he does something atrocious, gets a shitty return on it as a compromise offer, then accepts it and thinks he’s done something amazing.

I was born last century, and until literally this year, I'd *thought* psychics as a profession had died out the century before that in the 1800s. \n\nI'd never seen one before so I'd just assumed that the idea of psychics existing as an actual profession in modern times was entirely made up for TV, which now that I check that is apparently deeply untrue, I mean, a [Vogue author wrote last year](https://www.vogue.com/article/why-do-people-become-addicted-to-psychics): \"**Most people I know** have at one point in their lives gone to see a psychic, astrologer, tea leaf reader, or medium.\"\n\nSo if this person, in 2025, has a social network in which the majority of people have paid money to have someone make specific predictions about their futures on the basis of storytelling about chance events, I think it really only stands to reason that a President might have one too.\n\nI think the weirder part is that he would want a pastor at all. He could have that every Sunday in a church, but he never goes there. So for Trump, the reason he picks a pastor without following through is probably because it's the easiest way to make a show of it without actually doing anything, although obviously that doesn't really address what you're saying; even if Trump's not one of them, for a lot of people in the modern world, spirituality *is* more than just for show.",

        "body": "Interesting portions of this analytical piece:\n\n&gt;The surface rationale is that megabusiness leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Marc Andreessen are safeguarding their companies and their shareholders’ interests. The underlying explanation is that America is being reborn as an oligarchy.\n&gt;\n&gt;This new class—with Trump megadonor Elon Musk as its self-appointed tribune—has thrown its support behind a libertarian economic agenda that maximizes private power and minimizes public accountability. Whether the billionaires’ alignment with Trump and Musk is merely pragmatic or sincerely ideological, they stand to gain from the new administration’s crash program of dismantling government and regulatory agencies. For Trump, allying with such concentrated economic power helps him consolidate political control, at the expense of democracy. This fusion of money and power is nothing new. I saw something similar take shape in my native Russia. But three decades later, the Russian oligarchs’ bargain has ended up with only one true beneficiary: Vladimir Putin.\n&gt;\n&gt;America’s billionaires should take note. When extreme wealth combines forces with extreme power, the former can profit enormously for a time. As in Russia, the benefits of the executive’s policies are likely to flow upward: Super-wealthy Americans will enjoy tax breaks and deregulation for their businesses, while the poor will face rising prices, shrinking services, and reduced opportunity. But America’s tech oligarchs may discover sooner rather than later that, by undermining democratic governance, they are empowering an authoritarian president who can pick them off one by one—just as Putin did with the oligarchs who helped cement his rule.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;An authoritarian oligarchy is not a pleasant place to live in. Ask my 88-year-old aunt, who was hit by a car in a provincial Russian town some years ago and can no longer leave her apartment because of the long-term injuries she sustained. After the case was investigated, she was pressured to withdraw her testimony because the driver was the son of a local official. That is how Putin’s “power vertical,” as Russian political parlance refers to his highly centralized, top-down authority, reaches into the lives of the little people. The oligarchy’s erosion of the rule of law trickles down, corroding public trust and ultimately leaving everyone—elites and ordinary citizens alike—at the mercy of arbitrary absolutism. The billionaire class now rallying behind Trump would do well to consider the implications of such a partnership.\n&gt;\n&gt;For now, America still has a functioning electoral system, democratic institutions that have endured for centuries rather than decades, and a diverse, vibrant civil society. It also holds a vision of itself, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, in which everyone has the right to pursue a fulfilling and self-determined life. But as Putin showed, constitutions can be amended or worked around; Trump is already musing about a third term. To follow Russia’s cynical path—whereby an all-powerful ruler feeds the masses false promises of greatness and keeps the oligarchs in line with favors and threats—would be to lose sight of that vision.\n\nIf the rule of law doesn't apply fairly to all, and instead is applied selectively to a few, then the corruption that this engenders will affect every aspect of society at every level. The public should be aware of these dangers, and push back against these changes to societal and government norms, but to be able to do that effectively they would first need to understand what is at stake here. There is still the ability for some agency by the American public, but this too is not guaranteed under the current regime.\n\nedit: added sentence.",

If you look at the big picture, crude oil is exported from the country of origin and usually pass through multiple destinations before reaching the final consumer. For example, one country exports oil to another, and then from the very same hub in the second country, a very similar product is exported to a third country. It makes no sense logistically, but this is how it works, and it's no surprise that this inflates the prices of the final product.\n\nMost oil goes through several refinements, not just the common fractioning of different fuels, but also frequent mixing with other products from various sources before being further refined into polymers and other materials. At the end of the day, when you buy a Christmas toy for your child that was manufactured in China, there’s a very high chance that the polymer used in the plastic was derived from Russian crude oil. By buying this toy, you are paying your fair share to Putin, whether you like it or not.\n\nSo no, there is absolutely no way to stop Russian products from entering the U.S. market in one form or another.",

Your example with Cuba is somewhat irrelevant because Cuba is such a small country that it can easily be isolated with barely any negative impact. Russia however, cannot be shut off so easily because it is a major producer of crude oil and fuels. Even if the U.S. completely halts imports, Russia could just lower its prices slightly and ramp up exports to other countries like China. The U.S. cannot simply shut down China for doing business with Russia. That will never happen since both countries need each other - China, a major producer, needs the U.S. big market, and vice versa. So practically U.S. is still subsidizing the Russian economy indirectly. Additionally, playing these games hurts other crude oil markets in the Middle East, which are controlled by the U.S. So, it’s not as simple as just cutting Russia off completely.

This could represent a shift in the president’s relationship with Putin which previously had been one of adoration. As recently as last month, Trump bashed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a social media post, calling him a “dictator” and threatening that if he doesn’t agree to a peace deal, “he is not going to have a Country left.”\n\nRead more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-very-angry-pissed-off-putin-ukraine-1235306583/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-very-angry-pissed-off-putin-ukraine-1235306583/)",
