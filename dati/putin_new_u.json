I read this week about Ukrainian units having a lot of success here by using drone dropped caltrops (an ancient anti cavalry defensive tool that is essentially spiked metal twisted up). The caltrops pierce the wheels of the motorbikes and ATVs that Russia has been increasingly using for assaults, rendering them useless. They claimed to have achieved a 66:1 casualty ratio between Russian and Ukrainian troops here, which sounds unbelievably high.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbvlbp7ik8gf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2b2449a8d0458ddc7c3460ec22768163da1de\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtmuzfqik8gf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f89fb594646477ffa189eeec533cbb3e26f732\n\n* Russians expanded the grey zone west of Chasiv Yar, now covering the whole city, though I don't consider a city lost until it is entirely red. Still, that seems like it will happen any week now. Ukraine has fought long and hard for this city, and deserves a lot of credit for how long they have held the Russians here, just a few miles away from Bakhmut.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbkqt19jk8gf1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93327c015e2fdaa4a13cb1bd10f8a6eb9063fcfc\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf53t5pjk8gf1.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8686ab7ee5a499ef1a47ba560528798edde251ab\n\n* More Russian advances between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and it seems at least one Russian assault group made it into the town of Pokrovsk itself before being driven out.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmkcc0bkk8gf1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929b8b2d8758a2bfad4d6ce82478a6fcae6aa663\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqjib2qkk8gf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d0cb0b35cece561a2f650949744061dfe78c1d\n\n* Russians advanced here in three different places, though none of them are particularly large advances. This is tough defensive territory because there are no significant towns between Huliapole and Velykomykhailivka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump said that he is shortening the previous 50 days he had given Putin to come to the table, though he didn't exactly specify the time period (I saw 12 days being mentioned so I put that in the title). Still, he has been more and more critical of Putin and has repeated that he is the one who is blocking peace. He also threatened India with secondary tariffs if they don't stop buying Russian oil, which is very significant since India has been one of the biggest funders of Russia's war through these continued purchases. Trump and Modi have been very close in the past, so I was surprised to see him go as hard on them as he is, but I'm glad someone is finally trying to hold India to account for how much money they have supplied Putin with. India, as they love to do, is whining and trying to act like this is unreasonable, but what is really unreasonable is continuing to buy oil from a country that is killing thousands and thousands of people in an illegal and unjustified war of aggression. India is now being forced to take a side, and I don't see them ultimately siding with China and Russia here.\n* Under strong international and domestic pressure, Ukraine's parliament signed a law repealing the attempted gutting of neutrality for anti-corruption organizations. I'm still rather confused as to why anyone attempted this in the first place or thought they would get away with it, this whole thing seems like a big self-own from Zelensky, but I understand that he is under a lot of pressure from many different sides, and probably just made a bad call. Either way, it's good that they were forced to quickly recognize the error of their ways and repeal the law.\n* Ukrainian hackers hit major Russian airline Aeroflot with a massive cyberattack that halted the airline's operations and leaked tons of important documents. Russian media is now saying it may take as many as 6 months for them to fully restore their operations. Anything that causes disruptions of economic activity in Russia is very useful.\n* The Russian economy continues to face significant headwinds, as the Russian Central Bank runs out of tools they can use to continue their economic shell game where they move different debts around in order to keep the Russian economy moving. Non-military companies are facing increasingly dire economic outlooks, and British and European sanctions and aggressive enforcement against the Russian shadow tanker fleet are limiting their options for how they can sell their oil above the EU-imposed price cap. I don't expect anything to collapse overnight, but as I've said before, I believe that by the end of this year or the first half of next year, their ability to continue funding the war at the current level will be severely degraded.\n* Several major European governments are preparing to request billions of dollars in loans from the EU to purchase military equipment for themselves and for Ukraine under the new Security Assistance Facility for Europe program. Ukraine currently has tens of billions of dollars worth of military production sitting idle due to a lack of funds. If their military industrial complex was fully funded, they would be in a vastly better position, and it does look like that may happen relatively soon.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,432 (+35)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,082 (+7)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,076 (+5)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+0)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+0)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 163 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,493 (+61)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,232 (+6)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,430 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1053 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 611 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of greater overall Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russians, though it's important to note that in the most crucial categories of tanks and IFVs, Ukraine is very slightly below Russia, and many of Ukraine's vehicle losses are coming from easily replaced IMVs.\n\nThank you for reading!",

        "body": "From the article: U.S. President Donald Trump said on July 28 that he aims to shorten the 50-day deadline he had set for a peace deal in Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressing disappointment with the Kremlin leader.\n\nThe U.S. president was referring to his July 14 warning that Washington would impose up to 100% in secondary tariffs on Russia unless Moscow agreed to a peace deal in Ukraine within the next 50 days.\n\n\"We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,\" Trump said alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the Turnberry golf club in Scotland.\n\n\"So we are going to have to look, and I am going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number because I think I already know the answer — what is going to happen.\"\n\nOn July 14, during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said he \"is disappointed in President Putin\" and warned he would impose \"severe tariffs\" if a ceasefire in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days.\n\nThe proposed tariffs would target Russian imports and impose secondary sanctions on nations purchasing Russian oil. Given the limited direct trade between the U.S. and Russia, these secondary measures are expected to have a significant effect.\n\nDespite Trump's warnings, Russia has continued drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities and maintains offensives on multiple areas of the front line, especially in Donetsk and Sumy oblasts.\n\nTrump's latest statement followed the third round of Ukraine-Russia talks on July 23, which, like the previous rounds, ended without a ceasefire agreement.\n\nIn the meantime, Russia continues to push for the same core demands it outlined at the start of its full-scale invasion in 2022: a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, large-scale demilitarization of the country, and legal \"guarantees\" for the Russian language, culture, and Moscow-linked religious groups in Ukraine.",

The state of New York has a definition of \"rape\" and \"physical abuse\" that meant his attack was defined as physical abuse for the jurors who found him guilty, but the judge clarified it was just as easily rape.  You can rape someone without using a penis.  (Part of the lawsuit was that Trump was too small to penetrate Ms. Carroll and resorted to using his fingers instead-- rape).  These were both extremely well-reported and well-documented.    There is no arguing it didn't happen.  In this case, you are arguing for a flat earth.",

As the battlefield intensifies and political pressure mounts, Zelensky opens up about Ukraine’s urgent defense needs and a potential high-stakes drone deal with the United States that could reshape the fight against Russia and the future of global warfare. Zelensky also reacts to former President Donald Trump's controversial approach to sanctioning Moscow, the 50 day deadline given to Putin, and shares surprising reflections on what he and Trump might actually have in common. With the future of U.S. support hanging in the balance, this wide-ranging interview offers a firsthand look at how Ukraine's leader views American politics, military aid and the stakes for global democracy.",

It can track and destroy slow flying drones very cost-effectively since it only has to shoot a relatively small burst to down a drone, thanks to its remarkable accuracy. Systems like this are some of the most important anti-drone weapons out there.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2i3yk1rxfdf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d916be47e4261b06145dcc6dfb79cbcb5e4f2fa2\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyrzdz96yfdf1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4caaa4668008cbb756479547545e20d1df4553f8\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10p4o0e8yfdf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d44129de715cccf8ca9f12302d84bed8d2b6f3aa\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngdm0b49yfdf1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=524f2d85b29ebbeeb85560e73ee634f84f8db4b2\n\n* No changes here.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l06k3j4byfdf1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77bd9b971fed6f19940127e4d555cbb81fcdae2b\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bokk4iobyfdf1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0adeae5c755d30755c2a3f777eaa3ef91c384153\n\n* Small advance made by the Russians in the salient north of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjx537ngyfdf1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b84210da4fcd3f3ca31be95f933bbcd988d65a4\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsxvow8hyfdf1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fdac371d4a43265bd89f4a90be873abefbd727\n\n* Russia advanced to close a gap in their lines south of Chasiv Yar.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnpkt6nlyfdf1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf58014673b117d69648fb5cf8f029640256e355\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hfird28myfdf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ec4de0e4a3fb63e164b9d3ee614e98fabd01c8\n\n* Extremely critical Russian advance here north of Myrnohrad.

This bill would hit Russia harder with sanctions than anything before, including tough secondary sanctions in the form of steep tariffs on any country that does a lot of business with Russia, particularly India and China. Potential sanctions on India are especially interesting since they are pretty close with Trump, though they are also one of the biggest external funders of Russia's war since they buy huge amounts of Russian oil. He additionally authorized the first new presidential draw down aid package for Ukraine since he's been president, allowing hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to be sent.\n* He also announced, alongside NATO head and all-around good guy Mark Rutte, that a deal is being worked out whereby European nations will buy large amounts of American war materiel to donate to Ukraine. While it's not as good as straight up aid, this will still result in a substantial amount of support for Ukraine. The first package is estimated to be worth $10 billion, which is more than any individual aid package we sent to Ukraine.\n* France and Italy, however, have both said they are opting out of this deal, as they greatly prefer to spend money on domestically produced systems. Both countries are still strong supporters of Ukraine, but they don't want to buy American arms when they could use the money to benefit their own economies, and, especially in the case of France, already produce domestic versions of most of the equipment required.\n* Germany announced that it is providing long range strike weapons to Ukraine. Whether or not these are the infamous Taurus missiles they've been waffling about sending for years now is unclear, though it seems like it might be. Long overdue if so.\n* Reporting also indicated this week that during Trump's call with Zelensky last week, he asked whether Ukraine was capable of hitting Moscow and St. Petersburg to force Russia to the negotiating table. While he later seemed to walk back this sentiment, it shows that Trump is interested in some way in hitting Putin where it hurts.\n* I've also seen an unconfirmed report that all restrictions on the use of ATACMS will be lifted, allowing Ukraine to strike anywhere in Russia within range, though I need to see more confirmation on this.\n* A high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence officer was assassinated by individuals working for Russia's FSB intelligence service in Kyiv. This was a rare success by the FSB within Ukraine. Ukraine's SBU service claimed to have killed the assassins in a gunfight several days later.\n* According to an analysis by the Economist, in the past year Russia has gained about .038 square kilometers of territory for each dead soldier. At the rate they are going, it would take 89 years for them to seize all of Ukraine. While this analysis obviously doesn't take into account the possibility of front collapses allowing Russia to move faster, it's still worth keeping in mind when you read that Russia is advancing.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,341 (+46)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,071 (+6)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,061 (+7)\n* Russian SPG losses: 957 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 339 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,347 (+55)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,217 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,419 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1016 (+12)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 597 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of fairly light vehicle losses on both sides, though it's always a bit concerning to see Ukrainian losses be higher than Russian losses. I've also noticed that the loss rate of Ukrainian SPG systems has gone up in the past few months. They have tons of these and are able to domestically produce large numbers of them, so they can make up these losses, but it definitely seems like Russia has been able to step up its ability to target them.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading.",

I think this specific part of the package is going to be very difficult to actually implement and it might not be in Ukraine's interest if it hits the American consumer in the pocket too hard and turns them against helping Ukraine. Finding the right rate that it makes it too expensive for China to continue buying Russian oil but not too expensive for American consumers to bear is going to be hard.  \nThe important thing is that weapons supplies will begin immediately. The secondary tariffs being slow to start makes sense to me politically and economically. Which is not to say that Trump won't flip flop.

Citizens will not stand up for civic rights. The Russian people suffer from a victim complex: they believe that nothing depends on them, and by them nothing can be changed.\n\n&gt;‘It’s always been so’, they say, signing off on their civic impotence. The economic dislocation of the nineties, the cheerless noughties, and now President Vladimir Putin’s iron rule – with its fake elections, corrupt bureaucracy, monopolization of mass media, political trials and ban on protest – have inculcated a feeling of total helplessness. People do not vote in elections: ‘They’ll choose for us anyway;’ they don’t attend public demonstrations: ‘They’ll be dispersed anyway;’ they don’t fight for their rights: ‘We’re alive, and thank god for that.’\n\n&gt;A 140-million-strong population exists in a somnambulistic state, on the verge of losing the last trace of their survival instinct. They hate the authorities, but have a pathological fear of change. They feel injustice, but cannot tolerate activists. They hate bureaucracy, but submit to total state control over all spheres of life. They are afraid of the police, but support the expansion of police control. **They know they are constantly being deceived, but believe the lies fed to them on television.**\n\n  \nShe hit the nail on the head about her fellow Russians when she noted:\n\n\n\n&gt;All that remains for those ashamed of the present and afraid of the future is pride in the past. **When there’s no reason to love your country, hate your neighbours. If you are unable to improve your life, ruin someone else’s.**\n\n\n\nThe Russians with their pathological complexes and sordid history consistently remind me of the observation that one must not help someone who refuses to be helped. \n\nWhat's left then is only vigorous and decisive defense against such malevolence and sense of butthurt.\n\nHow many more \"second chances\" do we in the civilized world are to keep handing out to the \"oppressed\" and \"misunderstood\" Russians so that they finally get their ѕhіt together?

Eventually, the only reasonable, rational even, answer is to just stay on the ground and let your abuser go about their business hoping they don't notice you. And when your abuser is literally the central government, there isn't a lot you can do about that short of outright revolt.\n\nThe problem is, the most abused people in Russia exist a long distance from the seats of central power in Moscow and St. Petersburg, entirely by design.

This term best describes the current state of Russian society.\n\n&gt;**Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.**\n\n&gt;It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:\n\n&gt;“The Аmеrісаnѕ let the price of oil fall. The Аmеrісаnѕ organised a revolution in Ukraine. Аmеrіса hаtеѕ Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and ІіbеrаІѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brоthеrѕ stole all the money. But Putin is good.”\n\n&gt;There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.\n\n&gt;Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.\n\n&gt;In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.\n\n&gt;The absolute lack of understanding of the value of life is just as infantile.\n\n&gt;It is not acceptable for adults to inflate a frog with a straw, to decapitate a puppy, to pound residential neighbourhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction, or to shoot down passenger jets with surface-to-air missiles while thinking:\n\n&gt;“What difference does it make whether it was a passenger jet or not? The birdie is down, hooray! We did warn them not to fly in our skies!”\n\n&gt;The failure to grasp the value of life, including one’s own, is perhaps the main characteristics of an infantile person. In addition to the lack of any logical thinking.\n\n&gt;That is a world where causal links are broken, where actions and consequences are not related in any manner, and where throwing eggs from the window and a cuff on the ear are two totally unrelated developments — just like the occupation of a part of a neighbouring country, sanctions, and the collapse of oil prices.\n\n  \nBabchenko's examples of inflating a frog with a straw, decapitating a puppy, pounding residential neighborhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction and shooting down passenger jets with SAMs fit like a glove when recalling what the Russians are openly doing in real-time to the Ukrainians.",

For some reason posts with a link to the article are routinely deleted even though the domain is not a Russian one.\n\nAnother good article on how crucial brutality is to the Russians and their self-regard comes from [an interview with various counterintelligence officers from the Baltic states](https://vsquare.org/baltic-counterintelligence-officers-russia-cruelty-war-history/) who started their careers in the KGB when the Russians were occupying their countries.\n\nLastly, there's a translated interview with Dmitry Titkov, a former associate of Navalny's, available on various Reddit posts. It was done with a Polish newspaper in February 2022, and he goes on to identify that a key element in Russian identity is the imperialistic self-entitlement to the destiny of **non**\\-Russians.\n\nHere's a snippet\n\n&gt;*When the war broke out, in Stockholm, where I am seeking asylum, Navalny's supporters decided to support Ukraine and march in front of the Russian embassy. There was a discussion whether to go there with a Russian flag. This proves that even if someone is an opponent of Putin, they still don't fully realise that it's not just about Putin. Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians, Chechens and Georgians understand me very well. In Russia, all the people are either asleep and only see what is in front of their noses and believe Putin's propaganda, or they are against Putin - but still remain within the imperial framework. When the question arises whether to trust Russians or not - I say: trust only those who no longer associate themselves with Russia, who want to learn other languages, who understand that Russia must fall apart, that it must cease to exist as an empire.*\n\n&gt;*I was born and raised in the Arkhangelsk region and I believe that there could be an Arkhangelsk Republic without any Moscow, culturally and economically integrated with Scandinavia. The Caucasus could also exist separately - and so on.*\n\n&gt;*Those who keep saying 'Russia will be happy', 'Russia will be free' - have not understood anything. Russia should no longer exist.*\n\nGoogle \"Titkov Russians have no sympathy\" to find the whole article. It's quite enlightening and refreshing since Titkov is one of the very few Russians out there who identifies that his compatriots and their foundational imperialism have been the problems, and not whatever excuse is used to blame non-Russians for whatever ails Russians. He didn't even spare himself since his interview includes how that ingrained Russian imperialism blinded him initially to how his non-Russian peers felt about his ethnic background.",

I rode the train with two girls who escaped from Kharkiv before the Russian bombings. They are closer to me than any of the Russians, and when I listened to them, I was ready to go and kill Russian soldiers myself.

They must be protected by their different identities, traditions and religions and by their historical grievances against Muscovy\n\nIt's probably because they are not at the top of the caste system that has defined Russian society.\n\nOn the upper levels of the caste system are ethnic Russians with the richest and suitably сuсkеd and corrupted ones being at the very top. Furthermore, there's a socially-acceptable distinction in which an ethnic Russian from Moscow or St. Petersburg has more prestige than an ethnic Russian from elsewhere to say nothing about any **non**\\-Russian regardless of birthplace. Russian itself lexicalizes this distinction by using the terms *Русские* (Russkiye) to mean ethnic Russians and *Россияне* (Rossiyane) to refer to all citizens of Russia. In contrast, we in English use \"Russian(s)\" for both senses.\n\nBeing an ethnic minority in Russia elicits varying amounts of condescension, sometimes worsened or abetted by your hometown. On a somewhat related note, Volga Tatars are rather like a notably cynical variant of the \"model minority\" in Russia because of how their distinctiveness and relative demographic and socioeconomic success are used to play up ethnic Russians' \"tolerance\" all while still being tools of Russian imperialism. For example, after the Russians had goose-stepped their way into Crimea in 2014, [delegations of Volga Tatars went to Crimea to legitimize the Russians' re-annexation by spouting buІІѕhіt to the Crimean Tatars](https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-is-trying-to-weaken-crimean-tatar-resistance-with-the-help-of-tatarstan/) of how things wouldn't be *that* bad in Crimea under renewed Russian occupation.\n\nNote that Crimean Tatars and Volga Tatars are clearly related as Turkic people but their languages differ from each other roughly as much as Dutch does from Norwegian.",

Hopefully those features will be fixed next week.\n\nSumy last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cu0mq5xs52cf1.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a1e96ad8c60797031a132f92abd94e7225a953\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wm7noowv52cf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29c7d0114631f086b8793c5aa0fbbf25193ad2ed\n\n* Russia has pushed further in this sector both in the center and the west.\n\nKupiansk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikplfjq772cf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e21d8f3e0b98361b98b22680c7e6b7be17721b1\n\nKupiansk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sto4vhb872cf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc6a71b368c852b230013c78e82db36e337b66b\n\n* No changes here.\n\nLyman last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4hbdvaa72cf1.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b60272661c327f8211d6d896d2fa9ceec33d5d2\n\nLyman this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9l929xa72cf1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee300d84bc7c35680aa65959841b0d5379c40101\n\n* No changes here either.\n\nChasiv Yar last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4z5mv8kd72cf1.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff34a7864f1085aa19836c066ef95f803132a7b3\n\nChasiv Yar this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq4r8b2e72cf1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7044626d888fc28a6cb6d0965f31c6638e0851d3\n\n* Russia advanced within the city for the first time in a while.

He said he was also trying to arrange the purchase of another Patriot battery by Ukraine. While the actions and words from his administration about Ukraine have been incredibly schizophrenic, I do think this represents a real change for Trump as he is finally realizing there is no negotiating with Putin about the war, and that he and Putin don't have a real relationship. While I wish that this whole thing would have been less pathetically predictable and transparently about Trump's ego rather than what is right, I'm still glad that the US finally seems to be moving in the right direction.\n* On that note, the sanctions bill against Russia now has very significant momentum in Congress, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune saying it could even be passed this month. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also expressed support for the bill this week, which I don't think he had done before. When this bill gets passed (not if), it will turn Russia's already bad economic situation into a potentially catastrophic one. \n* Germany has released more details on its massive rearmament plan. They want to buy 1,000 tanks, thousands more APCs and IFVs, and large quantities of other crucial military equipment. By comparison, Germany currently has just under 300 tanks in its military, so this would triple that number. The scale of this plan is quite significant and they are clearly taking this seriously after a long time of treating their military with contempt. Merz also said he wants to finance the purchasing of more Patriot systems for Ukraine. Germany has production facilities for Patriot missiles which means it's one of the only countries outside the US that can natively sustain a Patriot capability. \n* Bloomberg reported that Russia is resorting to confiscating property from businesses in order to sustain its war effort since their oil revenues are declining so much. They have supposedly stolen almost $50 billion dollars from their own people this way. \n* Another Bloomberg report says that the EU is considering budgeting over $120 billion dollars in aid for Ukraine over the next 7 years. They are also looking at different ways they can fill the $19 billion budget gap that Ukraine is projected to have next year. \n* Russia keeps hitting Ukraine very hard with larger and larger drone and missile strikes, last night's attack was the biggest yet. Unfortunately each week sees larger attacks. Extensive damage was done in Kyiv and also in western Ukraine. \n* Ukraine is working on ways to counter this threat, however, especially with cheaply manufactured interceptor drones which can do the work of air defense missiles with a much smaller footprint and for far less money. They are rapidly scaling up production of these drones, which could be a real game changer for air defense against other drones. \n* The Economist published new estimates on casualties and deaths for Russia and Ukraine during the war. They say that since May 1 alone, 31,000 Russians have been killed. In total, they estimate between 900,000 and 1.3 million Russian casualties (killed + wounded), and 190,000 to 350,000 killed. For Ukraine, they estimate 73,000 to 140,000 total deaths in the war. These are shocking numbers. \n* Russia is allegedly planning on importing tens of thousands more North Korean troops to man their border with Ukraine, freeing up Russian troops to be sent into the country and fight on the front line. \n* Both sides have begun widespread use of drones with autonomous terminal guidance systems that allow them to attack targets on their own, limiting the ability of electronic warfare efforts to hinder them. I personally think autonomously targeted drones are an enormous threat to the human race, but I understand that in this war, you can't really take the moral high ground at the cost of your own soldier's lives. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,295 (+45)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,065 (+16)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,054 (+9)\n* Russian SPG losses: 956 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 338 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+2)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,292 (+18)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,210 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,409 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1004 (+4)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 590 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nNot sure if Oryx simply hasn't done much updating this week or something, but these are some of the lowest vehicle loss numbers, if not the absolute lowest, I've seen in almost two years of these updates, which is quite strange considering that there is heavy combat happening all over the front. \n\nThank you for reading!",

He only respects power, and he has power, thus, he feels entitled to the same respect he's been giving Putin. The problem though, Putin comes from the soviet era, where showing any weakness, ever, means you won't be respected, and could lose that power. Trump, a business man, thinks leverage is in the negotiation, where he's used to intimidating people with his shallow world salad and financial bravado. Putin, by nature, cannot agree to or even appear to even consider negotiating with Trump, or he will lose all respect, and become a target. They're both con men, but Putin has actually given out orders to have people killed in order to show everyone else that he isn't to be crossed, while Trump has just continuously tried to cozy up to Putin in the hopes that Putin will show him \"American\" respect. He's only now figuring out that he will never get that kind of respect, and his feelings are hurt. That's it. He doesn't give a fuck about a single Ukranian and he never will, and pretty much fucking everybody knows that.",

There is no doubt in my mind that their propaganda machine and financial campaigns, buying up both right wing and left wing influencers and politicians, has helped bring Trump and many other despots into power across the globe.\n\n\nI truly wish I had the answer. I've seen people in my life I used to consider family, people I thought were intelligent and not easily influenced, shilling for blatant Putin operatives here in the US. \n\n\nPeople that are kind, compassionate, and generous, who are now saying voting for, say, Bernie Sanders is no different from voting for Donald Trump.  According to them, \"they're all the same\".\n\n\nThere are videos in African countries where the Wagner group was assigned, of many hundreds of people waving the russian flag. (Of course every single one one of these types of videos should be questioned, no one should take them at face value. They probably paid those people.)\n\n\nIt's SO easy for them to exploit the narrative of \"well USA/UK/Europe/NATO has exploited us, so anyone who opposes them is good\" sentiment. Not just in Africa or Asia or Latin America, but across western democratic societies.\n\n\nPeople *desperately* want something that isn't \"what we have right now\", so it's pretty easy.\n\n\nWhat baffles me is that Russia is so, SO very good at influencing the global narrative, so good at turning people against each other (not just bots on social media, but paying and influencing actual real-life people high up in government and media), but are such absolute shit at waging a ground war.\n\n\nI guess an influence war is a lot cheaper &amp; more effective in the long run.\n\n\nIt's a lot easier to convince people to go on a cyber war campaign than a \"getting your limbs blown off\" war. ",

The parents weren't phased. They thought he had really good aim for his age.\n\n\n\nThis observation reminds me of what another Russian, Аrkаdiу Ваbсhеnkо, described as his people's ingrained **infantilism**.\n\n\n\n&gt;If you asked me to characterise the “Russian World” (Russky mir) in one word, I would not hesitate to call it infantilism. This term best describes the current state of Russian society.\n\n&gt;**Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.**\n\n&gt;It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:\n\n&gt;“The Аmеrісаnѕ let the price of oil fall. The Аmеrісаnѕ organised a revolution in Ukraine. Аmеrіса hаtеѕ Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and ІіbеrаІѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brоthеrѕ stole all the money. But Putin is good.”\n\n&gt;There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.\n\n&gt;Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.\n\n&gt;In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.\n\n&gt;The absolute lack of understanding of the value of life is just as infantile.\n\n&gt;It is not acceptable for adults to inflate a frog with a straw, to decapitate a puppy, to pound residential neighbourhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction, or to shoot down passenger jets with surface-to-air missiles while thinking:\n\n&gt;“What difference does it make whether it was a passenger jet or not? The birdie is down, hooray! We did warn them not to fly in our skies!”\n\n&gt;The failure to grasp the value of life, including one’s own, is perhaps the main characteristics of an infantile person. In addition to the lack of any logical thinking.\n\n&gt;That is a world where causal links are broken, where actions and consequences are not related in any manner, and where throwing eggs from the window and a cuff on the ear are two totally unrelated developments — just like the occupation of a part of a neighbouring country, sanctions, and the collapse of oil prices.\n\nThe Russians are practically irredeemable until they prove otherwise. That is something that has happened in *vanishingly few instances* out of a pool of the more than 140 million direct descendants of the Golden Horde's staunchest ~~collaborators~~ bootlickers.\n\nIt's a sucker's game to give the benefit of the doubt to the Russians when they have taken it as a national characteristic to upend, invalidate, or even destroy, the norms of non-Russians and the rest of the civilized world.",

In this case, the Russians have come to define themselves as a nation that *needs* autocracy/absolute monarchy, or even totalitarianism, for its own good.\n\nIn contrast, democracy or even genuinely representative multi-party government is dangerously chaotic and \"un-Russian\". This is a big reason how Russian dissidents repeatedly go *nowhere* because so many of their ethnic kin regularly chicken out or lose their ѕhіt once they start to realize that they need to take responsibility for themselves and their choices, and learn to trust each other, never mind foreigners, to make any societal progress.\n\nInstead, their unholy hybrid society of a caste system with an extractive economy is functionally the same as when generation after generation of their ancestors chose to be the most loyal *bitсhеѕ* of the Khan of the Golden Horde.",

        "body": "From the article: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara is working to organize a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with U.S. President Donald Trump potentially joining the talks, Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking after his meeting with Trump, Erdogan said on June 26 that the U.S. president expressed interest in participating if the meeting were to take place in Turkey.\n\n\"He said,'If Russian President Vladimir Putin comes to Istanbul or Ankara for a solution, then I will also come,'\" Erdogan told reporters. \"We will hold the necessary contacts and, God willing, realize this meeting as soon as possible.\"\n\nZelensky and Trump met during the NATO summit on June 25, where the two leaders discussed battlefield developments, Kyiv's need for additional air defense systems, and the potential for co-production of drones.\n\nZelensky has previously voiced openness to a trilateral meeting. On May 27, he told public broadcaster Suspilne that he was ready to sit down with both Trump and Putin.\n\nPutin has claimed he is also willing to meet, but did not attend previous talks proposed in Istanbul, opting instead to send lower-level delegates to peace discussions held on May 16.\n\nThe Kremlin has long sought to portray Zelensky as \"illegitimate\", with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in February claiming that any talks must consider \"legal aspects\" of his mandate.\n\nTurkey previously hosted direct peace talks in March 2022 and has remained one of the few countries with open lines to both Kyiv and Moscow. The latest round of direct talks on June 2 was held in Istanbul.",

        "body": "Jeez, I wonder who may be helping him with this \"possibilitym\" 🤔 oh right... \n\nA few examples of why trump is a Russian asset. Here we have the peace talk plan he had propsed with Russia and Ukraine to start off with - \n\n&gt;What Russia gets under Trump's proposal\n\n&gt;\"De jure\" U.S. recognition of Russian control in Crimea.\n\n&gt;\"De-facto recognition\" of the Russia's occupation of nearly all of Luhansk oblast and the occupied portions of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n\n&gt;A promise that Ukraine will not become a member of NATO. The text notes that Ukraine could become part of the European Union.\n\n&gt;The lifting of sanctions imposed since 2014.\n\n&gt;Enhanced economic cooperation with the U.S., particularly in the energy and industrial sectors.\n\nAnd then see how he also treated Zelensky at the white house and stopped giving them weapons and aide, even after that order was lifted too! And then we have [the 5 times he's met with Putin and no one was allowed to know what was being discussed. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings.html) On top of that we also have [\"Senate panel finds Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election\" ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election) which both a republican led panel and the Judiciary and Homeland Security looked into themselves. Seems to me you'd owe a lot to a country/man that helps win you a presidency.\n\nNot to mention [from the project 2025 tracker policies on cybersecurity here](https://www.project2025.observer/?sort=status-desc&amp;subjects=JOxu3HkX8YLObmxj7xUz9) this particular policy -\n\n&gt;End Cybercom's participation in federal efforts to \"fortify\" U.S. elections.\n\n&gt;*Note: Secretary Hegseth ordered Cyber Command \"to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions*\n\n&gt;Remove Cybercom from the oversight of the National Security Agency. (Policy #2)\n\n&gt;This refers to a policy shift that removes U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) from federal efforts to protect elections from cyber threats. CYBERCOM has historically played a role in countering foreign interference, particularly from adversaries like Russia and China. The decision to end its participation could make U.S. elections more vulnerable to cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.\n\n&gt;The move is part of a broader agenda outlined in Project 2025, a policy framework developed by the Heritage Foundation. It argues that CYBERCOM’s involvement in election security is \"partisan\" and should be discontinued.\nCritics warn that this could empower foreign actors to manipulate U.S. elections and weaken national security. \n\n&gt;Additionally, Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly ordered CYBERCOM to halt all planning against Russia, including offensive cyber operations. This directive could significantly alter U.S. cyber defense strategies and limit responses to potential threats\n\nAnd finally Trump's top negotiator and advisor Steve witkoff doing this interview in mid april-[\"Trump's top negotiator says they are excited for commercial business opportunities with Putin soon.\" ](https://archive.is/20250416010920/https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-trump-negotiator-steve-witkoff-excited-about-commercial-opportunities-with-putin/) which is also why trump is only mad about the war currently, you can't conduct business in the open if it's ongoing and people hate Russia. How can people not see how this all equates to him most definitely being pretty damn intentional now?\n\n&gt;Starting in 2003, the Trump Organization worked with Felix Sater, who had a 1998 racketeering conviction for a $40 million stock fraud scheme orchestrated by the Russian mafia, and who had then become an informant against the mafia.[402][403] Trump's attorney has said that Sater worked with Trump scouting real estate opportunities, but was never formally employed.[404]\n\nHe also went to Russia in 1987 and wanted to build trump towers there and had his lawyers working on it, and tried hard to be accepted by the oligarchs. You can read about the trip to Moscow and what followed [in this article. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/19/trump-first-moscow-trip-215842/) And now we have this as of June 5th-\n\n&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace, even as Germany’s new chancellor appealed to him as the “key person in the world” who could halt the bloodshed by pressuring Vladimir Putin.\n\n&gt;In an Oval Office meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the U.S. president likened the war in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in February 2022 — to a fight between two children who hate each other. Trump said that with children, “sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” adding that he relayed the analogy to Putin in a call this week.\n\n&gt;“I said, ‘President, maybe you’re going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot,’ because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart, before they’re able to be pulled apart,” Trump said. “You see in hockey, you see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds, let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”\n\n[the 2016 election was proven to be rigged ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election) by the Senate panel and the CIA. And by the way this Senate panel that confirmed the evidence was Republican based.\n\n&gt;The nearly 1,000-page report, the fifth and final one from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee on the Russia investigation, details how Russia launched an aggressive effort to interfere in the election on Trump’s behalf. It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and says other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin’s aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers.\n\nRemember his [accusation in a mirror technique ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusation_in_a_mirror#:~:text=The%20strategy%20was%20used%20by,d'Expansion%20et%20de%20Recrutement.) with the whole, \"Hillary and the emails?\" Yeah that's because he was doing that the whole time. \n\n\n *BUT,* instead of focusing on repercussions, they decided to do this instead -\n\n&gt;While Mueller’s was a criminal probe, the Senate investigation was a counterintelligence effort with the aim of ensuring that such interference wouldn’t happen again. The report issued several recommendations on that front, including that the FBI should do more to protect presidential campaigns from foreign interference.\n\n&gt;*updated to add this message on behalf of the USA to russia-[\"US Wishes ‘Happy Russia Day’ as Kremlin’s War Casualty Toll in Ukraine Surpasses 1 Million\" ](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/54394)\n\nJune 16th-[\"Ukraine confirms US is now protecting Putin’s oil assets\" ](https://kyivinsider.com/ukraine-confirms-us-is-now-protecting-putins-oil-assets/)",

        "body": "The bullcrap is really flying from Trump.  Only Trump had the bombastic statements during the US election campaign that he could resolve everything in 24 hrs.  Everyone else stated he was living in a fantasy land.\n\nI think everything Trump has done, and has not done, has been part of a plan to further Russian interests.  What is proving more difficult for that plan is the resistance of everyone else to allowing it to occur.\n\nBut his statement about \"possible\" Putin will invade more than Ukraine?  That to me is just forecasting at the behest of Trump's boss Putin.  The only good thing about this is that Russia's desire to gobble up more territory in it's imperialistic ambitions is not matched by its capability.  And every day NATO, Ukraine and Pan Pacific allies are making that Russian imperialism less likely to happen.\n\nWe see the EU &amp; Canada pumping big money now into military production including production in Ukraine.  And results are already forthcoming from it but later this summer and fall I anticipate we will see more of the benefits forthcoming.\n\nRussia's reply is to hope that terrorizing civilians via missile strikes will cow Ukraine.  It won't.  Every civilian death is a tragedy but every time Russia strikes a civilian target instead of a Ukraine military target it allows Ukraine to inch that much further ahead in its own goals. \n\nRussia could settle the Ukraine matter anytime:  all it has to do is leave.  But it knows the terror it has wrought and what is yet to be exposed will have consequences to Russia, including internally in Russia.  So Putin will continue the war until Ukraine either forcibly expels him from Ukraine, or he dies.",

It is only right we use seized Russian assets to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences.

Russia’s economy is collapsing but for some reason Russia is the only country that Trump wouldn’t tariff. We could topple Putin if the US made stricter sanctions. But the US won’t be bothered even selling weapons to Ukraine. Despite claiming that we (the US) need Greenland to fight Russia. Maybe what Musk tweeted about the guy vetting Whitehouse staff not being vetted himself and a Russian asset is true.",

    "selftext": "From the Danish MOD (Machine translated)\n\nNote: 500 million DKK = *€*67 Million\n\n&gt;Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen and the Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov have signed an agreement to support Ukrainian defence companies' establishment of production in Denmark. The government has reserved DKK 500 million for efforts to strengthen the establishment of Ukrainian companies in Denmark.\n\n&gt;“Denmark is leading the way by giving Ukrainian defence companies the opportunity to start production in Denmark. The agreement will form the basis for close cooperation between Danish and Ukrainian defence companies. At the same time, it will give the Danish defence easier access to some of the latest technologies and experiences from Ukraine. In this way, the integration of our defence industries will be of great benefit to the security and combat power of both countries,” says Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen.\n\n&gt;“The agreement marks a next important step in the new ‘Build-with-Ukraine initiative’, which I announced at the last meeting in the Ramstein format. I am pleased that Ukraine is launching this next phase with Denmark, which is one of our closest partners and which has contributed billions to support Ukraine's security, as well as created growth in our defence industry through the Danish Model. The agreement forms the foundation for Danish-Ukrainian cooperation in the next decades,” says Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov.\n\n&gt;The Danish and Ukrainian defence ministers signed the agreement in connection with the NATO summit in The Hague.\n\n&gt;“The horrors of Putin know no bounds. Denmark has been standing shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainians since the beginning of the war. And now we are once again showing that the Danish support continues unabated. We live in a troubled time where it is absolutely vital that we have a strong defence industry. With the agreement, we are getting a big step closer to being able to fulfil the great potential of the Danish defence industry. For on a sad background, the Ukrainian defence industry has gained many valuable experiences that our own defense industry can now even more easily benefit from when we welcome the Ukrainians on Danish soil. This is a major contribution to Ukraine’s freedom struggle as well as the Danish and European armament,” says Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs Morten Bødskov.\n\n&gt;In the current security policy situation, there is a need to ensure the construction of new facilities and supply chains in Europe in order to strengthen Denmark's and Europe's overall combat power. By the establishment of Ukrainian companies in Denmark, the Ministry of Defence in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry, Business and Foreign Affairs will ensure a higher degree of integration of Ukraine into the European defence industry.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, the most important experience collection and technology development in the defence industry is taking place in these years on the basis of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\n&gt;“It is on a sad background that the Ukrainians with a tremendous speed and skillful innovation force have managed to build and scale their defense production. Denmark has since Russia's invasion in 2022 been behind Ukraine and provided significant military, civilian and financial support for Ukraine. Denmark continues, and with Ukrainian defence companies in Denmark, we are intensifying cooperation for the benefit of security in both Ukraine and the rest of Europe,” says Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen.\n\n&gt;",

So, troops were deployed in National Assembly, but protestors blocked them and rank-and-file soldiers refused illegal orders. \n\nNational assembly overturned martial law and impeached that maniac.

Far-right rioters stormed a courthouse and assaulted college campuses. It is rumored that those far-right even smuggled Russian weapons and foreign mercenaries to maximize chaos and kill elected officials. Military was under de facto paralysis as the top generals and defense minister for joining December 3rd insurrection.

Kazakhstan and the United Kingdom have signed a two-year military cooperation plan that includes Kazakhstan's officers' training at British academies, joint peacekeeping programs, exchange of experience in defense reform, and language training.”\n\nThe most recent Kazak president actually reformed the government too, redistributing a lot of powers back to each region within Kazakhstan, again so they can properly pull away from Russia.\n\n“On 17 September 2022, Tokayev signed a decree that limits presidential tenure to one term of seven years. He furthermore announced the preparation of a new reform package to \"decentralize\" and \"distribute\" power between government institutions. The reform package also seeks to modify the electoral system and increase the decision-making authorities of Kazakhstan's regions. The powers of the parliament were expanded at the expense of those of the president, relatives of whom are now also barred from holding government positions, while the Constitutional Court was restored and the death penalty abolished.”\n\nAnd also this:\n\n“Based on these principles, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kazakhstan has increasingly pursued an independent foreign policy, defined by its own foreign policy objectives and ambitions[121][122] through which the country attempts to balance its relations with \"all the major powers and an equally principled aversion towards excessive dependence in any field upon any one of them, while also opening the country up economically to all who are willing to invest there.\"[123]”\n\nSeems Russia is losing all its friends fast, Syria, Kazakhstan, now even Iran is about to be dismantled entirely LOL. I guess that’s what happens when you are still raping and pillaging your next door neighbour in 2025 on some psychotic imperial conquest like it’s the 1800’s.

    "selftext": "On June 17, Russian media reported that North Korea will dispatch 1,000 military engineers and 5,000 construction personnel to aid in the reconstruction of Russia’s Kursk region. According to the reports, Sergey Shoigu, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, disclosed this to reporters after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his visit to Pyongyang. Previously, North Korea had deployed 11,000 combat troops in October of last year and 4,000 more between January and February of this year to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. Including the new group of engineers and laborers, North Korea will have sent a total of 21,000 personnel to support Russia—deepening what analysts are calling a growing “honeymoon” phase in the North Korea–Russia alliance.\n\nShoigu stated that the engineering units would be involved in mine-clearing and reconstruction work in the Kursk region—a southern Russian territory that was temporarily captured by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in August 2023 but has since been largely reclaimed by Russian forces. He described the deployment as “a fraternal gesture from the people of North Korea and Chairman Kim Jong-un,” and noted that the work would begin soon.\n\nThe South Korean government is closely watching the situation, noting the potential for North Korea to gain additional economic benefits and military technology transfers through this reconstruction effort. A South Korean military official commented, “North Korea has already gained significant economic benefits from sending combat troops, and those benefits will likely increase through participation in post-war reconstruction,” adding that military tech transfers are also expected to accelerate.\n\n** Kim Jong-un Joins Reconstruction Projects—Further Tech Transfers Likely**\n\nSergey Shoigu has visited Pyongyang twice this month alone—on the 4th and again on the 17th. Russian media report that he was acting on a special directive from President Vladimir Putin. According to TASS and other outlets, Shoigu discussed the deployment of engineering personnel and ways to commemorate North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine during his recent meeting with Kim Jong-un.\n\nBecause this latest deployment involves engineers rather than combat troops, it is expected to generate steady and substantial economic gains for North Korea. Shin Beom-chul, former Vice Minister of South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense, stated, “Russia appears to have fulfilled its military needs from North Korea, and is now seeking help in reconstruction. Compensation for these efforts will likely go to North Korea.” He added that the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow is shifting from purely military cooperation to economic collaboration. “North Korea’s support for Russia allows it to receive not only military technology but also economic aid—thus helping it circumvent the impact of international sanctions,” he explained. “This may weaken the bargaining power of the U.S. and South Korea in future negotiations on North Korea’s nuclear program.”\n\nAnalysts also suggest that North Korea, having gained wealth through its alliance with Russia, is unlikely to pursue better relations with the United States. One South Korean defense official noted, “Recently, Kim Jong-un rejected a personal letter from former U.S. President Donald Trump—likely to signal North Korea’s strategic bet on Russia and show the world that it no longer feels the need to rely on improving relations with the U.S.”\n\nNorth Korea has already gained considerable financial rewards from its troop deployments to the Ukraine war. According to Im Soo-ho, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy, North Korea earned up to 1.8 trillion KRW (approx. $1.3 billion USD) annually from its first deployment, through salaries and enlistment bonuses. If North Korea participates in post-war reconstruction, its economic gains could exceed those from combat deployment alone.\n\nMilitary tech transfers from Russia to North Korea are also expected to speed up. Within the past year, North Korea has constructed two 5,000-ton class destroyers—Choe Hyon-ho and Kang Gun-ho—believed to be “North Korean Aegis destroyers” based on Russian radar and design technology. During a launch ceremony last month, the Kang Gun-ho reportedly capsized in front of Kim Jong-un, and repairs may now require Russian assistance.\n\nThe United Nations Multinational Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT) recently reported that Russia has provided various weapons and military technologies to North Korea in exchange for its troop support in Ukraine, constituting violations of UN Security Council resolutions. According to the MSMT, Russia transferred the Pantsir air defense system—designed to intercept drones—to North Korea in November 2024. \n\nRussia is also said to have handed over electronic warfare equipment and GPS-jamming technology, which North Korea has used to disrupt communications in South Korea, affecting cell towers, aircraft, and ships. Concerns are growing that these new capabilities may escalate North Korea’s electronic warfare provocations.\n\nRussia has reportedly transferred data and guidance technology related to ballistic missiles as well. North Korea has long struggled with reentry technology for its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), but this deficiency may now be addressed through Russian assistance. Last month, North Korea revealed a live-fire test of a new medium-range air-to-air missile, believed to incorporate Russian technology.",

Such a maneuver would not only betray our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty—it would corrode U.S. credibility and embolden authoritarian regimes worldwide. The stakes could not be higher.\n\nUkraine has demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression. Our NATO allies have stood resolute alongside them, affirming the principle that free nations have the right to chart their own destinies without coercion. Any attempt to force Ukraine into a deal on Putin's terms would strike at the heart of democracy, international law, and the collective security architecture the United States helped build and lead.\n\nThat is why I urge you to take immediate and decisive action to prevent any unilateral moves—by Trump or anyone else—that might compromise our alliances, appease authoritarianism, or undercut global security. Specifically, I ask you to:\n\n1. **Publicly reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO and to Ukraine’s sovereignty.** It is essential we send a clear, bipartisan message that America keeps its word—and stands with those who defend freedom.\n2. **Support legislation that strengthens congressional oversight of foreign policy,** preventing any administration from bypassing allies or making backroom deals that endanger global stability.\n3. **Advocate for sustained and expanded military and economic aid to Ukraine,** including lifting any remaining restrictions on the delivery of long-range weapons systems. Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength—not while one hand is tied behind its back.\n4. **Impose new, robust sanctions on Russia,** targeting sectors that continue to bankroll its war machine and signaling that aggression will be met with escalating consequences, not diplomatic reward.\n5. **Champion legislation that protects Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers,** particularly in light of Trump’s radical anti-immigration agenda. No one fleeing Putin’s war should be subjected to deportation or bureaucratic purgatory in the United States.\n\nThe American people overwhelmingly support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. We cannot allow political expediency or authoritarian nostalgia to erode that support. History is watching—and the cost of appeasement is always paid in blood.\n\nThank you for your leadership and commitment to democratic values. I look forward to your response and to seeing bold, principled action on this issue.\n\n**Sincerely,**\n\n\\[Your Name\\]",

That made Ukraine very sad and angry.\n\nUkraine had a secret team of spies (kind of like superheroes who wear normal clothes and do super sneaky things). At first, their team was broken. So their friends from another country, America, helped them get strong again.\n\nNow the Ukraine spies are really good at stopping the bad guys. They do things like:\n\n1. Break the bully’s airplanes so they can’t hurt people.\n\n2. Find the mean generals (the big bosses of the bully army) and stop them.\n\n3. Send little flying robots to mess up the bully’s stuff.\n\n4. Help good people in other countries too.\n\n\nTheir team has an owl for a symbol — because owls are smart, quiet, and can see in the dark! 🦉\n\nThe bully (Russia) is very mad about this, but Ukraine is not scared anymore. They are fighting back in smart ways.\n\nBut sometimes the bully gets even meaner and throws bombs at homes. One of the bombs made a building fall down and sadly a young couple who loved each other got hurt. \n\nSo the Ukraine spies are trying to stop the bully so no more people get hurt.",

    "score": 125,
    "created_utc": "2025-06-07T10:20:05",
    "selftext": "It seems that no one has any doubt that Trump is an idiot anymore.  \nOne can endlessly discuss his daily displays of idiocy, his absurd behavior, his economic illiteracy, his inability to finish a thought, his meager vocabulary, his narcissism, his mental disorders, poor memory and cognitive decline as signs of dementia, his shuffling back and forth for which he received the nickname TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out).  \nBut now everyone is wondering: how did this idiot become the president of the United States??  \nThe exhaustive answer to this question was given 500 years ago by Niccolò Machiavelli.   \nMachiavelli explained that power is a spectacle. Here, the winner is not the one who knows best, but the one who plays best. Real rulers are masters of the image. Their strength lies not so much in the truth as in its presentation. And the more loud and confident the image they create, the higher their chances of winning and staying on the throne.  \nAccording to Machiavelli, society is to blame for the fact that idiots come to power. But he did not accuse society of stupidity, he simply showed how perception works.\nAnd perception is not often interested in the truth. It is interested in form, effect, confidence. And therefore intelligence becomes an obstacle to leadership, because intelligence makes a person less suitable for power.\nModern psychology and sociology confirm what Machiavelli understood back in the Renaissance. When the IQ exceeds 120, the influence of intelligence begins to play against effective leadership. The reason is that overly intelligent people begin to think too complexly for the perception of the majority. Their speeches become saturated with nuances. They do not give quick and unambiguous answers, constantly make warnings, avoid categoricality, resort to deep analysis. This makes them less understandable, less marketable and less charismatic.  \nAnd people, especially in times of crisis and uncertainty, seek not analysis but certainty, not reflection but guidance.  \nThe intelligent person sees confusion where others see a straight line. He understands that each decision entails a series of different consequences. That there is a context, compromises, probability.  \nThe intelligent person seems cold, incomprehensible, difficult to the crowd. They avoid him, their ideas are ignored. He says: \"We need to wait and calculate everything.\" And the other says: \"Let's do it quickly and simply like this.\"  \n\nSo guess who they'll listen to.  \nPower requires speed, charisma, and simplicity. And people need the illusion of confidence. In a world where public perception is shaped not by knowledge but by impression, confidence is the currency of influence. And the louder a person speaks, the more he believes in his [primitive] words, even if they are false, the higher his chances of being recognized as a leader. This is the essence of the Dunning-Kruger effect, a cognitive distortion in which people with a low level of competence tend to greatly overestimate their abilities, while real experts, on the contrary, often doubt their conclusions.  \nWhen a person says: \"I know exactly how to solve a problem,\" people willingly follow him, without demanding evidence.  \nAnd when a smart person cautiously says: \"This is a complex situation, there are many nuances here\" - people perceive this as weakness.  \nThis effect is especially noticeable in politics. A charismatic, loud, self-confident person inspires trust, even if he is completely incompetent. We see this always and everywhere, including in business and in the media.\nAnd those who think too long, who formulate too precisely, who look at the world too soberly, are simply not noticed. As Shakespeare wrote, \"A fool is confident in his wisdom, and a wise man knows that he is a fool.\"\nThe more stupid a person is, the more confident he is. The more confident he is, the more convincing he sounds. The more convincing he is, the more often he is perceived as a leader. Self-confidence is equated with competence.  \nLeaders do not become those who know more, but those who speak as if they know everything. And this is a trap.  \nConfidence is contagious. People perceive it as truth.  The human brain tends to save energy, trusting superficial signs - confidence, a decisive look, categoricalness. All this gives the illusion of power, but behind it often lies emptiness or even danger. Thus, self-confident but incompetent people get to the top.\nAnd then the question arises: what happens when such trumps get power? How do they hold on to it and why do they build entire networks of mediocrity around themselves?   \nMachiavelli gives the answer. When a self-confident but incompetent person gets power, the most destructive thing begins.  \nHe seeks not to improve the system, but to subordinate it to himself. And the surest way to gain a foothold at the top is to surround himself with even weaker people. \nMachiavelli wrote: \"The first way to judge the intelligence of a ruler is to see who he surrounds himself with.\" This phrase opens our eyes to how mediocrity reproduces itself, turning into a system. A weak leader is afraid of the strong. He cannot stand competition, even if it is useful. Therefore, instead of competent and intelligent, he selects loyal and obedient. Instead of those who can offer constructive criticism, those who will nod. Instead of those who are able to solve the problem, those who know how to hide it. This is how a chain reaction begins. Incompetence, having settled at the top, spreads downwards, turning the entire system into a swamp of mediocrity.  \nSuch a leader does not strengthen the system, he undermines it from within. He is afraid of honest feedback. He is afraid of those who know more. He is afraid of those who can be the best. And therefore he stifle development at the root. Thus, a lack of competence arises in the system. Next to a mediocre leader, an \"ecosystem\" of mediocrity arises, closed to criticism and impervious to the truth.  \nThis is not slander against Trump - this is a reality that has been repeated in history countless times. And when crises arise, such Trump-Putin systems do not hold up. They have no depth, no expertise, no flexibility. Only a chain of mutual fears and illusions, and in the center - a pathetic leader who fears the truth more than defeat. And even knowing all this, society again and again tends to elect just such people.  \nBut why do people follow those who offer easy solutions, who speak loudly, who do not allow doubts? The answer to this question should be sought not in Trump, but in the human psyche. The fact that there is an idiot at the top of power in the USA is not Trump's fault. But this is a topic for another conversation.  ",

        "body": "Yes modern democracy is still quite “new”, but you have to remember that it’s a response to changes in geopolitics as well as domestic realities. One of the biggest changes of “recent” history, meaning like the 1700-2000s, is that people started to move around a lot more. Before ~1700 few people travelled beyond their own village, unless paid to be in an army sent to war. This limited movement meant that economies were exceptionally reliant on small tribes of people who worked well together, markets between villages were very basic and didn’t really produce much economic value to the ruling class. In the time of the Romans you had just a handful of large cities, and these were fed by slavery from surrounding lands. It was unusual to have plural societies where productivity was coupled with the ability for unrelated peoples to travel. This changed as populations grew and by the 1700s you see new empires start to rise based not on what can be produced locally by serfs in villages, but by merchants sailing the world and buying up land and goods in far off places. The British Empire was built on the concept of colonization, meaning you built new colonies specifically for the purpose of producing something that could earn money for the Crown. This required moving unrelated peoples, or convincing them to move on their own, to create a new population that would produce these goods. That was really the start of Capitalism. The Nobility would fund expeditions, found colonies and make themselves and supporting merchant class partners richer and more powerful. \n\n\nCreating colonies wasn’t easy though, and failed more often than not. Among the difficulties were where to find willing people to populate the new colony, and how to ensure they lived together productively. Lots of colonies failed simply because they couldn’t get along with each other and act as a unified tribe. The Nobility of the time would try to source as many people from the same geographical region as possible, as this meant they had similar cultures, but that wasn’t always cost effective or practical. Mixing cultures and peoples became a necessity for success. \n\n\n\nFast forward to today and we have the modern versions of Democracy and Capitalism specifically created for the purposes of Colonization. The systems are designed to create stability amongst a plural society. The benefits, economically, are the reason the West still dominates and remains stable. Compared to China who are intent on building a “Han” society through oppressing minorities out of existence, we are still quite a bit more successful on a per-capita basis. China mainly succeeds because they just have soooo many Han chinese to build their economy on top of. Long term though they will simply run into the same limitations that the early British Empire ran into, you simply can’t produce enough people of a single culture to grow a national economic into a global economy. \n\n\n\nAnd that, my friend, is why I don’t think “managed democracy” will actually be the better system. The mistake that many leaders make is in thinking they what’s better for someone than that person does for themselves. Managed Democracy is just another way of giving up on negotiating the needs of a plural society, and trying to force a certain cultural standard that doesn’t work for everyone. Ultimately what it creates is stagnation and limited economic productivity. The empire that better succeeds at economic productivity is always the long term winner. In a world of dense populations, you’re just better off negotiating cultural divides to get people to work together than you are by trying to rely on a singular culture. Now, if we suddenly had a population collapse and went back to pre-1700s population numbers then I expect we would end revisiting those ideas.",

This attack marks a new epoch in military history. Ukraine claims to have destroyed and damaged over 40 aircraft, including priceless, irreplaceable Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers which Russia no longer has the ability to produce. So far satellite imagery has confirmed the destruction of at least 19 aircraft. There are many historic aspects of this attack, but one of the most significant is that this is the first time in history that a significant part of a nation's nuclear triad has been destroyed. This changes the game in term of Russia's nuclear deterrence on a global strategic level, as well as on the strategic level within Ukraine. While I've seen some legitimate questions about whether or not some of the planes destroyed were not being actively used, the fact that, as you can see in the video, the planes were fueled and went up in flames, at least some of them were being staged for a massive cruise missile attack that was due to begin on June 1st and has now been called off. I also want to highlight that two A-50 recon planes were also destroyed or heavily damaged in this attack, Russia only has a couple of those planes left now, and they are incredibly important for Russia's ability to see the entire battlefield.\n* Ukrainian special forces also detonated some kind of bomb under the Kerch straight bridge between Crimea and Russia. It's unclear how much damage was done to the bridge, but Russia claims traffic has already resumed, though they may be lying.\n* Trump then spoke on the phone with Putin and said on social media that Putin said he would retaliate, even as he gave zero indication that he had pushed back in any way on this.\n* Ukrainian forces claimed that for the first time they were able to destroy a Russian Iskander ballistic missile system. Russia uses these systems to strike Ukraine constantly, including an attack last week that killed 12 Ukrainian soldiers and injured 60 more. While the loss of one system is not necessarily a huge blow, these systems are kept deep behind the lines, so it's great that Ukraine has found a way to find and attack them.\n* House speaker Mike Johnson came out publicly in support of tough sanctions on Russia and said there was strong support in Congress for such a bill. Even as Trump completely abdicates any role he might play in bringing this bill up, there is such a strong desire in Congress for hurting Russia that this might happen without him.\n* Many different European nations have announced different big aid packages for Ukraine, with many of them focusing on providing funding for weapons production within Ukraine. Ukraine is also in talks with the US to use some of this money to buy American weapons under the terms of the minerals deal that was signed.\n* Russian casualties are nearing the awful milestone of 1 million, with likely 250,000 of these casualties being deaths, while the others are injured. This is a truly stunning number. Ukrainian casualties meanwhile are likely around 400,000, with just under 100,000 of these being deaths.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,045 (+77)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,037 (+8)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,011 (+14)\n* Russian SPG losses: 945 (+3)\n* Russian SAM losses: 334 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 155 (+14)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,067 (+50)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,195 (+1)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,385 (+9)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 958 (+9)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 566 (+5)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nLight losses on both sides, with the obvious caveat that Russia lost more aircraft confirmed on Oryx this week than at any time in the entire course of the war. In total during the war, Ukraine has now destroyed 11 Tu-22s, 8 Tu-95s, and 2 A-50s. Russia started with 57 Tu-22s, 55 Tu-95, and between 6 and 8 A-50s, so those are all significant percentages of the fleets, especially when you consider that even many active planes might not necessarily be operable.\n\nThank you for reading!",

And in an unexpected turn of events, earlier today [Trump posted](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114626401432609274) that this bill \"can give Trump the leverage to coerce Putin\" with a link to a favorable [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/05/29/congress-russia-sanctions-trump-putin/).\n\nWhether Trump really supports this bill remains to be seen, but the floodgates of support for the Sanctioning Russia Act have opened. Several other Republican offices have confirmed today that they submitted cosponsorship and will appear on the list shortly. Since cosponsors are only being accepted in pairs (one Democrat and one Republican) and there's already a waitlist of willing Democrats, each new Republican cosponsor will result in two cosponsors.\n\nThe time to act is now. Especially if you have a Republican House member, [contact their office using the American Coalition for Ukraine's easy tool](https://ujoin.co/campaigns/3788/actions/public?action_id=5398). Tell them that their voters demand action.",

    "selftext": "Russia is set to lose one million soldiers by the end of this summer. June 2025 is shaping up to be a disastrous month for Russia and its war against Ukraine — not only due to unprecedented drone attacks on strategic bombers and surveillance aircraft or sabotage on the Kerch Bridge, which have angered and alarmed the Kremlin.\n\nAs *The Economist* reports, by the end of the first summer month, Russia is likely to surpass one million troops killed or wounded. “The data suggest Russia is performing poorly on the battlefield,” experts write in the report. In Kharkiv, for example, Russian forces have been advancing at an average pace of just 50 meters per day — slower than British and French troops in World War I, who moved about 80 meters daily. According to author Seth G. Jones of CSIS, Russia’s campaign in Ukraine is on track to become one of the slowest offensive operations in modern warfare.\n\nBut the most shocking statistic is the scale of Russian casualties.\n\n“Russia is likely to reach the milestone of one million casualties in summer 2025 — a staggering and horrifying figure,” states the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). According to the think tank, around 250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, and total casualties exceed 950,000.\n\nThis, the authors argue, reflects Putin’s blatant disregard for the lives of his troops. “Placed in historical context, Russia has suffered about five times more casualties in Ukraine than in all Russian and Soviet wars combined from the end of World War II until the full-scale invasion in 2022,” they add.\n\nCompared to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which lasted a decade, Russia’s losses in Ukraine are 15 times higher, and 10 times more than in the 13-year-long war in Chechnya. Increased Western support has only added to Russia’s burdens. According to the study, the most critical factors have been tactical missile systems (ATACMS), HIMARS rocket artillery, 155mm shells, air defense systems, and intelligence sharing. All of this has crippled Russia’s offensive — without the U.S. losing a single soldier.\n\nExperts argue that the issue isn’t whether the U.S. holds the cards, but that it hasn’t played them decisively enough — failing to apply real economic and military pressure. As the study concludes, “Without serious pain, Putin will continue to stall peace talks, prolong the fighting, and wait for the U.S. to back down.”\n\nPutin can afford these losses in part because many of the killed and wounded soldiers are from the Russian Far East or recruited from prisons — not, as the analysis notes, the sons of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites.\n\nFor Russia, the war in Ukraine is turning into a historic catastrophe — militarily, demographically, and geopolitically. The losses surpass those of all previous modern Russian conflicts and reveal a regime sinking deeper into isolation, unwilling to retreat even at the cost of massive human suffering.   \n  \nThe war is no longer about victory, but about the survival of a regimes, democracy and freedom.\n\nSource: www.csis.org",

Finally, the US and Europe should remove all restrictions on the use of weapons supplied and supply Ukraine the training and equipment they need to retake captured Ukrainian territory.

It neutralized 41 “strategic aircraft” and was a brilliant technical performance.\n\nOver more than 18 months, hundreds of drones were smuggled deep into Russia. They were loaded onto civilian trucks with double-bottomed trailers, where they were concealed inside mobile boxes. The tops of those boxes—remotely controlled by operators in Ukraine but connected to the Russian telephone network—opened at the appointed time, allowing the drones to take off. All 41 targets were carefully studied for months by Ukrainian intelligence, and they exploded simultaneously without civilian casualties.\n\nThis is the Ukrainian equivalent of the September 2024 pager attack in which Israel annihilated nearly all of Hezbollah’s active forces. It is one of those operations of crazy audacity and unparalleled ingenuity that make military history. It will be taught for ages in war schools.\n\nThis achievement was a slap in the face to Russia—and not the first. At the beginning of the war, there was the Moskva cruiser, the flagship of its fleet, sunk off Odesa by two Ukrainian-made missiles. Then, the double strike on the Kerch Bridge, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin)’s pride, the jewel of his cardboard crown and a symbol of the continuity he believed he was establishing between Crimea and Russia. Last year, half of Mr. Putin’s fleet in the Black Sea was destroyed. The other half retreated pitifully to Novorossiysk or the Sea of Azov. Also in 2024, Ukraine staged an offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.\n\nSigmund Freud spoke of the three humiliations on Western man—inflicted by Copernicus, Darwin and Freud himself. If Volodymyr Zelensky had the heart to laugh, he could speak of the five humiliations he has inflicted on that enemy of the West: Russia. Mr. Putin and his people stand exposed as braggarts, paper tigers. Ukraine is David to the Goliath of Russia, nearly 30 times its size.",

For another film, the drone battalions of Lyman and Kupiansk closed the sky in place of their overly timid allies. This winter, in Pokrovsk and Sumy, high-tech command rooms where battles were fought at a distance. I even heard—at the time without fully understanding—Mr. Zelensky announcing that his engineers were developing a new generation of drones capable of striking Russia up to the Arctic.\n\nToday, all the cards are turned. Mr. Putin terrorized the world with his nuclear blackmail. There was an army capable of calling his bluff—and it did.\n\n“Just say thank you,” Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jd-vance) lectured President Zelensky during their February altercation in the Oval Office. All of us should thank Ukraine, a small nation that has grounded a third of the bombers that promised apocalypse to Warsaw, Berlin or Paris.\n\nThis weekend’s drone operation is a further step on the path to victory. I don’t know what form that victory will take, or whether it will be the front, the rear or its regime that will give in first in Russia. But the balance of power is increasingly clear.\n\nOn one side, a ridiculed general staff, an ultimate weapon that is greatly diminished and discredited, troops so demoralized that they fight only with the support of North Korean, Chinese, Ghanaian, Bangladeshi and Iranian mercenaries.\n\nOn the other side, a patriotic citizen army, motivated and knowing why it combats—an army that has proved its mastery of the most advanced military technologies, its excellence not only in trench warfare but also in the new remote and ghost warfare.\n\nUkraine will defeat Russia on the battlefield or impose the terms of a just peace. Either way it will win the war.\n\n*Mr. Lévy is author of “Israel Alone” and director of the Ukraine documentary “Our War,” forthcoming June 11.

Vulnerable nuclear powers are more dangerous because they have limited options for retaliatory strikes. Which means they are more likely to error on the side of shooting first. At least that’s the argument.\n\nAlso, Ukraine is absolutely not a US ally in Trumps view. None of Europe is but Ukraine, and Zelensky who Trump absolutely viscerally hates, are not allies to Trump.

Launches against him, WMD used on Russia, attacks on his nukes/triad, and attempts to depose the regime. \n\nUkraine just blatantly did the third in the face of his stated nuckear doctrine, and kicked out the lion’s share of one of the legs of his triad, asking him “waccha gonna do?”.\n\nThe answer is of course nothing. The second he launches anything and a vague threat becomes quantified, its effectiveness reduces to near nil. He can’t afford to. \n\n**That** is what a weaken America strategy got Putin. It cost him his nuclear deterrence.\n\nMay he keep figuring out new and wonderful ways to strengthen Europe.\n\n“Strategy in tatters” doesn’t begin to cover this.

This is by far the most dangerous area of the front right now, and it's not good that Ukraine seems to be having a lot of trouble with containing Russian advances here.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suvxd1aldq3f1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8cb63ca4458ab1e13bdb6f334f96b4488ca25be\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk4k1nyldq3f1.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48923114cff7f1f97be706a85342002e91edd384\n\n* Russian troops advanced again north and west of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump made several disparaging posts about Putin on Truth Social, including making a barely veiled threat that things would be much worse for Russia if it wasn't for him (not exactly the brag that he might think it is). He did also needlessly criticize Zelensky again in one of these posts and said he would give Putin another two weeks to come to the table with a real deal before he starts pursuing sanctions. It is beyond pathetic that he keeps making these strong statements only to follow them up with more appeasement and lack of real pressure, but I do think that at some point he will fully realize that Putin has been playing him this whole time.\n* Russia, meanwhile, is \"negotiating\" by hitting Ukraine with bigger and bigger drone and missile strikes each week, killing civilians and making peace more difficult.\n* Ukraine is, however, able to respond with large, damaging drone strikes of their own, including a direct hit on a factory that makes cruise missile components a few days ago. Ukraine's long range drone strike capability keeps getting better and better, and I do think that at some point in the next few months it will reach a tipping point where they have degraded Russian air defense stockpiles enough that they will be able to really do significant damage to the Russian war effort with these strikes.\n* Ukrainian reports have indicated that Russia continues to produce more and more strike drones, and they may soon be able to launch 500 per day, which would be very difficult for Ukraine to counter.\n* German Chancellor Merz announced that in consultation with the other Western allies, all restrictions on range for the use of Western weapons in Ukraine have been lifted. This could soon be followed up by an announcement that Germany is delivering Taurus missiles to Ukraine (though this could also happen without an announcement). Germany also said they were beginning their process of greatly stepping up military aid to Ukraine, including a large multi-billion-dollar package that is being sent right now.\n* One report I saw this week claims that Russia has been able to modify its Iskander ballistic missiles to make them harder to target, both by allowing them to make course modifications in flight and using radar decoys that the missile is able to launch itself. We've seen some more successful Iskander strikes in the last few weeks including one on Ukrainian troops training in the open (which should never have been allowed to happen), and these modifications might play a big part in that. In war, if you're not constantly improving your stuff, you're losing, and that idea is not lost on either the Russians or the Ukrainians.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,968 (+163)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,029 (+42)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,997 (+37)\n* Russian SPG losses: 942 (+6)\n* Russian SAM losses: 332 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 141 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+1)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,017 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,194 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,376 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 949 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 561 (+5)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nA bit of a return to the mean today, with Russian losses spiking heavily due to their offensive, including one of the highest weekly tank losses I've seen since I started this project. Ukrainian losses are still relatively high but are now dwarfed by Russian ones.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading and for your support!

It's insane they think they can take a major city back like Kherson. \nIt's sad that 1-2 losses aren't sustainable for Ukraine as those are impressive given they have to rely on a smaller economy. The upside is that Ukraine lost primarily cheaper IMV's that can be made from civilian donations while Russia primarily lost expensive vehicles. \n\n\nPay attention what leaders do not what they say- Trump is just leading everyone on.  The assumed position should be that he doesn't want to do sanctions and that threats should be ignored. Hopefully Europe picks up some slack. The TACO comments might help here. ",

If Putin took that bait, he would look very weak; in the eyes of the world Trump would look superior in comparison. So that was never going to happen...obviously!

Martial and military minds. The best of those are probably unknown to him, because he surrounds himself with wrestling showmen, and not the quiet unassuming but brilliant minds of the very rare , disciplined strategists that the genuine  martial arts disciplines embody.",

Trumps fragile ego couldn't stand the thought of losing another election, so he took an offer from Putin to collab on winning the presidency for him. Putin let his agents pay off the influencers and media personalities, Trump promised to not investigate it once he had the power he wanted.\n\nTrump is paying back Putin right now, for helping him win the election. It's becoming increasingly obvious. Trump is talking about lifting sanctions on russia. He can't make it too obvious, so he keeps saying \"the war is terrible\", but never says who started it. Also never actually does anything to stop it, or to punish russia for starting it, or for continuing their attacks on Ukrainian civilians.\n\nTrump is in debt to Putin.",

The attack killed 12 people, including three children, and injured more than 60, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.\n\nRescuers worked in more than 30 Ukrainian villages and cities, reacting to the large-scale attack, Zelensky said. More than 22 direct strikes were recorded, with additional regions affected by falling debris, the Air Force said.\n\n\"Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will definitely help,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on Telegram on May 25.\n\n\"The world knows all the weaknesses of the Russian economy. It is possible to stop the war, but only through the necessary force of pressure on Russia. Putin must be forced to think not about launching missiles, but about ending the war.\"",

Pokrovsk is now threatened with encirclement, and the defense of Toretsk may also be put in jeopardy by these advances. Things are very precarious in this area at the moment, and Ukraine needs to send in some reserves to stabilize the situation ASAP.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vfo5rddic2f1.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80edfecda45ccd4cefba79f45a600f32d356070b\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7a6rorpeic2f1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e921cf9799e30f0f7797871720c464107e6ce83e\n\n* Russia advanced north of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump had a two-hour conversation on the phone with Putin this week. He spoke with the leaders of several European nations and Zelensky immediately afterwards, where he shocked them all by saying that Putin was now ready to begin negotiations even though Ukrainian and Russian diplomats had already met in Turkey last week to start those discussions. He also repeated baseless statements that Russia is winning the war, and, according to the Washington Post, privately told officials that Putin actually has no interest in coming to the table. It is totally unclear what Trump is actually pursuing, or who's side he is on, and the common adage about him that he parrots whatever the last person he spoke to said to him seems to be holding true here. But if there's one thing that has become abundantly clear, it's that Trump's entire negotiating \"strategy\" if you can even say there has been one, has been a complete failure and has made him look like even more of an idiot than he already did.\n* In a show of how little Russia cares about Trump's peace overtures, they launched their largest drone strike ever against Ukraine the night of May 17th, killing civilians and causing damage all over the country even though many of the drones were shot down.\n* In response, Ukraine launched what some reports have said is their largest drone attack against Russia ever, with hundreds of drones shutting down the Moscow airport and hitting oil refineries in Ryazan. One thing I do wonder is to what extent these mass attacks are causing attrition to Russian stocks of air defense missiles. Their stocks are obviously very deep, but you can only shoot down hundreds of drones a week for so long. I haven't seen any indications yet that they are having trouble supplying their AD units, but it's something I'm watching for, especially as Ukraine continues to produce more and more drones.\n* Pro-Ukraine candidate Nicosur Dan won the presidential election in Romania against the pro-Russia and anti-Europe candidate George Simeon. This is a big win for Ukraine as Romania is a very important base for incoming aid and is one of the only EU countries that shares a border with Ukraine. The Romanian parliament then also passed a bill allowing their military to shoot down Russian drones that enter their airspace.\n* New polling from Harvard/Harris shows that a solid majority, 62%, of Americans support continued military aid deliveries to Ukraine.\n* EU nations agreed in principle to a $170 billion dollar fund to finance European defense. The money will be raised by EU level borrowing and then loaned to countries (including Ukraine) for the purposes of strengthening their national defense and arms industries. This is a lot of money, and if it's spent wisely could have a significant effect.\n* Meanwhile Denmark, which is easily one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine in Europe, announced another big aid package for Ukraine, worth $600 million dollars, containing self-propelled guns, artillery ammunition, and parts for F-16s, all very important contributions.\n* Some of the 49 Australian M1 Abrams tanks promised by that country are already in Ukraine, while the rest are on their way. This is more tanks than the US gave when it sent Abrams, though the Abrams has not exactly been a game changer, and the logistical problems it comes with are significant. But more relatively modern Western tanks are still desperately needed, so this shipment is very welcome.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,805 (+48)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,987 (+4)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,960 (+24)\n* Russian SPG losses: 936 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 331 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 141 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,940 (+67)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,184 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,372 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 932 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 556 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nRelatively light losses on both sides this week, though it's never good to see the Russians have fewer losses than the Ukrainians. I expect numbers on both sides, and particularly for the Russians, to rise greatly next week as the Russians launch more attacks.",

China is already waiting to invade Taiwan, and are slowly stepping up support for the Russians. They don't want to see Russia lose the war, and open European involvement could easily push them to both step up their military and financial support for Russia and accelerate their timeline for invading Taiwan, which would potentially trigger a US response, and there you go, World War 3. \n\nAlso, European nations directly fighting on the front lines in Ukraine would mean Russia would have the right to attack European military bases with missiles. Then one of those countries triggers NATO article 5, and there you go, World War 3 again.\n\nI understand that doesn't feel fair to you. And you're right, it's not fair.

This includes phasing out liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by the same deadline, according to Euronews. Germany has already declared its independence from Russian energy, with Norway now being the dominant supplier of gas to the country. \nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\nEU Efforts:\nThe EU is actively working to diversify its energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and accelerate the deployment of renewable energy. They have also set a goal of phasing out all Russian gas imports by 2027. \nGermany's Transition:\nGermany has made significant strides in reducing its reliance on Russian energy, with Norway now being the primary gas supplier. \nSanctions and Embargoes:\nThe EU has imposed sanctions and embargoes on Russian oil and refined petroleum products, impacting Russia's revenues. \nImpact on Russia:\nThe EU's move away from Russian energy has had a substantial impact on Russia's economy, as the EU used to be a major buyer of Russian oil and gas. \nAlternative Suppliers:\nEU countries are diversifying their energy sources, relying more on countries like the United States, Norway, and Kazakhstan for oil and gas",

It also ran counter to what Trump has often said publicly, that he believes Putin genuinely wants peace.*\n\n*The White House declined to comment and referred to Trump’s social-media post on Monday about his conversation with Putin. “The tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent. If it wasn’t, I would say so now,” he said.*\n\n*Although Trump appears to have come around to the idea that Putin isn’t ready for peace, that hasn’t led him to do what the Europeans and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been arguing he should do: double down on the fight against Russia.*",

Partially, Trump does it this so that in the event of peace, he can claim all of the credit for it to the annoyance of the parties as in India/Pakistan.

Putin seems to think he is fighting Anglo-America and the EU. He plans around assumptions that are fever dreams. Because Putin refuses to accept the simple idea that Ukrainian nationalism exists. \n\n**Putin is fighting Ukraine. And here his strategy seems like nonsense**. Motivation matters in war, where soldiers are expected to make the largest sacrifice. Nationalists fighting with backs to the wall against imperialists have a very clear war aim. They usually have higher motivation and staying power, especially in the modern age of mass media and self-determination expectations. Historically, if I was betting on this sad war, odds say Ukraine can outlast one old tyrant. If Russia’s conscripts refuse to die in Ukraine, Russia loses.

Time in control, time alive, time to keep playing things along to see if something breaks his way unexpectedly, time to delay the Russian people realizing just how horrifically he has fucked them and thus avoiding them rising up to murder him just like the Libyans did to Qaddafi, who died like a dog in a ditch. He has pushed things so far that there simply is no graceful way to back down with inviting unrest and regime instability.\n\nFundamentally, Putin is holding out because he thinks he can get a better deal entering peace negotiations at some point in the future (or never) than he can get right now. The costs to him of peace include increased regime insecurity. The benefits of the peace are limited to a fraction of what he hoped to achieve in Ukraine and represent a crushing humiliation for Russia compared to the expectations for their military performance pre-2022. The costs of continuing war are just more dead, ordinary poor Russians that Putin doesn't care about. The benefits include opportunities to seize more land and resources while further destabilizing the western political order that Putin so deeply fears and despises. He also maintains wartime control over the Russian people, including extraordinary powers over propaganda and internal security that represent dramatically curtailed civil rights for ordinary Russians compared to the much greater freedoms they enjoyed a mere 15 years ago, or even just before the full scale invasion, after which the Russian security services started tightening the screws on dissent aggressively. Also, the more soldiers that die on the front, the fewer veterans the Russian state will have to pay to rehabilitate, and the fewer potential disaffected Decemberist-style revolutionaries to threaten his regime. \n\nAnd right at this particular moment, the US negotiating strategy is remarkably stupid, in that it not only does not remove Putin's incentive to hold out, rather it actually enhances that incentive greatly. Trump has presented Putin with a win-win situation if he delays negotiating longer. Either he receives further concessions from Trump as Trump desperately struggles to bribe Putin to agree to a ceasefire, or Trump gets angry and washes his hands of the situation, leaving Ukraine and Europe at large with substantially reduced American security support and involvement. Either result would be an enormous victory for Putin.\n\nPutin would **love**--and in fact **is loving**--to see the US withdraw from participating in European security by rhetorically and financially backing away from its support for Ukraine and for NATO, while drawing down the US troop presence on the continent. He sees the western order fracturing, with Europe too weak to stand up for itself and America too broken and stupid to protect the world order it created and which has ensured its geopolitical hegemony for decades. Why negotiate with an opponent who is in the middle of a self-destructing? If holding out only either increases the likelihood of the US abandoning Ukraine and Europe or of Russia receiving inordinate concessions from Trump, there's absolutely no reason for Putin to settle now, and plenty of reason to want to delay.",

It is not _just_ bots.\n\nThe way I see it is, yes, the US is a huge disappointment, but the combination of increased domestic production of weapons in Ukraine, the increase in production and donation from European countries, and the mostly European funded projects like the Czech ammunition initiative makes this mostly a moot point. The gap is anti air ammunition, and primarily Patriot missiles. At the same time that the influx of arms seems to actually significantly increase, russia is showing signs of actually in practice having run out of readily fixable equipment from soviet storage. Explaining the massive numbers in \"vehicles\" lost compared to tanks/IFVs/APCs. Ukraine has a formidable experience and drone army, and the current attempts at armored breakthroughs have been thoroughly smashed. The russian loss rates for each square meter gained has been steadily rising. Ukraine is heading towards artillery parity in available ammunition, and russia has never managed to make any significant captures without massive artillery dominance. So I, as a first rate armchair general, don't see any other outcome of the famed \"russian summer offensive\" than a failure, and a final culmination of the russian offensive actions. As long as Ukraine holds on, and support continues, the situation for russia will only get worse.\n\nSo why is the russian propaganda so effective?",

The way I see it, Putin will make the mistake in challenging that and will give Trump the reason to support Ukraine and pressure Russia. \n\nThis will leave Russia with the following options:\n- total war\n- not total war but committing more resources and more people\n- find other partners to assist with resources and negotiations \n- giving up his demands\n\n\nAll this is dependent on China. I’m not sure of supporting Russia will be beneficial to their long term plan. \n\nJust my thoughts.",

Only Russian nationalists (e.g. Dugin) have been sufficiently honest (in a dark way) or shameless to express this attitude consistently and out loud.\n\nAs a rule, Russians have no problems with Ukrainians *as long as* Russians get to feed, actively or passively, their foundational self-entitlement [as \"first among equals\" in East Slavdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Russian_nation), in addition to bearing the *indisputable freedom* to work towards achieving [their \"Final Solution\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification_of_Ukraine). In the current generations of Russians, there was *nothing* really wrong with the Ukrainian SSR since it was indisputably subordinate to the Russian SFSR anchored at Moscow as entire rotten empire's metropole.\n\nIn the context of the Russians' latest attempt at exterminating the Ukrainians, Putin and the majority of his compatriots are OK with peace when, at bare minimum, the Ukrainians end up living in a rump-state that's stripped of any credible military defense.\n\n&gt;*...there is the view that the very idea of Russia without Little Russia, or Ukraine is inconceivable. The dean of twentieth-century Russian specialists of Kievan Rus', Dmitrii Likhachev, best summed up this attitude: \"Over the course of the centuries following their division into two entities, Russia and Ukraine have formed not only a political by also a culturally dualistic unity.* ***Russian culture is meaningless without Ukrainian, as Ukrainian is without Russian.***\n\nFrom Magocsi, P.R. \"A History of Ukraine: The Land and its Peoples\", 2010\n\nIn a bigger sense, how can Russians in their current state *ever* leave Ukrainians alone when so many of the former keep infecting themselves with a pathologically violent form of separation anxiety?\n\nIn the beady eyes of so many Russians (including a scholar like Likhachev), when Ukrainians begin to \"go astray\" by strengthening ties with the apostate Protestants and Catholics of Europe, then why *shouldn't* the oh-so-benevolent and \"peaceful\" Orthodox Russians ~~\"denazify\"~~ exterminate Ukrainians to preserve their own (i.e. The Orthodox Russians') self-imagined purity and sanctity?\n\nIt's all founded on Russians' ahistorical fixation that Ukrainians and Russians are ultimately one people with one culture. It follows that the growth or flourishing of Ukrainians and their culture must then be automatically detrimental to the Russians and theirs. This infantile thinking is in line with Russians' primitive view of life as a zero-sum game in which Ukrainians' success in anything *must* have been at the Russians' expense, and so the latter are therefore \"justified\" to take offense and lash out in vengeance.\n\nThese facts shatter the views of Russophiles in the West who still can't bring themselves to admit that their longstanding sympathy and fascination for Russia, Russians, and Russian \"culture\" have obliquely enabled a ~~nation~~ ~~empire~~ **transcontinental extortion racket** whose ~~citizens~~ minions have waged a centuries-long *jihad* against the Ukrainians and the rest of the civilized world which combines the depravity of the МоngоІ hordes and the self-righteousness of ISIS.",

Yet still the missing language was also possible to be pure bad management.\n\nI'm guessing that there are at least a couple reasons for this belated introduction of a translation module for Ukrainian - even a clumsy one that's based on AI or machine translation.\n\nA lot of Ukrainian refugees in the EU are native speakers of Russian, de facto monoglots of Russian (i.e. their knowledge of Ukrainian is useless for anything more than listening or reading comprehension) or can understand Russian enough such that translations to Ukrainian aren't necessary at the outset (or they just aren't high on their priorities as refugees). In a sinister victory for Russian chauvinism, Russification has succeeded in varying degrees among Ukrainians *outside* the western oblasts such that Ukrainians regardless of education level in the central, south and east have long used Russian as their **native** language with Ukrainian being at most a second language that's learned to varying degrees in elementary and high school.\n\nIf you were the average bureaucrat in the EU whose knowledge of Europe basically ends along the Finnish Lakelands, Oder, Sudetes, Leitha, and Adriatic Sea, [chances are that you and your ancestors are ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westsplaining) of the \"pleasure\" of the Russians' \"friendship\" or the \"marvels\" of Russian \"culture\". What could possibly be wrong, let alone offensive, about validating a language whose very relevance is inextricably related to a genocide on your doorstep by not offering support in a language that's been under attack by genocidal minions who work ruthlessly and violently to advance that language at outsiders' expense?\n\nThis insidiously methodical strangulation of Ukrainian ultimately suits the \"civilized\" Russians *just fine* as it reinforces their foundational arrogance in which Russian is *the* language of \"civilization\" compared to Ukrainian. In this lens, Ukrainian is akin to an aboriginal language like Navajo is relative to English, and at best would be acceptable for use in local folklore or some obscure poetry as a kind of tokenism that plays up the Russians' contrived tolerance of anything non-Russian while being used to sugar-coat their blood-soaked chauvinism, colonialism, and imperialism.\n\nYou can tell that it's no accident that a people who wants absolutely nothing to do with the direct spawn of the GоІdеn Ноrdе's staunchest ~~collaborators~~ *bootlickers* so readily continues to use the language of those bootlickers' spawn.\n\nRussification is just a helluva drug and is arguably on par with, or even *worse* than, the much longer-lasting phenomena of [Hispanicization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanicization#Hispanic_America) in the New World.",

In a similar vein, note how the discourse on colonization invariably draws examples and analysis based on the history of exploration and colonization by a handful of *western European* nations (by extension too the Americans and Canadians as they stemmed initially from colonists out of Britain and France).\n\nIn contrast, there's been practically nothing about the [Russians' unchecked colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_Russia#Table_of_changes) oozing out of the swamps along the northern tributaries of the Volga starting almost immediately after the self-coronation of Ivan the Terrible in 1547. This myopia suits the Russians *just fine* no matter how progressive, educated, Westernized, or liberal some of them consider themselves. It's darkly funny how it's general knowledge that the Russians have the biggest country for a \"homeland\" but practically no one has asked how their ancestors originating from the swamps along the Moskva river on the northeastern fringe of Europe somehow lord over a ~~homeland~~ **transcontinental extortion racket** that currently hogs 11 time zones from the Baltic to the Pacific.  \n\nIt's arguably the largest and most heinous intellectual scam out there with generation after generation of **non**\\-Russians paying for it with their lives, culture, and dignity. The Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, and Georgians of the 21st century are only the latest generations of victims of the Russians' single-mindedness in perpetuating what their spirit animals of the GоІdеn Ноrdе demonstrated 800 years ago.\n\nHas it been so because the Russians could merely goose-step their way past the Urals and all the way to the Pacific and Arctic Oceans which has let them off the hook compared to the western Europeans who needed rickety ships for their colonization?

For example, the president tells us that he is fighting the oligarchs, then awards those same oligarchs with medals ‘For Service to the Country.’ Or the government tells us that prices for consumer goods will not rise, and a month later they double. Or the church teaches us that greed is a sin and ‘it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,’ while the Patriarch rides in a motorcade and befriends the rich and mighty. Or officials tell us that there are no Russian soldiers in Ukraine, while the media talks constantly about Russia’s military successes on the Ukrainian front.*\n\n&gt;*In this atmosphere, people cease to differentiate between the literal and the metaphorical, suspecting intrigue where there is none and, conversely, losing the ability to read between the lines. The acceptance of contradictions is enforced by social pressure: believers are not supposed to criticise priests, tax-payers are not supposed to criticise the government, and criticism of Putin is tantamount to treason.*\n\n&gt;*To offset the more glaring contradictions, a number of deputies, clergy and cultural figures regularly voice deliberately unacceptable statements and propose ridiculous initiatives to shock the public, so that they can be graciously declined by higher powers. Legislative initiatives in this form include proposals to ban abortions, to punish homosexual acts, to make military service obligatory for childless women over the age of twenty-three, to deprive people of Russian citizenship if they marry a foreigner, to sentence mothers who go to beach resorts without their husbands to ten years in prison, to limit bad news on television to ten per cent of broadcast time, to prohibit the teaching of evolution in schools, and so on. Never knowing the real intentions of the authorities, and forever expecting that one of the new insane laws will be passed, the people are left depressed and indifferent to their fate.*\n\n&gt;*All that remains for those ashamed of the present and afraid of the future is pride in the past.* ***When there’s no reason to love your country, hate your neighbours. If you are unable to improve your life, ruin someone else’s.***",

Russia started this war with the intention to occupy and subjugate all of Ukraine, and they still have not given up this goal even after more than three years of war (as stated explicitly and repeatedly in the russian state TV shows that 'Russian Media Monitor' presents with translations on Youtube).   \nThe fact that russia's initial attacks on Kyiv and Kherson in 2022 have been repulsed, and that it has not yet even succeeded in fully occupying four Ukrainian oblasts in the southeast, only shows that Russia has overestimated itself militarily and underestimated Ukraine militarily, but not that it had or still has a special interest in only these areas.   \nWhile it is true that these regions contain particularly rich mineral resources, this does not mean that russia is primarily pursuing economic interests in its war of aggression and conquest - especially since it has extensively destroyed the infrastructure - including in particular the mining and industrial facilities - in these regions, and therefore any economic exploitation would first have to be preceded by a lengthy and expensive reconstruction (including the cities, residential areas and infrastructure), which russia is neither able nor willing to afford.   \nIn this context, it should also be remembered that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, i.e. under market economy conditions, eastern Ukraine has been an economic crisis area, since the extraction of iron ore and raw materials for chemical products does not guarantee high profits in today's economy (even oil production is not particularly lucrative at present). \n\nAgainst this background, it is clear that russia and Putin were not primarily pursuing economic considerations in their efforts to conquer and subjugate Ukraine, but rather were following their well-known imperialist ideas. \n\nOf course, russia would have liked to annex Ukraine's natural resources and industrial resources (along with the population as a further resource), but geopolitical and political motives have always been and continue to be paramount. \n\nA rationally thinking and acting state would have ended this costly war long ago, which is ruining the russian economy for years to come and depleting its accumulated financial reserves – but russia isn't thinking about it.   \nFor Putin, it is primarily about winning this war in order to stay alive and to appear in the (russian) history books as a worthy descendant of Peter the Great, in other words, about power and prestige - he does not need more money or more resources (it is widely assumed that he is already the richest man in the world anyway).",

Did you not see how people responded when wagner did its coup in Rostov? That's the thing with dictators, they're all wildly popular and universally loved, until the fear bubble bursts and they they are given the gaddafi treatment. russians have to be convinced that the risk of extreme violence and death is worth it because things have gotten that bad. and we are not there yet.

This despite the fact that Sybiha (Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs) was already in Ankara, but since there's no Putin the only thing worth discussing with a low-level delegation is a ceasefire, and they won't get Ukraine's MFA either.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Putin clearly snubbed the high-level US delegation. When asked about it, Trump had this take:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1knh21n/video/gsesw2g3yz0f1/player\n\nRelatable translation:  \n\\- Jennifer do you want to go to the dance?  \n\\- No, go away  \n\\- I wasn't even planning on going to the dance. I don't even want to go to the dance. Jennifer will come around eventually.\n\nNow Rubio is echoing Trump, and says nothing can be resolved until Trump and Putin meet in person: [https://youtu.be/BsTpOFE8ciM?si=PdCDo0q\\_EZz0v7P2&amp;t=34](https://youtu.be/BsTpOFE8ciM?si=PdCDo0q_EZz0v7P2&amp;t=34) (0:34 seconds).\n\nThis is infuriating, pathetic, and a continuation of Trump undermining the united front presented just a week ago by Ukraine, European allies, and as they thought then, the US.",

        "body": "&gt;Not at all ! Just that this was the start of their problem\n\nI'd argue that the start of the problem is that Ivan III of Muscovy (the grandfather of Ivan the Terrible) led his minions to defeat the army of the Byzantine-Scandinavian Novgorod Republic at the [Battle of Shelon in 1471](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shelon).\n\nThat has turned out to be one of the world's great disasters by cementing the emergence of a transcontinental extortion racket made up of over 140 million crabs in a bucket that currently hogs 11 time zones from the Baltic to the Pacific.\n\nWith the Muscovites' victory in 1471 over its European and relatively progressive neighbor in Novgorod, they ensured that whatever would succeed the rotting corpse of the Gоldеn Ноrdе would be a despotic МоngоІеѕquе monstrosity anchored in Moscow. Muscovy's princes and their minions had climbed to the top in the preceding centuries among the Golden Horde's Slavic vassals by being the Ноrdе's most steadfast ~~collaborators~~ *bootlickers*. To put it another way, the Muscovites (i.e. direct predecessors of the \"Russians\") have been a sinister *counter*example of how \"cheaters never propser\" by systematically kissing up to the Моngоlѕ and kicking down their supposed Orthodox Slavic \"brethren\".\n\nIn short, Muscovy and then \"Russia\" is what results in a \"nation\" that was founded by collaborators or bootlickers of the occupier. It'd be like in an alternative universe where Iѕrаеl would have been founded in 1948 by [*Kapos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapo)\\* and then governed ever since only by descendants of the *Kapos*.\n\n\\**Kapos* were the guards and low-level flunkies at concentration camps drawn from the Јеwіѕh prisoners who had chosen to collaborate with the Germans.",

That’s indisputable,” Mykhailo Podolyak told Russian journalists, ruling out talks between Zelensky and Russian ministers or negotiators.\n\n“We understand how power is structured in Russia,” Podolyak said. “It’s clear that even people with formal ministerial status — or even someone like \\[Russian prime minister, Mikhail\\] Mishustin — are unlikely to be authorised to make key decisions.”\n\nZelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine would “do everything” to ensure that a summit meeting with Putin takes place in Istanbul on Thursday. He also said he would be in Turkey for talks with President Erdogan on Wednesday or Thursday. He was downbeat, however, about the prospect of a breakthrough with Russia over the war",

Zelensky just wants Putin to get the fuck out of his country and to stop slaughtering civilians. Biden should've been giving them more weapons and giving enough for Ukraine to drive those scumbags back to orcland. But at least Biden was giving weapons, trump is subservient to putin and is the most corrupt president in us history. When trump gets on his knees for Putin, it shows weakness and they see that as an invitation to attack more. They are playing with a different rulebook and If you understood how dictators operate, you'd know Putin will never stop until we get some balls and give a 24 hour window and if they're not out of Ukraine, use overwhelming air support to crush his military in occupied Ukraine. Putin fears for his life, if he cares about living, which he clearly does, he knows that we'd turn Russia into a glass parking lot and he'd be dead. It is pure sabre rattling",

He’s a physical coward and unworthy of the exertions of so many, living and dead, who actually ended Axis tyranny, and those who have preserved the peace in the decades since. \n\nThe idea that VE Day was also somehow the end of the story intentionally and arrogantly ignores the unfinished fight in the Pacific that Stalin only joined when convenient. Stalin’s entry was marked principally by extending his special brand of tyranny into Korea and China, and the theft of American arms as it and its fellow Western Allies did the heavy lifting during the USSR’s “neutrality.”\n\nThe World must end Putin’s ignorant, white-washed version of WWII and speak of it as it was, not how he would have it be. It’s fundamentally not a story made from shambolic narratives of “strength” or “manhood” that must be restored by latter day charlatans claiming insight into either. The story of victory and peace is that of ordinary people, asked to do extraordinary things, for a just and better World. It took courage, cleverness, and above all vision and wisdom for something better in its terrible aftermath. We are all heirs of it, and capable of the same if we challenge ourselves in body, mind, and spirit.\n\nMy forbearers who passed those lessons on to me were simple people and never claimed otherwise. They never saw themselves as special heroes. They did their duty with dignity and magnanimity. Their faith was the lesson I clung to facing my time in combat. I did my duty, no more, no less.

We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire — complete, lasting and reliable — starting tomorrow, May 12, and Ukraine is ready to meet.”\n\nAndriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, said on Telegram that first there had to be a ceasefire, “then everything else”.\n\nHowever, Putin has so far refused to bow to pressure from the US, UK and Europe to accept a 30-day ceasefire. During his latest comments, he suggested holding a new round of negotiations on May 15 in Istanbul but added there would be no preconditions on Russia’s part",

The best way to have solved this war would have to put the fear of MAD into Putin, by announcing that Russia must withdraw or Ukraine will be made a full member of NATO and then mobilizing. The Cuban missile crisis demonstrates that MAD is only effective if the threat is credible. Putin's view is that the West will do anything to avoid this outcome, so he's been in the drivers seat. When we called his bluff with weapons, tanks, planes and long range missiles, the West should have doubled down, to ensure Ukraine to push the Russians out. Even these threats of sanctions are three years too damn late. They need Russia to fear the West. Until they do, they will continue to push the envelope.",

Lets be real - if one works from POV that since this is  the second phase of invasion started in 2014, that Putler and his cockpuppet still stand on the position that Ukraine gets \"concession\" as not being annexed in full, and  given that the propaganda inside Russia continues to massage people into the thought of invading further countries such as Baltic states, Poland and Moldova - if we work from the POV that Ukrainian resistance  and ability to fight back is the one time we get to beat the idea of conquest from Russia for another generation (as they do seem to get invade-y this often)...  Then phrasing this as \"accept ceasefire or we'll send more weapons\" is not even aimed at Putler.\n\nIt's aimed at disarming the Agent Orange propaganda about how Russia is poor and misunderstood actor in this and not an expansionistic colonizer on a war of conquest and genocide.\n\nPS.: as a complete sidenote, I think this is also very interesting for us dilletantes on the sidelines. Situation on eastern front has been dire for months, and neither side is in any massive push right now. And there's a general rule to serious warfare, the kind where you fight for higher stakes than just ground and minerals. You do not want to be discussing peace when you're on the back foot. There's alweys back and forth in any fight, and you'd get most concessions right after/during succeful push. So if Russians believed they were winning this war in strategic terms as in why they invaded in the first place - they would benefit more than Ukraine from accepting a cease fire and entrenching and resupplying.  \nAgain, I'm a dilletante - but I think it's important aspect to consider. This isn't *just* about showing Putler the peace dove is a lie, it calls his bluff on what tbh I had assumed for recent months - that Ukraine is more on back foot currently than Russia. If Russia believed they were stronger now, a short term defined cease-fire benefits them more than it does Ukraine.",

So his take on Russian lying was: **“We lie out of necessity. We lie when it’s convenient. And we lie just to keep in shape.”**\n\n&gt;I am by no means saying that all Russians are liars, but I think it's safe to say that most Russians are familiar with the concept of *vranyo*. A discipline they know as a cross between sports and the arts. The Potiomkin villages is just one of the incarnations of *vranyo –* one of the older and more harmless ones – with a centuries old history. There are tons of other examples from more recent times, of course.\n\n&gt;Let’s not forget that Russian leaders are not just serial liars, but serial invaders, too. Vladimir Putin and his generation of Russian leaders have grown up with the understanding and experience that Russia has the right to invade other countries when it serves Moscow’s interests. It’s legitimate and not a violation of international law. Just a quick look at history will show the Soviet invasion of the Baltic states in 1940, and then after the end of WW II: the invasion of Eastern Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968, Afghanistan 1979, Georgia 2008, and Ukraine 2014.\n\nAs we've seen over at least the last three years, practically nothing gives more satisfaction to a Russian than to \"win\", or more accurately, to **dominate** someone else. In the Russians' default world-view of life being just a zero-sum game, a Russian victory must always mean defeat for a non-Russian. The converse is that a non-Russian's victory must always mean a defeat for a Russian even when the whole affair has nothing to do with the Russians (cf. \"Offended by everything, ashamed of nothing. Thy name is Russian\"),\n\n\"Win-win\" or a resolution that's truly mutually beneficial is ultimately unacceptable or unsustainable to the Russian because it cannot be that the Russian is not \"first among equals\" or does not come out clearly ahead of everyone else",

It would basically eliminate any last hope of them getting more territory in Ukraine. Today, Russia still has the delusion that they will get all of the oblasts they \"annexed.\" With a ceasefire they'd have to give that up.\n\nThe Coalition must know this. So they're making a very reasonable demand that they know will be rejected. This isn't an attempt at peace or ceasefire - it's one move in a psychological and strategic chess game. And they think it's a move that's good for Ukraine.\n\nPerhaps - just maybe - Russia's rejection or violation of the ceasefire will reduce the zone of ambiguity, drawing a bright line between those who support Russia and those who oppose Russia. Optimistically (and optimism may be warranted - these are very competent people with good goals), they may be working to make it reasonable to sideline European countries that support Russia.",

Ukrainian leadership claimed that they shot down another Russian plane at practically the same time, in the same way. This is the first time in history an unmanned vehicle has shot down a fighter jet. The fact that they apparently destroyed two means they must have really caught the Russians with their pants down. \n\n**Maps:** \n\nSumy last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luso94n1fkze1.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3b14bc8886c566fa34578530dcd00e6887635b\n\nSumy this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41y69vx2fkze1.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c38eb3125c4e62b3eef9cc2f3eb55b1227b208\n\n* No advances by Russian forces here this week. I've seen some reports that Ukrainians made another advance into Kursk here, but it's not on the map, so isn't confirmed. \n\nKupiansk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6087fdbcfkze1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38af01c199f11a203b89f6da0b0c30bdb55fca7\n\nKupiansk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vhdh8ksdfkze1.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97367bde91089da423483739df8ba045731186c9\n\n* No changes here. \n\nLyman last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhuno2ogfkze1.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d421f31c7a7d00328fe3b41d201a161ae29cb43\n\nLyman this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y195j49ifkze1.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be383d0f4c42f028102f537338f7987c906f2f66\n\n* Russian forces made very small advances north of Siversk and northeast of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5gopgisfkze1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95c29b437d3540ed8aba70f22660ebd2919752a\n\nChasiv Yar this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o203r73ufkze1.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d94465c9232ce2aa9cffaafeba6cd9e4f260f0c\n\n* Russia took a reasonably substantial chunk of territory north of Chasiv Yar this week. Remember that this screenshot is more zoomed in than the others, so this looks bigger than it is. Still, it's the first change we've seen here in a while. Fortunately the advance was not actually within the city, so it's unclear if this represents any kind of real change in the status quo here. \n\nPokrovsk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keqfv4r5gkze1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d305c56aecb792552952b69ef098e12127713a7\n\nPokrovsk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s62sns07gkze1.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14cb26e4d6be12e0f2b7a7f805dc2214a345645a\n\n* Russia advanced southwest of Pokrovsk and also made a major breakthrough of Ukrainian lines between Pokrovsk and Toretsk. This is the first breakthrough we've seen here in a while. Strong Ukrainian units have been sent to contain the advance, but if it gets much further it could seriously imperil the fight for Toretsk. Russia has been pushing very hard here for quite some time, so it's not unexpected that they would finally see some success, but still, it's not good that this happened. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbnkk1ppgkze1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a13888d76b80aa7368430c8db89b892c9f70582\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gve9gr5rgkze1.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658ab3189f85faf22a01729a97f24677f8cabeef\n\n* Russia took a chunk of territory west of Velyka Novosilka, no changes here besides that. \n\n**Events this week:** \n\n* A wave of hundreds of Ukrainian drones hit targets all over Russia yesterday, shutting down the Moscow airport right before the Russian Victory Day parade, which is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Military airfields near Moscow were also hit, as were key industrial sites including the biggest producer of fiber optic cable in Russia, which sustained a direct hit and major damage. Drones using fiber optic cables have become crucially important all over the front, so hitting the factory that produces the cables is very clever. \n* Russia responded with their own wave of drone and missile strikes against Ukraine, killing civilians in several different places. Ukrainian air defense is being stretched to the limit at the moment, though they are set to receive more Patriot batteries soon, and hopefully enough interceptor missiles to allow them to engage more targets. \n* Probably due to fear of Ukrainian strikes at the parade itself, several world leaders who were set to attend have dropped out, including the president of Azerbaijan, which has fairly close ties with Russia. \n* The Trump administration has shown even more frustration with Putin and Russia, with Trump saying Putin wants \"all of Ukraine,\" and JD Vance saying that \"the Russians are demanding too much.\" Russia did have a real chance to play the Trump administration and get a relatively favorable peace deal out of them, but they are too rigid and beholden to their maximalist war goals to take advantage of that opportunity, and now I do think they've missed their chance. \n* Reuters is also reporting that the cut off of US aid to Ukraine that happened after the Oval Office fight between Trump and Zelensky was not ordered by Trump. Apparently Defense Secretary and known idiot Pete Hegseth ordered it on his own, before being overruled a week later. Hegseth has got to go, and this is just the latest reason why. \n* Staunchly pro-Ukraine German leader Friedrick Merz was officially inaugurated as Chancellor, after unexpectedly losing the first vote. He is keeping on Boris Pistorious as defense minister, who is one of the biggest champions of Ukraine in Europe. I expect that German military support for Ukraine will grow dramatically in the next year.\n* Czech leader and extremely strong Ukraine supporter Petr Pavel announced that the Czech initiative to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine has grown even further, with potentially up to 1.8 million total shells being delivered by the end of this year, an increase of 300,000 over what was planned before. This initiative has been hugely successful and is one of the biggest reasons why Ukrainian artillery has been much closer to parity with the Russians so far this year.  \n* French news reported that the production of the highly capable AASM Hammer precision guided bombs has reached 1,200 per year, with every single one of those bombs due to be supplied to Ukraine. The Hammer has a very good inertial guidance system that allows it to still be accurate even in an environment with lots of jamming and EW. It's been a huge help for Ukraine, and the fact that France is rapidly scaling up production and sending all of them to Ukraine is really good. \n* Global economic pressure has led to falling oil prices, which will impact Russia very negatively. The price that Russian oil is selling at is already 40% below the target their budget set, and OPEC + is close to allowing members to further increase production, which would of course send oil prices even lower.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,648 (+98)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,970 (+23)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,800 (+16)\n* Russian SPG losses: 928 (+5)\n* Russian SAM losses: 323 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 140 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,805 (+54)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,167 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,353 (+3)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 902 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 542 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nReasonably light losses on both sides this week. It is pretty unusual, however, to see more tanks lost than IFVs on both sides. I've also noticed that Ukrainian SPG losses have been fairly high the past few months, though that could be in part because they are now producing many Bohdana SPGs domestically, meaning they don't have to be quite as careful with them. \n\nAs usual, thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them!",

It organizes logistics, contracts suppliers, and circumvents sanctions to secure foreign parts.\n\nLed by CEO Mikhail Kolesnikov, who was detained for embezzlement but continues to facilitate defense contracts. The company is linked to Putin’s associates, including Boris Obnosov and his daughter Olga Zorikova, who owns stakes in related firms.\n\nUral Design Bureau “Dietal”:\nManufactures altimeters for X-101 missiles, relying on TRV-Engineering to supply microchips and other components. Dietal’s orders (e.g., state contract #2225187923201412208226001) drive production planning.\n\nTactical Missiles Corporation (KTRV):\nA major Russian defense contractor, 100% owned by the Federal Agency for State Property Management. It oversees X-101 production and is managed by Boris Obnosov (Director General) and Boris Gryzlov (Chairman), both close Putin allies.\n\nJSC State Machine Building Design Bureau “Raduga”:\nThe primary manufacturer of X-101 missiles, dependent on Dietal’s altimeters and TRV-Engineering’s supply chain.\n\nForeign Actors:\nIntegral OJSC (Belarus):\nA Minsk-based company supplying microchips for X-101 altimeters, as documented in TRV-Engineering’s orders. Its involvement makes Belarus complicit in Russia’s missile production and a potential military target for Ukraine.\n\nChinese Suppliers:\nUnnamed Chinese companies provide components, such as servo drives for guided bombs and substitutes for Kazakh tantalum products used in capacitors, through sophisticated schemes to conceal their role in the supply chain.\n\nKazakh Suppliers:\nSupply tantalum products for capacitors used in missile electronics, though payment issues have prompted Russia to seek Chinese alternatives.\n\nIndividuals Linked to Putin’s Inner Circle:\nBoris Obnosov: KTRV Director General, a former UN mission member and Putin confidant, whose company Teploservis and daughter Olga Zorikova hold stakes in TRV-Engineering’s parent company, Zvezda-Strela.\n\nOlga Zorikova: Obnosov’s daughter, a makeup artist owning 50% of Teploservis, indirectly linked to TRV-Engineering’s procurement activities.\n\nBoris Gryzlov: Chairman of KTRV’s board, a prominent Russian politician, Putin ally, and ambassador to Belarus, deeply involved in Russia’s defense industry.\n\nMikhail Kolesnikov: TRV-Engineering CEO, implicated in sanctions evasion and missile part procurement, despite his detention for embezzlement.\n\nConclusions\nRussia sustains X-101 missile production by procuring altimeter components through TRV-Engineering, which navigates sanctions by smuggling foreign parts (notably Belarusian microchips from Integral OJSC) and using Chinese and Kazakh suppliers.\n\nThe supply chain’s reliance on foreign components, despite near-localized altimeter production, creates vulnerabilities, such as payment disputes or potential Ukrainian strikes on suppliers like Dietal or Raduga.\n\nKey actors, including TRV-Engineering, KTRV, and Putin’s associates (Obnosov, Gryzlov, Zorikova, Kolesnikov), are central to sanctions evasion, making them complicit in war crimes and potential targets for accountability measures.\n\nDisrupting this supply chain through targeted sanctions or attacks on critical nodes (e.g., Integral OJSC, Dietal) could significantly weaken Russia’s missile production capacity.",

Altimeters are critical components of the missile’s control unit.\n\nWhile Russia has localized much of the altimeter production, it still depends on foreign microchips for key components. These parts are documented in TRV-Engineering’s procurement records and Integral’s product catalog.\n\nSanctions Evasion and Procurement Networks:\nDespite Western sanctions, Russia procures foreign parts, including altimeter components, through TRV-Engineering, which organizes supplies for the Ural Design Bureau “Dietal”, the altimeter manufacturer for X-101 missiles.\n\nThe article notes that Russia has found ways to smuggle foreign-made parts and pass off illegally imported Western components as domestic products, enabling near-localized altimeter production. However, specific Western microcircuits (e.g., from the U.S. and Japan) are still used, with identification labels often erased to obscure their origin.\n\nProcurement challenges include payment issues with suppliers (e.g., Kazakh suppliers of tantalum for capacitors) and reliance on Chinese components as alternatives, indicating vulnerabilities in the supply chain.\n\nProduction Scale and Planning:\nRussia plans to produce 633 X-101 missiles in 2025, based on TRV-Engineering’s orders for altimeter parts to Dietal. Each altimeter requires specific microchips, with delivery schedules (e.g., 100 altimeters between December 2024 and January 2025, 50 by March 2026) reflecting a two-year production strategy.\n\nThe supply chain is sensitive to disruptions, such as drone attacks (e.g., on NPO Strela) or supplier refusals, which can delay component deliveries and affect missile production.",

He cited a bill that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is putting together that would impose stringent new sanctions on Russia and tariffs on countries that purchase Russian energy.\n\nHe also expressed concerns about Hungary’s Viktor Orbán potentially vetoing the next European Union renewal of Russia sanctions, suggesting that Trump could put pressure on Orbán to prevent him from doing so.\n\n“Putin understands only the strong position, only the pressure,” Tsahkna said. While he didn’t fault Trump for engaging with Russia, Tsahkna said it’s clear that Putin is “playing with” the US and Europe.\n\n[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/05/06/2025/time-to-push-putin-to-the-corner-estonian-foreign-minister-says?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)",

That's what happened to the USSR--the incompetent post-purge Red Army of 1940-1941 gave way to the Red Army that stormed Berlin in 1945. And we saw similar in Afghanistan--though we can meme about their incompetence in general, they *were* learning what worked and what didn't. And we've seen the same now--the exposed columns of the first attempt on Kyiv, tanks abandoned in fields, Bayrakters striking with impunity, that doesn't happen nearly as much these days. And, of course, they've learned how to fortify. The longer-duration conflict has also given Putin the chance to crack down on what was *left* of dissent in the ranks--while I'd say Boris Nemtsov was the last actually decent opposition figure, Navalny or Girkin or Prigozhin could still have raised some hell. Not anymore. And, of course, it's taught Putin (and other tyrants) that they can, push comes to shove, last for *years* under Western sanctions. \n\nAs for \"money to be made,\" Ukraine would be contributing a lot more to the US/EU economy at this point if the Moskals had been expelled in 2023 and the country could focus on rebuilding and pivoting to Europe. \n\nWhile I'm sure there *are* morons in the US State Department who believe the \"prolonged war = thorough dismantling and more profit\" meme, it doesn't have any basis in reality. It's the kind of pseudo-economics that would appeal to the geniuses who think nuking a neutral third party in response to Moscow nuking Germany is better than nuking Moscow itself (actual US policy during a war game under Obama!), but it's still dumb.",

While Russia has adapted to stretch their funds out, they're in a terrible position atm and will probably continue to be for decades to come. Their soviet stock is actually depleting and while their army is adapting it's a stretch to say they're weeding out less-competent officers. \n\nThey're not becoming more competent on the whole. The ratio's of Russian deaths against Ukrainian deaths have gotten worse over the course of the war. While they still have a lot of equipment, they've been supplementing with North-Korean equipment because their artillery started to run out. They've used all sorts of vehicles to get their troops in a position to get slaughtered.\n\nThe main thing they did is indeed fortify, after Ukraine started collapsing their lines and they're pretty good at that. They employ drones and EW and are trying to keep up with Ukraine on the technological front. I'll give them that.\n\nIn the whole it does look bad for them.

He is an authoritarian dictator, but he maintains a symbiotic mutually beneficial dynamic with the other oligarchs and others with leadership ambitions like Medvedev who all are capable of challenging his authority. Prigozhin was one of said oligarchs who Putin didn't appease and it demonstrated a MASSIVE risk to his authority and threatened him. These Oligarchs have private armies and Mafioso up the wazoo. \n\nThey are all Russian nationalists who support the war and they all are capable of threatening and challenging Putin, especially if they rebel together. They're also capable of taking control of Putin dies. His existence owes to their mercy as a mediator of their interests and rivalry. If he stops serving their interests they will kill him and take his place, resuming business as normal. \n\nRussia needs to undergo a fundamental people's revolution against the Oligarchs but it won't do that because Russian Nationalism is a fundamental core aspect of the people's culture in itself and Putin appeases further by rallying imperial fervour by invading neighbours and appealing to a sense of the good ol days of the Soviet Union, which was Russia just pillaging every other member for their own people. Which means at this point that brings the final option and the only one that will stop this problem in future - a fundamental cultural change forced upon Russians at gunpoint by a benevolent invader, as the Allies did to Germany post WW2 in order to Denazify the state.",

For more than 30 years, she worked in intelligence, served in the US Navy, held various positions in the military, civil service and industry, according to her biography.\n\nFor the past six years, Julianne Gloss has been making a career at the US Central Intelligence Agency. In February 2024, she was appointed deputy director of the CIA for digital innovation. “I am committed to accelerating the digital transformation of my agency to maintain a strategic advantage for our nation,” she writes on the business social network Linkedin.\n\nIn 2023, Michael Gloss decided to become a hippie traveler, dropped out of school, and set off on a world tour. He posted photos on social media with the hashtag #endukrainewar, joined the anti-war hippie movement Rainbow Family, went to an eco-activist camp, and raked up rubble after earthquakes in Turkey.\n\nAs an acquaintance of Gloss recalls, over time, Michael began calling himself Hamza, became a supporter of Palestine, started watching conspiracy videos, and talked about the ideas of a “multipolar world” and war against “Western hegemony.”\n\nIn Istanbul, Gloss got a Russian visa and set off on another journey: from southern Russia to Moscow. Along the way, he acquired a Soviet flag, created a VK account, subscribed to groups about Lenin, Stalin, and communism, and posted videos with Putin.\n\nLater, he was recruited by the Russians. He created a page in Odnoklassniki, published videos from the location of the 137th Airborne Regiment (military unit 41450), which is in Ryazan.\n\nGloss left for the Donetsk region around December 2023. It is known that units of the 137th Regiment were located northwest of Soledar.\n\nIt is known that Gloss last logged into Telegram on March 14, 2024, and two weeks later the 137th Airborne Regiment launched an offensive against Ukrainian positions.\n\nMichael died on April 4, 2024, his family reported in an obituary. On the same day, according to the Telegram channel of the 106th Division, which includes the Ryazan Regiment, the paratroopers continued their offensive in the Donetsk region near Rozdolivka and Vesely, “despite the difficult terrain and unfavorable positions,” reports “Important Stories.”\n\n“They enter the enemy’s rear in small assault groups, transmit the coordinates of the artillery and cover the Ukrainian fascists. Then they clear the fortifications,” the Russian military wrote about those events at the front.\n\nThe exact circumstances of Michael’s death are unknown.\n\nHis funeral in the United States took place on December 21, 2024, eight months after his death.\n\nIt is likely that his family learned of his death two months before the funeral.\n\n“His family was contacted by Russian authorities. They were told that he died on the territory of Ukraine. We do not know if he participated in the war. They did not provide detailed information,” wrote Michael’s friend, who spoke with his sister.\n\nThe obituary does not say that Michael fought against Ukraine on the side of the Russian army, but only this: “With his noble heart and warrior spirit, Michael was forging his own path as a hero when he tragically died in Eastern Europe on April 4, 2024.”",

They added that details of the plans had yet to be completed and could still change.\n\nAn administration official said Witkoff’s outreach to Putin is part of Trump’s efforts to make peace, move beyond past failed strategies and end the deadly conflict.

Overnight, Russia launched the biggest airstrike of the year against Ukraine, targeting Kyiv and killing at least 12 people.\n\nThat forced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to cut short a visit to South Africa on Thursday. Before he left, Zelenskiy told reporters that “we can’t talk about red lines without an unconditional ceasefire.”\n\nAt a meeting in Paris last week, Trump’s team presented Europe and Ukraine with a proposal to end the war that would also see the US recognize Ukraine’s Crimea region as Russian while freezing most other occupied territories along current battle lines, effectively leaving them under Moscow’s control, Bloomberg News previously reported.\n\n\nCrimea was taken by the Kremlin in 2014 following an invasion and subsequent referendum held under occupation, and the international community has resisted recognizing the peninsula as Russian to avoid legitimizing the illegal annexation. Zelenskiy has repeatedly said he won’t cede territory to Moscow. \n\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social this week that nobody was asking Zelenskiy to recognize Crimea, and he lashed out at the Ukrainian president, accusing him of undermining peace negotiations.\n\n“I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskiy. I hope that Zelenskiy — I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskiy. So far, it’s been harder,” Trump said on Wednesday in the Oval Office.\n\nThen on Thursday, Trump criticized Putin for the latest round of attacks on Ukraine.\n\n“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday. “Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!”",

Some ground was retaken directly south of Pokrovsk, and also within Toretsk. The battle for Toretsk has been a horrific meat grinder for the Russians, and the fact that the fight for the city continues, and they don't even seem to have much of an upper hand, is a bad sign for them. There were also reports this week that Russian forces tried a massive motorcycle attack against Ukrainian positions near Pokrovsk, which was completely destroyed by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed almost 100 motorcycles, 21 armored vehicles, and dozens of Russian soldiers. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7mp1rrypswe1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6815c4821a5a7737e21040352ea9c92a300310d1\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8vh9rh0qswe1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a0241559f71dec862201c2042fdddb97270b1b\n\n* No changes here. \n\n**Peace Deal Analysis:**\n\n* The terms of the deal set out by the US between Ukraine and Russia are as follows:\n   * Official recognition of Crimea as Russian.\n   * No NATO membership for Ukraine, though EU membership is accepted.\n   * Freezing the conflict along current front lines, with some minor territory transfers (Ukraine getting some territory in Kharkiv, and Russia getting some territory in Donetsk), importantly, this would be a de facto recognition, not an official (de jure) one.\n   * Sanctions lifted on Russia.\n   * Some kind of economic cooperation agreement between Russia and the US.\n   * A \"robust\" security guarantee for Ukraine, provided by European nations, though the exact terms of this are vague. \n   * Unimpeded passage on the Dnipro river for Ukrainian ships.\n   * Compensation and assistance for rebuilding Ukraine, though the terms of this are also vague.\n   * The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be considered to be on Ukrainian territory, but will be operated by the US, with power supplied to Ukraine and Russia.\n* Overall, this deal is reasonably close to what I was expecting. You can look at comments I made over a year ago about the eventual resolution of the war where I sketched out something very similar to this. It favors Russia more than Ukraine, but the inclusion of EU membership, no demilitarization of Ukraine, and real security guarantees are all significant elements that don't leave Ukraine out to dry too much. \n* A lot depends on what exactly the security guarantees are. European peacekeeping contingents and a continued flow of arms to Ukraine are crucial to preserve any peace. I've seen some reports that this deal precludes any European peacekeeping forces, but I haven't seen direct confirmation of that. If it does, then it should be totally rejected. \n* It's important to remember that the chief Russian goals of the invasion were to eliminate Ukrainian sovereignty and \"de-militarize\" the country. Any deal that leaves Ukraine with control over its own government and preserves the strength of the Ukrainian military, is, in a way, a colossal loss for Russia, even though it may not feel that way, since Ukraine would still have to cede territory to Russia in response to an illegal invasion. For these reasons I also think it's unlikely that Russia will accept the deal, since accepting it would mean a tacit acknowledgement that they failed in their explicitly stated goals for the war.  \n* I also think it's unlikely Ukraine will accept the deal, since they have written into their constitution that they can't cede any territory to Russia. \n* This is a great example of the problem of justice vs. peace, similar in some ways to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Ukraine wants justice, while the US wants peace. You can certainly make the case that peace without justice is wrong. But if you look at how that policy has worked out for the Palestinians, you get the sense that at some point, sacrificing your people for the sake of land is also wrong. There aren't any good options here unfortunately, and in some ways, this kind of deal represents one of the least bad options. To keep fighting the war for another couple of years, Ukraine will certainly have to further lower their age of conscription. They already have a huge demographic problem and comparatively very few young people, so having to send those 18- and 19-year-olds to the front line would really hurt the country's prospects going forward. I do think it would be worth it to sacrifice Donetsk and Luhansk to save those young people, though that is obviously an extraordinarily bitter pill to swallow. \n* The bottom line for me is, when you are fighting against someone much stronger than you, you have to accept that survival is the most important victory. This deal, if it did include peacekeeping forces, would allow Ukraine to survive. I'd love to be in a world where Ukraine is able to take back the territory they've lost. But unfortunately, we haven't seen any indication that they are capable of that. And waiting on the Russian military to collapse is not a winning bet. Ask Napoleon or Hitler how that worked out for them. \n\n**Events this Week:** \n\n* In a grim continuation of a recent trend, Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike against Ukraine, including attacks that explicitly targeted civilians, which is a war crime. At least 9 people were killed, and many more wounded. This attack did prompt Trump to angrily post on social media \"Vladimir, STOP!\" He has publicly expressed his frustration with Putin more than once, and a part of me still holds out for the day when he may finally realize that trying to work with Putin is a fool's errand. But he and JD Vance also posted more false and incredibly stupid criticisms of Zelensky and said that if the proposed deal isn't agreed to soon, the US will fully step away from the conflict. \n* A massive explosion occurred at Russia's 51st GRAU arsenal close to Moscow. It's unclear if the explosion was because of a Ukrainian attack, sabotage, or simply a mistake. But the damage and fires are clearly visible on satellite imagery, so this was a very powerful explosion. Some sources have claimed that over 100,000 tons of ammunition were destroyed.\n* Putin announced a farce Easter truce last weekend that was immediately violated hundreds of times by his own forces. \n* Reuters reported this week that small groups of officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army have arrived in Ukraine behind Russian lines to observe conditions and gather information. These officers are not fighting in the war but are there to signal Chinese support for Russia and help the Chinese military learn lessons from the war. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,470 (+145)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,938 (+21)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,874 (+58)\n* Russian SPG losses: 918 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 320 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 139 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,678 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,156 (+5)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,326 (+11)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 886 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 529 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+1)\n\nLighter losses on both sides this week, though Russia losses are still fairly bad. Ukrainian ones are mostly back to normal.\n\nThanks for reading! ",

        "body": "# Why Ukraine would rather fight than give Crimea to Russia\n\nAs Trump pressurises Zelensky to recognise Moscow’s control over the peninsula, Kyiv fears this would set a dangerous precedent and further embolden Putin. *Marc Bennetts, Kyiv, Thursday April 24 2025, 12.35pm BST, The Times*\n\nFor President Trump, the solution to the war in Ukraine is extremely simple: Kyiv should recognise the realities on the ground and put aside its objections to the Kremlin’s land grabs. For many Ukrainians, though, Trump’s demands are not only unrealistic but a threat to the very existence of their country. As he pushes hard for a peace deal before his 100th day in office, Trump has taken a sledgehammer approach to diplomacy, threatening to walk away entirely from negotiations and attacking President Zelensky’s refusal to acknowledge Russian rule in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that was annexed in 2014.\n\n“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelensky’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. He said that Crimea had been “lost years ago” and that its status was “not even a point of discussion”.\n\nFor Kyiv, the recognition of Russia’s seizure of Crimea would set a “dangerous precedent” and only encourage President Putin’s appetite for Ukrainian lands, according to Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst who is seen as close to Zelensky’s administration. Although Trump’s peace proposal has not been published by the White House, a draft copy that was seen by Axios, an American media outlet, says that it would involve Washington formally recognising Russian control over Crimea and acknowledging its de facto rule in four regions in the east and south of Ukraine. Fesenko said: “If we have to choose between recognising Crimea as Russian and the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process, then Ukraine is more likely to be prepared for the US to pull out of the talks. For Ukraine, this is the lesser of two evils.\n\n“Of course, these are potential risks for Ukraine in this. But we must understand that the risk of recognising \\[Russian control of\\] Crimea is much greater and more long-term than the risk of the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process. Crimea is a very serious and very fundamental issue for us. If the Americans agree to this, then after some time Putin will almost inevitably demand recognition of the rest of the annexed territories.”\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump said that Zelensky was not being asked to recognise Crimea as Russian territory. However, he suggested that he expected some kind of commitment from Zelensky that Ukraine would no longer challenge the Kremlin’s rule over the peninsula, a stunningly beautiful region where Soviet leaders once took their holidays. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” Trump wrote. He also appeared to repeat one of Putin’s justifications for seizing Crimea, writing that it had been home to Russian submarine bases “for many years”.\n\nPutin has said that Russia was forced to seize Crimea to prevent Sevastopol, the home of its Black Sea fleet, from falling under Nato’s control after a pro-western government came to power in Kyiv in 2014.",

Trump’s abrupt reversal of the Biden administration’s support for Kyiv in favour of improving ties with Russia has already made him deeply unpopular in Ukraine. His efforts to pressure Zelensky on Crimea have now provoked open contempt.\n\nIllia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist, wrote on X: “This insane plan to blackmail and twist Ukraine’s arm — a scheme as foolish as it is detached from reality — will go down as one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of global diplomacy.” But not everyone is ready to write off Trump and his administration just yet. “Of course we are not going to give up on the United States, because the situation can change,” Merezhko said. “We need to work with Trump. Who knows, maybe he will come to his senses at some point.”",

        "body": "### Zelensky accuses Trump’s envoy of ‘spreading Russian narratives’\nTamila Tasheva, an MP who was Zelensky’s permanent representative for Crimea until last year, warned that “trading territory for a ceasefire” would not bring a lasting peace. “On the contrary, it could serve as a foundation for renewed aggression,” she said. “A precedent of conceding land to an aggressor would have far-reaching consequences for both regional and global security. The past 11 years of the occupation [of Crimea] have shown that partial concessions do not lead to de-escalation. Russia does not interpret them as compromise but rather as weakness.”\n\nFesenko said, however, that Trump’s threats and pressure on Ukraine could be part of a “psychological attack” by the White House aimed at extracting massive concessions from Kyiv in the shortest possible time. “So we have to wait it out, and hold out until Trump’s mood changes,” he said.\nAlthough Zelensky has admitted that Ukraine is not at present strong enough to liberate Crimea and other Russian-occupied territories by force, he has said that Kyiv will strive to return them through diplomatic efforts. He has also said that Ukraine will discuss wider issues on how on resolve the war only after a full ceasefire has come into effect across the 600-mile front, a proposal that Moscow has not agreed to.\n\nCrimea has held strategic importance in Europe for millennia. At the time of the ancient Greeks it was a boundary between the classical world and the untamed steppe. The Crimean Khanate, a Tatar successor state of the Golden Horde, was the primary power in the region for hundreds of years until Catherine the Great’s Russian Empire won the territory in a war with the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century.\n\nRussia’s ambitions in the wider region met opposition from other big powers, including Britain, in an episode that culminated the in the Crimean War in the 1850s. During the Soviet period, Crimean Tatars were oppressed and deported to central Asia under Stalin, and Crimea was the setting of the Yalta talks that sought to reorder Europe after the Second World War. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the peninsula from the Russian Soviet Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1954. It is recognised as a part of Ukraine by a large majority of nations to this day.\nEven if Ukraine wanted to hand over Crimea to Russia, though, there would be significant legal obstacles. According to the Ukrainian constitution, Crimea is an inseparable part of Ukraine and the government has no legal right to sign it away without a two-thirds majority vote in parliament and the approval of the Ukrainian people in a referendum. Another complication is that neither referendums nor elections can be held under martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in 2022.\n\n“Ukraine will always act in accordance with its constitution,” Zelensky wrote, in an apparent response to Trump’s comments. He also posted on social media a “Crimea declaration” from 2018 by Mike Pompeo, then Trump’s secretary of state, which said Washington “rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea”. Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP who heads the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it was possible that Trump was putting forward “absurd” demands as a deliberate negotiating tactic and that he would lower them if Kyiv held firm. “This is the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic scenario is that [Trump] understands that Ukraine will never agree to recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea as legal and this is all a pretext to walk away from negotiations and to blame Ukraine instead of Russia.”\n\nAlthough the White House peace plan is reported to say that Ukraine would get “a robust security guarantee” from its allies in Europe and elsewhere, there were no details on how a peacekeeping operation would function and no mention of any direct involvement by the United States. It also ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. “We need security guarantees, because without them this is a just a delayed death for us,” Merezhko said. “We need a guarantee of our survival.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, Ukraine has been reluctant even to discuss the plan, under which sanctions of Russia would also be lifted. In return, aside from the vague security guarantees, Kyiv would get back a small part of land that Russia has occupied in the Kharkiv region, unimpeded passage of the Dnipro river — especially in the Kherson region, where Russian forces are on the riverbank — and promises of compensation and assistance to rebuild.",

This policy of non-recognition lasted for five decades and played a crucial role in enabling the Baltic states to maintain their diplomatic missions and financial assets during Soviet occupation. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the declaration's legacy helped the Baltic states re-establish their independence and gain international recognition.\n\n&gt;In the context of Crimea, the Welles Declaration serves as a historical precedent for the principle of non-recognition of territorial changes achieved through force. It underscores the importance of maintaining international norms and could influence negotiations regarding Crimea's status by highlighting the long-term impact of such policies on territorial disputes and sovereignty.\n\nIf you disregard the monumental stupidity of ceding territory for what constitutes to a pinky swear for russia to end their aggression on this condition alone, it really is a very dangerous precedent to set for any future territorial wars, global peace, the rules based order and international laws.\n\nAnd it is quite obvious to anyone who knows putins goals, has any understanding of russian ambitions and history, that this will only strengthen russia so they can restart a bigger war in a few years.

It's about ego more than money. It's about beating or crushing his opponent. And equally: he is a junkie. That would explain why he loses interest soon after a deal is made - mineral deal with Afghanistan for example - AND why he breaks deals to remake them bigger and 'better' - Canada Mexico for example. As soon as his high wears off, he needs another hit. It is never enough to satisfy. And the more dominant alpha/crushing that he can be - the better his fix but then he will always need an even bigger hit. \n\nMoney? It's not as important. If it were, he probably wouldn't have gone bankrupt as often as he has. And he wouldn't lose interest so quickly after a deal is made. He very often fails with any follow through that is required for making money from his deals - even when a lot of money could be made. The Afghanistan mineral deal is a great example of this. Very soon after striking that deal, he threw the Afghans under the bus - completely sidelined them and made a deal with the Taliban... and we all know what was the result of that.\n\nAnd of course that means he is the absolute worst type of person to make a deal with because he will never fill his cravings and he will always want to redo the deal in even more domineering ways (UA mineral deal for example - as soon as UA was on the verge of agreeing he massively upped his demands - he just wasn't getting enough of his drug). It seems to me that this is the perfect addiction for a narcissist. \n\nI imagine that not being able to make deals absolutely enrages him beyond any reason, too.  \n\nThat's my latest read on trump anyway for what it is worth.",

    "selftext": "There seems to be a notable pattern where major Ukrainian battlefield successes—such as the destruction of the large ammunition depot in Russia’s Vladimir region—are quickly followed by renewed pressure from Donald Trump and his team for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and an unfavorable peace deal.\n\n# Timeline and Coincidence\n\n* On April 22, 2025, a huge explosion destroyed one of Russia’s largest munitions depots near Moscow, causing a significant loss of ammunition and likely further straining Russia’s already stretched logistics[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html).\n* Almost immediately, U.S. officials, including Trump’s envoy, convened with Ukrainian and European representatives in London to push Trump’s “final offer” peace proposal, which would require Ukraine to accept U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian occupation in several other regions[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html)[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Nature of the Peace Proposal\n\n* The proposal is widely seen as highly favorable to Russia: it offers Russia tangible gains (recognition of annexed territories, a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, lifting of sanctions) while Ukraine receives only vague security promises and limited territorial returns[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[4](https://nypost.com/2025/04/23/world-news/heres-what-russia-and-ukraine-get-in-trumps-final-offer-peace-deal/)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n* The plan was drafted after Trump’s envoy met with Putin for several hours, fueling perceptions that the proposal is essentially written to satisfy Russian objectives[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Ukrainian Response and International Context\n\n* President Zelensky and Ukrainian officials have categorically rejected the proposal, as it would require Ukraine to accept the loss of sovereign territory and abandon its NATO ambitions, both of which are politically and constitutionally unacceptable in Ukraine[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt seems more than coincidental that every time Ukraine achieves a significant battlefield victory, such as the Vladimir ammunition depot explosion, there is a renewed and urgent push from Trump and his team for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and a deal that heavily favors Russian interests. This pattern supports the perception in Kyiv and among observers that the U.S. peace push is less about supporting Ukraine’s position and more about freezing the conflict before Ukraine can capitalize further on its military momentum[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html)[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Citations:\n\n1.

    "selftext": "On March 18, 2014, the occupiers killed Serhiy Kokurin, a military topographer and ensign of a Ukrainian military unit in Crimea. This was the first military casualty in the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nSergey Kokurin took the military oath in 1997, worked his way up from private to chief of the logistics service, and served in the Simferopol Joint Military Commissariat until the summer of 2013. After that, he became chief of the logistics service of the 13th Photogrammetric Center of the Central Directorate of Military Topography and Navigation of the Main Directorate of Operational Support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, where he served until the events of March 18, 2014.\n\nWhat preceded these events:\nOn February 27, 2014, the so-called “little green men” (Russian military personnel) seized the buildings of the parliament and government of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. \nOn February 28, 2014, the Russians took control of the Simferopol airport and began to block Ukrainian military units.\nOn March 18, 2014, the so-called “local self-defense of Crimea,” consisting of Russian special forces, stormed the 13th photogrammetric center of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Simferopol (also known as the assault on the cartographic unit). During this, a Russian sniper shot and killed Sergei Kokurin, who was at the unit’s observation tower at the time. The Russians captured the cartographic unit within a few hours, firing machine guns at the Ukrainian forces.\n\nLieutenant Colonel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Volodymyr Shchuryk recalls the events of that day:\n“We did not expect that the Russians would launch an armed assault on our unit. We are not a combat unit, but a scientific unit. Moreover, there were no armed assaults anywhere in Simferopol. The people [who carried out the seizure] were armed: pistols, grenades, grenade launchers, machine guns. About a hundred around the entire perimeter [of the unit].”\n\nShortly after, the Russian media quickly spread information about the murder of Kokurin allegedly by a Ukrainian sniper from the “Right Sector” (and that he had supposedly already been convicted), so as not to spoil Putin’s pre-recorded speech about the so-called “unarmed seizure”.\n\nThis was also done in order to hide the obvious fact: the Ukrainian serviceman was killed by Russian special forces. This was proven, in particular, by the official conclusion on the causes of death, according to which Kokurin was killed by two bullets from a 5.45 mm machine gun. The Ukrainian military at that time had only 9 mm pistols.\n\nKokurin was buried at the Abdal city cemetery. The deceased is survived by his mother, 4-year-old son and pregnant wife Olena. Two months later, she gave birth to her second child.\n\nIn July 2014, Sergei Kokurin was posthumously awarded the Order “For Courage” of the 3rd degree.\nThe fact that on March 18, 2014, cartographers in Simferopol were attacked by regular Russian soldiers, and their so-called “self-defense” was a human shield, was later confirmed by the Ukrainian military. As it turned out, the cartographic center was stormed by an FSB sabotage unit under the command of Igor Girkin: he himself told one of the Russian publications about this in November 2014. Shortly after the storming in Simferopol, this FSB unit was transferred to capture Slavyansk. \n\nThe story of the storming of the photogrammetric center — the first, but, as it turned out later, not the only one — became indicative: all the statements of Putin and the Russian media regarding Crimea, as well as regarding the murder of Kokurin, were cynical lies. The Russian Federation started a war to destroy Ukraine. And it started it precisely with Crimea. \n\nOver the next 10 years, Ukraine and the world will repeatedly be convinced that Russia is a terrorist state, that all its statements, from the President to the average military man, are a complete lie. And that its goal was not the “peaceful annexation” (or as the Russians say, “return”) of Crimea, but all of Ukraine at once. \n\nOver the next 11 years after the assault on the cartographic part, the occupiers will commit many more crimes on our territory. And these crimes have not stopped yet. We see every day how the occupiers kill and torture our people (civilians, prisoners of war, political prisoners), how they wipe out settlements, destroy ethnic groups and cultural heritage, how they seize territories and poison the environment. \n\nAnd today it is obvious that if Russia is not stopped, it will not be limited to Ukraine. \nWe remember every citizen of Ukraine who gave their freedom and life for an independent and integral Ukraine. And we call on the international community not to stop opposing Russia at all levels, to increase pressure on the aggressor state, and to promote the earliest possible de-occupation of Crimea. After all, the liberation of all Ukrainian territories will ensure security not only for our country, but also for the entire world.",

We lie when it’s convenient. And we lie just to keep in shape.”**\n\n&gt;I am by no means saying that all Russians are liars, but I think it's safe to say that most Russians are familiar with the concept of *vranyo*. A discipline they know as a cross between sports and the arts. The Potiomkin villages is just one of the incarnations of *vranyo –* one of the older and more harmless ones – with a centuries old history. There are tons of other examples from more recent times, of course.\n\nThis unforgivable tolerance, if not silent encouragement, of the Russians' violent deceitfulness stems from these apologists' and white-knights' delusional self-flagellation, puerile [whataboutism](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Whataboutism), and/or reflexive [anti-Westernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Western_sentiment) (i.e. *West bad, Russia* *~~less bad~~* ***good***).",

    "selftext": "Our (Danish) media has published a good article outlining the timeline of Trumps \"negotiations\" and how he's faltering. I just had to share it.\n\n[https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-04-22-trump-kan-vaere-ved-at-stemple-ud-mener-analytiker](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-04-22-trump-kan-vaere-ved-at-stemple-ud-mener-analytiker)\n\nTranslation via chatGPT:\n\n**Analyst: Trump May Be Tapping Out**\n\nOn Friday, the statement first came from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and shortly thereafter it was confirmed by President Trump: If Russia or Ukraine prove to be “difficult” and refuse to enter a peace agreement, the U.S. will soon withdraw from the peace negotiations and focus on other matters.\n\nAlthough Trump describes himself as the master of all negotiations and for months guaranteed peace within 24 hours of taking office, an agreement still seems illusory. Granted, the 24-hour peace guarantee was later changed to 100 days, but fundamentally, Trump’s envoys have not brought the parties any closer together.\n\nIn short, things have gone wrong because Trump overplayed his hand. He interpreted the situation as if he and Putin held all the strong cards. Back during the bizarre scene in the Oval Office, where the press conference with President Zelensky ended in an argument, Trump shouted, “You don’t have the cards.” That was a misreading. Ukraine *does* have cards, and Trump has managed to play his own hand weakly in front of Putin. That’s why things are falling apart.\n\n**No Aces Up the Sleeve in London**\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, the U.S., Ukraine, France, and the UK will meet in London, and nothing suggests that Trump has any aces up his sleeve. On the contrary, the latest reports from the *Wall Street Journal* indicate that the Trump team is being forced to propose an unrealistic plan.\n\nAccording to the newspaper’s sources, the Trump administration’s proposal now is that Ukraine should cede Crimea to Russia and give up any prospect of joining NATO. Furthermore, the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia should be placed under U.S. control.\n\nThe proposal does not mention what is to happen with the four partially occupied provinces—Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson—which Putin has had written into Russia’s constitution and thus lays claim to. Nor are there any security guarantees for Ukraine. In other words, Ukraine must make concessions but gets nothing tangible in return.\n\nEven the first demand—to give up Crimea—is completely unrealistic. Ukraine is a democracy, and it would require a constitutional amendment that is unlikely to gain support. If Zelensky were to accept this demand, it would likely be political suicide and would strengthen Ukrainian nationalism. It would be like asking a Danish prime minister to give up Bornholm.\n\nWith security guarantees and temporary status for parts of the occupied areas, there might be a chance.\n\n**Europe Is a Trump Card for Ukraine**\n\nSince the beginning of Trump’s so-called “peace negotiations,” the strategy has been to try to strong-arm Ukraine into submission. Trump wanted to force the party he believed held the weak hand at the table to surrender.\n\nHad Ukraine stood completely isolated, that strategy might have had a chance. But Ukraine is not isolated. Trump underestimated the support Ukraine has received from European countries as well as from Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Among NATO’s 32 members, only the U.S. and Hungary have chosen to follow Trump’s course.\n\nTrump has therefore underestimated Europe’s willingness to collectively back Ukraine. The many summits called at short notice in various European capitals with different country constellations in recent months have shown this support.\n\nThey all agree that only Ukraine itself can decide whether to give up territory and that any agreement would be unsustainable without robust security guarantees. The UK and France will almost certainly maintain that stance at the London meeting. Europeans know that conceding to Putin’s territorial demands will only lead to more demands and would be a ticking time bomb under Europe’s security.\n\n**Trump Has Strengthened Putin’s Hand**\n\nBecause of Trump’s misreading of the situation, he has, since taking power, handed many valuable cards to Putin. This includes issues such as territorial concessions, NATO membership, security guarantees, support for Russia in the UN, and fully adopting Russia’s narrative of the war. All of these trump cards have been given to Putin without Trump demanding anything in return.\n\nParallel to the peace negotiations over Ukraine, Trump has even initiated talks on normalizing relations between the U.S. and Russia—both diplomatically and economically, with Trump’s lead negotiator, Steve Witkoff, openly highlighting how lucrative the Trump administration sees opportunities in Russia.\n\nTherefore, Putin has had no incentive to make a single compromise on Ukraine. His war aim of gaining control over all of Ukraine remains intact. He knows that Trump is more focused on lucrative deals than on defending international law, Ukraine’s survival as an independent state, and Europe’s security.\n\n**War Is Much More Than a Card Game**\n\nIf we rewind to that scandalous evening in the Oval Office, Zelensky tried to interject, “This is not about playing cards.” Trump didn’t listen. But the war is indeed about much more than three parties at a card table, where the nearly 40 million Ukrainians are the weak party, supposedly forced to capitulate.\n\nTrump could, for instance, have listened when NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Cavoli, testified before Congress on April 3. There, the U.S. top general in Europe explained that Ukraine is actually holding up fairly well in the war. They have been under pressure but have resolved many of their military challenges. They are far from losing.\n\nMost recently, Secretary Rubio announced that he will not attend the Wednesday meeting in London. This suggests that Trump may be giving up on the effort and tapping out. Regardless of the realities, Ukraine will likely be blamed for the collapse.",

Unfortunately, this is what so many Westerners keep misunderstanding about the Russians with their genocidal self-entitlement and age-old supremacist complex opposite the Ukrainians.\n\n&gt;*...there is the view that the very idea of Russia without Little Russia, or Ukraine is inconceivable. The dean of twentieth-century Russian specialists of Kievan Rus', Dmitrii Likhachev, best summed up this attitude: \"Over the course of the centuries following their division into two entities, Russia and Ukraine have formed not only a political by also a culturally dualistic unity. Russian culture is meaningless without Ukrainian, as Ukrainian is without Russian.\"*\n\nFrom Magocsi, P.R. \"A History of Ukraine: The Land and its Peoples\", 2010\n\nTo so many Russians, including highly educated ones like [Likhachev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Likhachev), Ukrainians and their culture are *nothing* without the Russians and theirs. Therefore, it stands to their malign reason that they are ultimately \"saving\" the Ukrainians by Russifying them via socioeconomic pressure or military force - whatever suits the Russians' depraved tastes on a given day.\n\nOnly Ukrainians (but also to a large extent, Finns, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, Belarusians, Poles, Moldovans, Romanians, Crimean Tatars and others in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Eastern Europe) know what the Russians truly mean when the latter want \"to talk\".",

We know that they CAN do that.\n\nInstead, the Russians selected an airburst area-effect warhead, which is utterly useless against even moderately protected targets such as inside of buildings (never mind basements), and is only useful against unprotected targets in the open - i.e. civilians if the target is in a city.\n\nLikewise, the restaurant Magellan (supposedly targeted for being a meeting point of 100500 NATO officers but still missed by 100 m), is not even called Magellan any more - the previous owners closed and sold Magellan 2 years ago and until the attack it was called RoseMarine. If at all it was a target, it shows that Russians either shoot at random civilian targets or have absolutely atrocious, utterly useless targetting intelligence which amounts to exactly the same thing.",

        "body": "From the article: It has been nearly 100 days since Donald Trump returned to the U.S. presidency and Russian missiles continue to rain down on Ukrainian civilians. Despite Trump’s pledge to end the war on “day one,” peace is nowhere in sight. When will the administration acknowledge that it is failing?\n\nTrump’s initial demands were straightforward: stop fighting and start negotiating. After his first conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he announced that a complete cessation of fighting was imminent, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed that prospect.\n\nSince then, however, Putin and his small team at the Kremlin have obviously succeeded in dragging Trump’s inexperienced negotiator, Steve Witkoff, down a rabbit hole of complex conditionalities and impossible demands. After many weeks of this, even the most dimwitted of negotiators should have realized that Putin has no intention of agreeing to a ceasefire or accepting Trump’s plan or timetable.\n\nEver since he launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has relied on Russian military might to deliver him control over Ukraine. He went in with an army of roughly 200,000 contract soldiers, but has since expanded the invasion force to around 600,000 with selective mobilizations and huge financial incentives. Yet despite suffering 700,000-800,000 casualties, with more than 200,000 dead, the supposedly mighty Russian army controls less Ukrainian territory — 18.3% to be precise — than it did at this time three years ago.\n\nThus, in military terms, Putin’s war has been a massive failure. He probably still believes that his forces can grind their way forward and achieve some military breakthrough. But few independent observers see much chance of that happening. Russia may be able to throw more men and bombs into the battle than Ukraine can, but it cannot instill in those on the front lines the will to fight. So far, defense has proven much easier than offense. That means Putin is ultimately more dependent on Trump than on the Russian military to deliver something that could be called a victory.\n\nThus, Putin has deployed all the resources at his disposal to play Trump. Everyone knows that the U.S. president is highly susceptible to flattery, and Putin has gone overboard in arguing that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was “stolen,” and that the war never would have happened with Trump in office. He wants us to believe that he went to his private chapel to pray for Trump after the assassination attempt in 2024, and he has even had the Kremlin court artist paint a portrait of Trump as a gift.\n\n\"Putin has deployed all the resources at his disposal to play Trump.\"\n\nIn addition to flattery, the Russians have also dangled lucrative business prospects before Trump and Witkoff. In the first encounter between U.S. and Russian negotiators in Riyadh, Putin’s team brought a list of multi-billion-dollar investment opportunities that would supposedly become available if only Trump ditched Ukraine and lifted the sanctions against Russia. According to Witkoff, a good portion of his latest meeting with Putin was devoted to this topic.",

Yet despite suffering 700,000-800,000 casualties, with more than 200,000 dead, the supposedly mighty Russian army controls less Ukrainian territory — 18.3% to be precise — than it did at this time three years ago.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, in military terms, Putin’s war has been a massive failure.\n\nWhile quite a lot of territory that ruSSia occupied when they launched their full-scale invasion in early 2022 was liberated again by Ukraine throughout 2022, you also have to consider that ruSSia still occupies a *lot* more territory now than they did before 2022... so was it really a complete failure?   \n\nSure, they went from the \"#2 military in the world\" to the laughing stock of the world that despite constant war crimes and complete disregard of any international laws couldn't even beat one much smaller country, but ruSSia has a land-bridge to occupied Crimea now and appears solidly entrenched on Ukrainian territory...\n\nWhat is true is that ruSSia hasn't been able to break Ukraine as a country militarily and only managed to (hopefully temporarily) steal some territory, and thus relies on the traitor Trump to help them...",

He proposed a further halt to any long-range attacks for at least 30 days — something the Kremlin rejected earlier on Sunday.\n\n“If Russia does not agree to such a step, it will be proof that it only wants to … destroy people’s lives and continue the war,” Zelensky posted on Telegram.\n\nOn the ground in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Major Ivan Skuratovskiy said that the boom of artillery from the nearby front was constant and Russian drones continued to attack. “\\[The Russians\\] did not hear their butcher,” he said, referring to Putin.\n\nOleksandr Kovalenko, a Ukrainian political analyst, said that Putin’s truce was an attempt to convince Trump that Russia had not entirely turned its back on the peace efforts. “Putin wants to convince the White House that he is interested in peace and to continue to drag out this pointless process that allows him to prolong the war without further worries,” he wrote on social media",

Now he's likely still \"undecided\" in that annoying way wanting to stay out of politics because it has come back to bite him on the ass. At least he was right about vaccines, systemic racism, and ultimately refused to play for Trump's inauguration. SO, surprisingly he might be the most justifiably libertarian and honestly opinionated guy in the band. (I just have a hard time trusting anyone that was on celebrity apprentice). Ace Frehley is the most  defiantly fanatical Trump supporter, supporting him in his concerts (at least up to the last election), telling people to support Trump or “move to another country,”Peter Criss is super religious and refuses to talk about politics so I can probably make a correct guess at what he supports. Paul Stanley appears to have made a complete 180 degree turn after making some anti-transitioning remarks that upset the LGBTQ community.  He is probably a decent guy, with his calls for unity now sounding a bit tone deaf in retrospect:\n\n&gt;\"IT'S OVER.
