The 'coup' I assume you're referring to, the Euromaidan, basically involved Janukovich getting boo(t)ed out of office by protestors, as he fled to Russia. Zelensky got elected 5 years later. I agree that it's somewhat silly that a TV-star became a president, but it's not stranger than a Reagan or a Trump getting elected. People recognize him, I guess.

Where are you getting the 'then got hundreds of billions of dollars from America' from? Are you talking about the military and humanitarian aid?

Then the 'trying to join NATO which was forbidden'... Source? Are you referring to the Budapest Memorandum? Based on which Ukraine gave up it's nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, which were later obviously violated? Nothing about NATO was included here...

I know someone who’s genuinely intelligent, but somehow ended up deep in an obscure conspiracy rabbit hole. Now, he just parrots Russian misinformation—sometimes it’s a heavily skewed selection of facts, other times it’s outright nonsense.

I like to believe that most people genuinely want to be well-informed. But at some point, they became so skeptical of anything that challenges their pre-existing narrative that they’d rather believe complete fabrications than trust mainstream sources.

I think it's really healthy to be moderately sceptical of a 'mainstream' publication, but not to the extent it's being treated now by some people.

Calling the guy a russian bootlicker does nothing but drive him further in his beliefs. I personally have enormous respect for people who were able to climb out of the rabbit hole, and I hope OP would as well.",2025-02-25T11:16:20

&gt;”…all while trying to join NATO which was explicitly forbidden in the contract that gave them their freedom when the Soviet Union was disbanded”

In fact, why don’t you Google the Budapest Memorandum and see how Russia and the US are not holding *their* end of the bargain. Additionally, there’s no verbiage about the topic you mentioned in the memorandum *or* their Declaration of Independence. Maybe I’m unaware of a document or treaty?

Ukraine has made it a priority of theirs to achieve NATO membership for a *long* time, not just in 2022 (which is when Putin started his invasion).

When you mention a coup, are you talking about the overthrowing of the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych? What’s the issue here? The people did not want him, and they considered him a traitor.

&gt; “…put a reality TV star in as president”

Oh, like the United States? And again, what’s the problem? He was elected democratically and has proved to be an extremely strong maritime leader.

After russia's annexation of Crimea the Parliament removed the neutrality part, with 303 out of 309 MPs voting in favor of the decision.

They’re everywhere. On billboards, the sides of buildings, at bus stops. Portraits with the words “Hero of Russia”. Posters of troops with Kalashnikov rifles encouraging the public to “Love, be proud of and defend” Russia.
In other words, to sign up and go and fight in Ukraine. Three years after its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Russia is seeking new recruits.
Despite all the military imagery around town, if you live in Tver it’s possible to convince yourself that life is normal. The front line is hundreds of miles away.


“Just look around,” Mikhail, a local teacher, tells me. “Cars are passing by and all the shops are open. No shells are falling from anywhere. We are not panicking. We can’t hear any sirens wailing. We do not run to any evacuation points.”
For many Russians their invasion of Ukraine – what the Kremlin still calls a “special military operation” – is something they only encounter on their TV screens.
But for people like Anna, it’s much more real.
Anna and her daughter
Image caption, Some people Anna knew never came back from fighting in Ukraine
“I know a lot of people who went off to fight,” Anna says when we get chatting on the street.
“Some of them never came home. I hope [the war] ends as soon as possible.”
Donald Trump claims that’s what he wants, too. Without inviting Ukraine to the negotiating table, the Trump administration has already entered direct talks with the Russian leadership.
What do Russians make of the US president and his overtures to Moscow?
“Trump is a dark horse,” believes Anna. “I’m not sure what to expect from him.”",2025-02-22T11:40:45

1172z4w,Biden makes surprise trip to Ukraine ahead of Russian invasion anniversary,AskMeAnythingIAnswer,499,2023-02-20T10:02:36,AskMeAnythingIAnswer,11,"&gt; KYIV, Ukraine — President Biden made a dramatic, unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday, in a display of strong American support for Ukraine just four days before the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion.

&gt; The high-risk visit, to a Ukrainian capital that has been under threat of missile attacks, signals continued commitment from the United States, the largest financial and military backer of Ukraine’s effort to repel Russian invaders from its territory.

&gt; Biden was spotted outside St. Michael Golden-Domed Monastery with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Ukrainian capital was in a tight security lockdown with car traffic halted and even pedestrians blocked from certain streets. Shortly afterward, an air raid siren went off in the city.

&gt; Biden has insisted the U.S. will continue to back Ukraine for “as long as it takes” despite flagging support among the American public and no near-term prospect of peace talks to end the conflict.

&gt; The Biden administration has provided some $30 billion in security aid since President Vladimir Putin sent Russian forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, initiating the largest ground war in Europe since World War II — one that already has cost his country and Ukraine hundreds of thousands of casualties.

&gt; Under Biden’s leadership, the U.S. and its NATO allies have gradually expanding the array of weaponry they have pledged to include heavy tanks.

&gt; While other world leaders have visited Kyiv to meet with Zelensky over the past year, and tour the war-scarred city, Biden has stayed away due to security concerns and fears about the possibility of conflict between the world’s two largest nuclear powers, sending senior aides in his place. First Lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Western Ukraine on Mother’s Day in May.

&gt; His visit was shrouded in secrecy. Biden was due to leave for an announced visit to Poland from Washington on Monday evening.",2023-02-20T10:04:37

He used this exact quote to go on a tirade about this authoritarian daring to come into our Congress wearing sweatpants and demanding money. Who does he think he is, stealing our money?!

Then... he AIRED THE CLIP. Huge mistake. I've no idea who in the newsroom allowed that to happen, because the clip instantly contradicted what Tucker just said. Now, I know most viewers won't notice because they can only understand what Tucker tells them to think. But I was sort of dumbfounded.

A few minutes later, proud bigot and anti-civil-rights pro-terrorism propagandist Glenn Greenwald sleezes his way on screen and spends a few minutes oozing a word salad about how Putin is right to kill ethnic minorities and try to take over the Orthodox church through puppet proxies to control religion in Ukraine.

None of it really made sense, and Greenwald came very close to explicitly advocating for Putin seeking out a final solution to the Ukraine problem. So they cut to footage of the chaos in El Paso where the invading brown vermin are climbing over border walls (with footage showing how easy it is to climb; only a total moron would rely on just a wall to keep out migrants) and pretended the speech never happened. 

And then Tulsi Gabbard showed up with concerns that immigrants might not be immediately imprisoned or incinerated or something.

Not that any of that matters. But through my disgust I found it encouraging that even Fox News and Tucker Carlson aren't willing to spend a lot of time on the subject. By drawing attention, it creates awareness, and the morality is so clear on the most cursory consideration that creating awareness is VERY bad for their Putin-ordered messaging.",2022-12-22T04:04:24

It's literally your job so not attending is just a stunt.

Most Americans don't get paid if they don't go to work but that's literally what they did.  Ask them and see how they spin and talk around it without any substance.

MJG for example doesn't hold any committee positions, they were stripped because even the R's think she's fucking crazy so she pretty much has no say in anything and has to resort to stunts.

What really disgusts me are the elected members of my government screaming ""no, that's our flag"" from the upper decks.

This man has seen war in a way few of us will and has left his country at great danger to himself for the first time since.  He's just given us his flag, signed by men who may be dead as I type.

There is no difference between a publicly ran and government ran institution, the only difference is where the cash comes from. There is no such thing as a government ran fast-food chain, because they don't fund those. There is largely no such thing as a publicly ran street paving system, because the public is largely not willing to pay for something like that since they don't all equally have as much to gain from a public service like that. It's a government funded institution because taxes can pay for a public good that overall benefits the public, but doesn't marginally benefit them enough for them to willingly pay for it. Governments pay for public goods that are beneficial but don't succeed in the public market, there is no reason to subsidize a normal company that makes profits with taxes if it doesn't produce a necessary public good. There is no reason to privatize a required government company that doesn't make enough revenue to stay in business.

That’s why people voted for Biden it seems. Trump was a very dislikable character. He was even a bit insane for the republicans because while he achieved most of his goals he was a terrible public figure. The fact trump was not a good president is not merit to discredit the entire republican party because by the same vain Joe Biden is not a good president and you could discredit the entire democratic party. You shouldn’t discredit either. To think in a binary of “us v.s. Them” you’re not actually thinking. You’re blindly accepting their ideology that freedom of thought is offensive and therefore shouldn’t be said. Freedom is offensive. In order to say anything you have to risk someone disagreeing with you.

Inflation reduction act. Limits drug costs. Starts to open up medicare negotiations. FORCES a minimum corporate tax. 

Improved veteran medical funding/care. This woudl be the Jon Stewart burn pit fun. 

The Chips act which will bring ~50k+ plus $100k plus a year jobs into Az and Ohio directly. But also helps secure the semiconductor sectors. Huge boosts to basically the ENTIRE working base of the US when expanded out. 

Ended Afghanistan war. The LONGEST war in US history. 

Finally passed the violence against women act. 

The American rescue plan act. Which helped get the schools/businesses running again post pandemic. 

I'm skipping over EO's but add those in and you get to add student loan forgiveness. 

Economically, we're in a hyper inflation mode (which sucks) due directly due to pandemic responses from 2019-2021. BUT we are also at record lows for unemployment, record highs for wages, and record high for jobs available. 

Immigration we are record levels of drug seizures, stopped illegal immigrants, and funding/support for the various border organizations (I'll expand on why this is happening below so keep your panties out of a bind)*

Internationally: He stopped Russia dead in its tracks by uniting NATO and basically every democracy on the planet to cause them to likely lose Crimea and they are risking losses from past invasions due to Biden's actions. Basically Russia never thought the ""West"" could put a unified front up. Biden, and ~3-4 big leaders did that. This also has reverberated through the world and set a clear precedent that China is FUCKED if it steps out of line (granted they are masters of moving the line). 

*Now to the immigration one, because this is BY FAR my favorite item to talk about. Trump did it, not Biden. BUT Trump can't claim it due to it highlights his broken policies. Basically, the first wave of wall funding didn't go to building a wall, it went to upgrading checkpoints, upgrading roads/supports to them, and basically building out EXISTING locations that would enable border security and safety. He hated that. The only funding he received for the wall, built ZERO wall. He later attempted to reappropiate funding to build an actual wall and it failed. His buddies also are likely headed to jail for using the lack of a wall to steal from Americans. 

BUT it gets better! Trump didn't get the funding for the wall BECAUSE none of the border security groups asked for it OR thought it would remotely work. The ""new wall"" that did get built is ALREADY FALLEN cut or basically trash. FURTHER, Trump failed to fill most of the critical appointments within DHS, INS, Border Patrol, and several other orgs. Instead relying on temporary or vacant seats. 

SO Biden got to walk in, get fully upgraded equipment and staff, and all he had to do was put competent people in their roles. (Of note, most of those appointments actually pissed off his base as shockingly they were GOP lifers for the most part (ironically most are now RINO's per the group).

Dudes been solid. Depending on 22 he's going to end up mid tier in overall POTUS rankings. He's not going to end up top 10. BUT if he can keep things rolling as a democracy until 2028 (back to the other sides biggest issue IMO) he'll be ok.",2022-09-21T17:41:11

A drunk guy killed another guy and claimed the other was part of some Republican extremist group.  I don’t see any proof Brandt was a liberal or Ellington was a Republican, just Brandt’s word while intoxicated at this point.

&gt;	Shannon Brandt, 41, killed 18-year-old Cayler Ellingson early Sunday in McHenry with an SUV in an alley, KVRR-TV reported. He is charged with vehicular homicide and leaving the scene of a deadly accident.

&gt;	Brandt reportedly called 911 to report the crash, authorities said. Authorities said he was allegedly drunk at the time. 

&gt;	Court documents said he told a 911 dispatcher the teen was part of a Republican ""extremist group"" and was calling people to go after him following an unspecified political argument. 

&gt;	Ellingson's mother told police her son called her before the crash, asking if she knew Brandt. She said she did but that she did not believe her son knew him.

No, it isn't true. It's the difference between being with your mom in the hospital during her cancer treatment and merely sending a nice card. Both are figurative, but only one is meaningful.

I have, and they didn't say any of that shit. Gosar said the resolution could be perceived as an endorsement of Ukraine to NATO leading to direct war with Russia, and we have our own border issues to face. Others said it effectively called for direct US involvement, including boots on the ground, and that's a bridge too far for them. I find those reasons stupid, when you could just say ""this does nothing, it's just a non-binding resolution saying nice words when it could be a bill taking useful action"". 

Of course, the GOP *has* introduced measures that actually *do* take useful action, such as Lindsay Graham's measure to back Ukraine in international Court against Putin's war crimes.

Do you know what the word “include” means? It’s not limited to the reason I stated. Those reasons are objectively invalid. Still, voting against a resolution regardless of its effective or not is significant.

&gt;Of course, the GOP has introduced measures that actually do take useful action, such as Lindsay Graham's measure to back Ukraine in international Court against Putin's war crimes.

 In Russia they were turning nationalist against Pakistani refugees 15-20yrs ago.

The comments were walked back. Brandon just gave Putin’s propagandists a clip they’ll play on repeat for the next 2 years. At least with Trump, when he said stupid, dangerous, outrageous shit like this, no one took him that seriously.

I’ve spent the whole day thinking he wanted to get us all killed, and I’m American. How do you think it plays to people abroad? He must sound completely mad.

The only options on the table cannot be regime change or continued escalation to nuclear war. This rhetoric wasn’t even that far off from the prior escalations either. If you officially brand someone as a war criminal, it’s a small step to say, there must be regime change. What happens to war criminals after regime change? They’re hanged. So Putin wins the war or he is executed for war crimes. If that’s the game, time to duck and cover and kiss my ass goodbye.

Biden was far from the strongest candidate to ever run for President, but I do think foreign policy is one of, if not his strongest area of expertise. And it’s an area in which he is VERY strong in. In a way, he kind of got lucky that so much focus is being paid to foreign policy so far.

Even with Afghanistan, everyone points to that as some disaster. And to a degree it was, and it baffles me how the Intel community did not predict the speed and easy with which the Taliban would take over. I think that has more to do with the Intel community on that, but the the buck does always stop with the President. That being said, even with that massive fuck up, Biden and his team were able to orchestrate a pretty amazing rescue operation on the fly with very little time to plan for it. And yes there was unfortunately one suicide bomb that went off and killed 13 US Service members and some civilians, but I feel like i’m taking crazy pills when people point that one incident out as some massive fuck up. Did everyone forget how many suicide bombs and other guerrilla warfare attacks had happened in Afghanistan over the past 20 years? The fact that there was ONLY one that occurred during that chaotic time is a blessing.

I don’t know who is to blame for the initial intelligence failure that led to the Taliban sweeping across the entire country in a matter of hours rather than weeks or months, but everything outside of that was handled pretty amazingly in retrospect.

Trump claims he would have done it different, but he set Biden up to fail and his bullshit hindsight about how he would have done it doesn’t hold water.

The obvious (a word you really like to use) answer here is that he was helping Putin weaken both NATO and Ukraine so that Putin could exert his power over Ukraine with no consequences.

Putin started ramping up last year after Biden won the election. Why?

The obvious answer here is that Putin waited to see who won so he could decide his next moves regarding Ukraine. If Trump, wait until NATO and Ukraine are weakened and then invade with little to no consequences. If Biden, build up, find any way to justify an invasion, and work with what Trump had already given you before Biden has enough time to re-strengthen NATO and support Ukraine fully.

We got option number two. What nobody really expected was for NATO to work as a unit and set aside their internal squabbles. A united west was the worst thing that could've happened to Putin and that's exactly what Biden and the other NATO leaders accomplished.",2022-03-26T20:41:43

Bolton published a memoir in 2020 that described Trump as repeatedly saying he wanted to quit the alliance, saying at one point, “I don’t give a s--- about NATO.” Bolton said he had to convince Trump not to quit NATO in the middle of a 2018 summit.

I’ll admit it’s fishing on Biden’s part and maybe nothing will come of it. But tapping a wedge in between Putin and every other Russian isn’t a bad strategy. 

Even if everyone around Putin who has the advantage of toppling him or poisoning his food is completely loyal, they could still wonder “what if what Biden says makes Putin distrust me and winds up getting me killed? Maybe I should Tywin him next time he goes to the toilet.” 

And even if they don’t do that, Putin himself might think, “I do have loyal staff, but what if they start doubting that I think they’re loyal and they try to off me? I need to get rid of them!”

And even if neither party does anything, that paranoia might still compound to the point that Putin trusts nobody, not even his own intelligence about the war, isolating himself away from everyone until he’s effectively not leading anyone anymore and some other player in the wings swoops in to take command.",2022-03-26T23:48:12

It makes no difference to the here and now if there was or wasn't. What he was or represented was bastardized to the nth degree through decades long game of telephone. That has been changing ever since. Whatever biases of man were at the time... it so aligned with the religious texts... and that continues to this day. So much shit I have heard that people read into them that is just not there. And their offspring and relatives hear those biases and further pervert it. 

For instance this is one thing I hear a ton of. ""god said that no homosexual would ever be allowed to enter the kingdom of heaven"". There is so much wrong with that it's not even funny. Trying to debate any part of that is just met with a brick wall of denialism. I have even gone so far as to say I will bet you $1,000 right now that you can't find that written anywhere in the bible. Same with for some reason they kept saying that Patrisse Cullors was arrested by the FBI, and something along the lines of her saying something is racist and the FBI said no ma'am this is stealing.

I am close to the same, I see it like if full atheist is +10 and agnostic was -10 I'd probably be a +7.

I do think if there is a god of some kind, he/she/it is no where near what humans invented... and he/she/it just doesn't give a shit. No grand plan, no grand design, etc. 

I think a really advanced simulation with piss poor AI makes more sense than any religion I have seen. 

&gt;But I did grow up in the American South

Grew up southern baptist but jumping foster homes I have been to quite a few different churches. Catholics and evangelicals probably the most insane experiences. 

&gt;and I had a decent education on the Bible

Can't say I have had that, but I have read it, but every time I tried asking questions to get a better understanding it all eventually got down to ""you can't question god"", and my response of ""I am questioning you"", didn't fly too well. Seems to me like an omnipotent being could withstand a few questions... 

&gt;The fact that these people couldn't see that Trump is an antichrist, according to their own fucking book, doesn't shock me at all.

I find churches to be where the sinners go. Yes I am generalizing a bit, but it holds true for a lot of people I have met. I find that they go to church to wash away the sins so to speak. They can do whatever they want, so long as they put some money in the collection plate, they have secured their seat in heaven. When I was ""saved"" I remember a lot of talk about going to church and all that was to bring you closer to god, and basically make it so you sin less? It's been a while so I may be slightly off with my memory. But looking around at the people who have been ""with god"" the longest... didn't look like it was working for them, and they weren't magically better people. 

I try to help those that I can because I think it's the right thing to do. I don't try to help someone and take a selfie for god saying hey, keep my seat warm, look at all the good I am doing... Then brag about every small thing you do for someone.

One critique I've had since day 1 is that I think we could be offering more olive branches and off ramps, and sometimes things like calling Putin a war criminal off the cuff (while obviously true) tends to close more crucial diplomatic doors than needed. The bottom line is, this is not the typical adversary. He is frustrated, bogged down, and with his ""back to the wall."" The most prominent weapons he has are WMDs. As this war drags on and tensions rise, who's to say those won't be in the table? Simply put, they can't be. So we need diplomacy, no matter how bitter it tastes. This is an unpredictable situation, with unpredictable people. We need level-headed deterrence and cooperation.

The issue is that Russia’s demands have been insanely unreasonable from day one, so even giving them something that they want here is going to end up rewarding their war of choice. If you start talking about restricting Ukraine from NATO forever, all you’re doing is telling Russia that “yeah invade a country and NATO can be off the table” as well as telling Ukraine “we will never officially protect you despite the fact that you have been invaded and they will want to do it again.”

(And I don’t even support Ukraine joining NATO)

Way to pick a CNN article from a year ago, based on pure speculation. Guess cnn as a source is praised among you republicans when it works in your favor. Here's an msnbc article that states Biden's set to reduce the debt

https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/amp/rcna19711

""Inflation started the day biden took office"" what a silly stance. Inflation is high around the globe in 2021, imagine linking that to Biden lmao. 

Biden and our allies put more sanctions on Putin that trump did, that's a fact. Trump tried to get Putin back in the G summit and lift sanctions, that's a fact. He said ""I don't know why it would be Russia"" in front of the whole world and then backpedalled like a weakling and said he meant to say ""wouldn't"". 

Oh no Biden looking to other countries to help with oil reserves what a terrible president? What?

You have the weakest arguments all cherry picked , the same week articles go out that say Saudi Arabia aren't ""taking his calls"" follow up by saying they eventually will need to speak as the leader needs western help for his vision and future projects. 


Name things Biden has done without bringing up trump, again record jobs growth and employment numbers, healthcare plan, infrastructure bill.

So there really is no one single ""best candidate"" anyway. There are *many* best candidates if we go on merit alone - of all races, sexes, backgrounds, etc. And historically, women and minorities have had less opportunities to even be in these positions at all (and I'd argue that still holds true).

Romney’s failure led to their own postmortem that said that Republicans needed to become more immigrant friendly, less extremist in general, and needed to appeal to more than just non-college educated whites and Evangelicals. Basically go for a bigger tent. 

They flatly refused that advice, because the above radical base of that contracting party would never accept any of that. They built that base on white grievance and fake news rage against “liberals” through AM radio and Fox propaganda that had no foundation after the collapse of Neo-Con empire building under Bush, save being the opposite of the Democrats at any given moment. “Us versus them” tactics will never let you bring in some of “them”. 

So Republicanism though primaries refined itself into the purest “outrage porn” individual that base could find, Donald Trump, the bully they’d been looking for since McCain shut down supporters raging against Obama being not American. 

The leadership knows they’re not the majority. They know they have contracting appeal, but as the saying goes, Conservatives will abandon democracy before they abandon the purity of their ideas. And so now they cheat.

There are confounders in those numbers, but by all accounts the trump administration at least maintained the same volume of drone strikes.

One theory about why Putin invaded now instead of waiting is that he figured the Democrats would be hamstrung by the midterms--since they would not sanction oil so they would not lose the midterms...

He was counting on the GOP to do his dirty work for him of kneecapping the US response.

Republicans are actively working against US security interests and global security.

Basically, they think if you just make nice to Putin everything will be OK. They are willing to be Putin's lackey and disable our capacity to protect Europe and NATO countries if they can beat the Democrats. 

Putin assassinated some of  his allies in the Donbas to get his people put at the head of the Russian friendly leadership. They are so stupid. They really believe he's just going to 'be nice' and go along with the USA in the future if we don't rile him up or something. 

Or else they don't care if the US IS under the control of Russia. They don't mind letting the Saudis do whatever they want. They are fine with that. They are fine with the fact all the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis, with Saudi killing of Khashoggi. Kushner gave the Saudis all the things they wanted. 

So what's one more country to give carte blanche to?

The greed. We thought we would have our national security undermined spies or whatever...but no we are actually seeing our government bought by wealthy dictators of petrostates.

I'm not an expert on Eastern Europe, but most of Western Europe thinks that the Democratic Party is too far-right for them. The Republican Party is viewed even more poorly. I acknowledged that Ukrainians would never be liberal or particularly left voting. In fact, I implied that despite Trump's criminal betrayal towards them religion and conservative values would win out and they'd likely vote fairly neutrally.

Besides, other than abortion and other strictly moral/ethical/religious policies, Ukrainians themselves are pretty liberal on the US spectrum of politics. Socialized, universal healthcare is guaranteed to citizens of Ukraine, on paper. In practice, this doesn't reach most segments of the population. However, pre-war, that was being improved by FURTHER socialization and government funding rather than privatization or defunding. Ukraine spends a relatively high percent of GDP on social safety nets that, when fully funded under the USSR eclipsed the US's current programs. These safety nets were being reformed by INCREASING budgets for them (though these reforms admittedly came with decentralization, which is a more conservative viewpoint in the US).

I also think that a low unemployment rate means fewer people competing for the open jobs, meaning workers can afford to be more selective, leaving the shit jobs understaffed because employers don't take steps to make them less shitty.

There’s a good reason many stockpiled leases remain undeveloped: there may be no oil and gas to be found there, or companies discover that it’s not economically feasible to drill, said Angela Franklin, a partner at Holland and Hart LLP in Salt Lake City who represents industry clients.

“We don’t get to pick and choose where the oil is located,” she said, adding that there’s a “tremendous amount of acres that is not developed and may never be developed” because companies haven’t found oil or gas. It’s also possible companies have leases on too little land in one place to justify drilling there, she said.

While jedburghofficial might be incorrect about who's responsible for what...damn, that's fucked.

France and Germany would apparently rather blow Putin than support a fellow democracy, because he wasn't a threat, in their mind, to the status quo in Europe. At least Germany had the spine to own up to being wrong and begin re-arming; I don't see France doing the same.

Ukraine 'went too far' by electing leaders not aligned with Russia. Russia is claiming to ""denazify"" Ukraine. Hurt feewings about a NATO alliance that is uninterested in expansion and that fact is widely known is a poor rationale for invasion, especially since Russia pretty much invaded the place 8 years ago and never left.

And they argue that Russia’s willingness to go to war over Ukraine’s NATO status, which it perceived as an existential national security threat and **listed as a fundamental part of its rationale for the invasion**, was so clear for so long that dropping support for its eventual entry could have averted the invasion.

This would be a valid argument if NATO status was the reason for the invasion. Problem is, Putin declared that 'denazification' was the reason for the invasion, and NATO status was irrelevant. Not to mention that prior to the previous Russin invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine had no real plan to join NATO, but Russia annexed Crimea anyways.

We don't usually want to subsidize expensive things, unless its short term, since that distorts the market and delays solutions.

I had a long paragraph typed, but at any rate if you could say convert an F-150 for $10k, then you might pay in ten years a total of around $15k for fuel (electricity).  Gas would cost around $32k or so for 12k miles over the same period assuming $5/gal gas.  Of course actual conversion prices are around double that, but I tend to think economies of scale would drive the price down, though again we would need to pick probably one or only a few models and focus.

t9iypl,Biden to ban Russian oil imports in retaliation for Ukraine invasion,tophatthis,86,2022-03-08T15:14:30,GuerreroUltimo,11,"We export oil.  One of the big things hidden in the talk about more oil production here is that the ones that mention it always throw in the exporting covered by saying we could be energy independent.  Well, their goal is not to keep it here it is to export it anyway.  

&amp;#x200B;

We all knew that gas prices would jump.  They were jumping before we banned Russian imports.  They were jumping before anything was really changed at all.  Any time they can they gouge prices.  They know the American public will jump on the politics and blame.  Never looking at the fact that things were jumping before any impact.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of exporting we could maybe use that here.  Keep those prices down.  But what is actually happening is gouging on price and that will never be taken care of.  The same Republicans in my area that throw the cost blame on Democrats would scoff at any kind of regulation on exports that would bring prices down.  They just do not realize that if we drill more oil we would just export it.  That was a huge reason for the pipeline enhancement they wanted to do.  Get more of that oil to the cost to ship and sell.",2022-03-08T15:29:36

t9iypl,Biden to ban Russian oil imports in retaliation for Ukraine invasion,tophatthis,86,2022-03-08T15:14:30,GuerreroUltimo,0,"I mean, I guess.  There is a reason I was a straight A student in college in all my business classes though.  I took enough to get a degree but I was in Mathematics and Physics.  I also took a ton of biology classes like Genetics, 2 levels of Micro, a few Environmental Science classes, and shit like that.  I graduated with slightly less than a 4.0 simply because I got a B in a class on education theory and a B in a class on fine art.  

&amp;#x200B;

Not a brag here but I was told by the Dean, Dr.  Magraine of the Biology department that I had a future if I chose to study that.  Same by the Dean of the Business school.  During my partial differentials class a  professor from MIT was doing a presentation.  After class he offered me an associate position were I would work under hm and work on my advance degree.  Almost took it but I had my wife and young son here and I did not want to be away.  Later offered a position and Johns Hopkins University.  My big thing was that I mad a killing on the stock market game as a young man.  I invested in stocks as a game, mostly due to a college class that required a fake investment tracking making me realize how much I could make.

That was a good time for me.  I invest in a company, just one example, that was $1.  Jumped to $3.17 and I sold.  It was back down to $1 quick.  In the end I had taken $2k and made a little over $39k in a matter of a few weeks.  I did this with many stocks over the course of 3 years and built up quite a nest egg.  Some is invested in property as well as other more fluid assets.

 I mean, it is not like I am totally stupid here.  I see the supply and demand increase.  But it is not like this increase happened suddenly.  And this sudden jump in price is nothing more than a gouge because they can.  

The real question we have to ask ourselves here it this.  What happens when/if the supply decreases?  It is likely to decrease going forward.  And then they will say that they need to increase prices due to limited supply.  Because the things they claim right now will be real at that point.  But we will already have the price increase in place.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is ZERO way I do not see this hitting the economy hard.  A huge issue for Bush was that he pushed for oil and gas price increases and getting more exports.  The more it costs to transport things, to travel, all that, the more things will cost.  Last time it ran milk up from $1.80 a gallon here to $3.99 and it never dropped below $2.70 post recession.  Even when gas had dropped back to a little under $2 a gallon at first.  

&amp;#x200B;

The one problem, different subject, is those stimulus things.  They helped at the time.  Yes, they created jobs by getting people spending and/or paying bills.  But we have not seen much in terms of wages.  Most here still make what they did pre-pandemic.  So future cost increases mean less buying power and less spending on many things.",2022-03-08T20:27:54

&amp;#x200B;

Phases 1, 2, 3 (a and b) are completed.  Phase 4 is was cancelled.  Phase 4 was a more direct and large pipeline to do more.

Phase 1 goes from Hardisty in Alberta Canada through Steele City and over into Illinois.  You can look it up.

Phase 2, completed in 2011, goes from Steele City to Cushing, OK.

Phase 3, completed in 2012, goes from Cushing to Port Arthur, TX.  That is the a part.  The b part was completed in 2016 and comes off of the a part and goes to Houston, TX.

&amp;#x200B;

That oil reaches the coast already.  Some goes inland.  Now, the XL portion was cancelled.  The XL portion was a larger pipeline that was to run from Hardisty Alberta Canada to Steele City, NE.  This was meant to a shorter more direct route with a larger diameter pipe.  Basically a capacity increase.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is certainly a complete pipeline.  I have family in TX and the west that worked on the early pipeline jobs.  Delivering materials and even engineering some of it.  Fact is, that phase 1 was complete, as stated, in 2010 and was delivering oil from Hardisty Alberta Canada to Steele City, Nebraska and ended in Patoka, Illinois.  This was in June 2010.  I can link you the information but it is readily available even through TransCanada.  It has the capacity to move 590k barrels a day to the midwest refineries.  The phase 3 I think can take 700k barrels a day to the coast.  I do not have the numbers handy for the what the XL was going to expand that up to.  But we certainly do have a pipeline.",2022-03-08T15:47:10

Encouraging oil production feeds the cycle and keeps everyone dependent on oil. When hostilities end, Russian gas will continue to flow to Europe and will be vulnerable to Russian hostility again.

45% of oil produced currently makes gasoline and 30% makes diesel, so maybe electric cars help there. But then you have enormous electrical demand.

If more people realized what a false economy oil executives are creating by refusing to open more leases or hire more crews, many of which are desperate for work, we would be burning corporate headquarters to the ground. They would much rather pad their pockets than to do what's right for the country. 

What's more is that we have huge reserves we could be using but they're choosing a wait and see approach rather than doing... wait for it... what's right for the country.

I'm not surprised at all by corporate greed, though I wish there were more that could be done about it, but when our own government is holding back on options that could help average Americans? That's a problem.",2022-03-01T20:15:55

But most Americans do not realize we subsidize oil and gas to the tune of $20 billion a year. In return oil companies pay $5 billion dollars in lease and royalties. This leaves $15 billion dollars before the 1st gallon of gas is sold at the pump. At the end oil and gas companies claimed a profit of $6 billion in the US last year. If these are true numbers which are easily found on the Internet then this is a losing situation but one we must continue for the short term. I do not question the loyalty patriotism of the hard-working men and women in the oil industry. I do however question the honesty of the leadership of these companies and the millions of dollars in political donations open and dark money. In other top oil producing countries gas sells for between .40 cents to a little over a dollar without subsidies from taxes. So with subsides in the US we are paying over 7 dollars a gallon!!

The GOP is doing the bidding of Big Oil, using the Ukraine crisis to push for more domestic oil and gas production.",mafco,764,2022-02-26T15:18:16,[deleted],1,"Number one, I agree with you in questioning the integrity of the heads of these corporations. But I don't limit that to the oil and gas industry.

The subsidies are really tax deferments for drilling and exploration costs and of the taxes they have to pay to foreign governments. It can be said that the exploration and production of oil and gas is a national security issue, and that partly justifies the tax deferments. The truth is that these companies pay more in total taxes than anyone else, but the effective rates are lower and they are incredibly profitable and don't need those breaks. So I get your point. The agricultural conglomerates take similar advantage of their political clout, as do Apple, Google etc. They're all using their influence to pay as little tax as possible. Crony capitalism at it's finest.",2022-02-27T16:35:14

I get your point, which I believe was to say the attempts by the Biden administration to limit drilling have been entirely ineffective and that these companies should be drilling more.

Yes right wing propaganda is a problem. That said, we wouldn't have ""news outlets"" like fox and oan if the [""aristocracy of our monied corporations""](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-10-02-0390) hadn't bought off politician to deregulate media markets to allow them to spread misinformation, own multiple TV, radio,  newspapers, without restriction...

For sure right wing propaganda has been what's caused or current rise of hate.  But the cause is that we let a few old money,  rich white dudes, with archaic and backwards ideology donate, seemingly unlimited funds, to put forth canidates they desire. Now am entire party is built on that.  

And the other party seems like they don't want to rock the boat on their cash cows, so that's just never pointed out by MSM. But remember Trump essentially bought his way into the presidency as he had the money to find his primary even without RNC funds... how America hadn't realized we are a full blown oligarchic, plutocratic, aristocracy that works for the upper 10% of wealth, not the bottom 90%. 

My point is, deregulation of media,  coupled with the rise of internet and social media (also not regulated due to our politicians being bought), have left us vulnerable to the rise of fascism.  But until we lock down the money in politics issues, they'll always be a way for some wealthy individual with crazy and dangerous views to be elected by simply buying access. Hell they don't need to even run themselves, as we can see if one greases enough wheels, one can just buy what they desire on the political front. 

Imho, it's money in politics, our system of ""legalized bribery"", that has allowed for this rot of fascistic beliefs to permeate. That's our problem, we can't have a democracy if its pay to play, and pay to play will lead us down this road we are already find ourselves on. When money buys you more speech than everyone else, that can be used for exactly what it has been used for,  indoctrination.",2022-02-25T13:11:36

Trump even started testing the waters for no term limits on presidents during rallies, and he received praise for it. There’s no doubt in my mind if trump stayed in office, we would look the other way, as a nation, to this invasion, under the guise of “he’s the only president that doesn’t start wars”. This was well orchestrated. MAGAs overlook the fact that trumps divisive antics, destroying americas camaraderie, we’re extremely beneficial to Russia (and all autocracies). Trump was overly confident in his second term, due to electioneering in 2016, but he was sloppy by shaming democrats for four years. This slop caused many to vote who generally never would.

It's an actual lose/lose for him. So he takes Ukraine? What does that do? Any government setup will have no recognition. nor will it be allowed at the UN. It's dead weight. and the people who stay aren't going to exactly be the most productive.

Russia's economy is already falling apart less than 1 day into this. Biden has yet to unveil the US sanctions either.

Q- ReporterA - Biden

**Q: Do you have any plans to talk to Putin? Will this be spiralling out of control?**A; It's a large conflict already, in particular with the Eastern Baltic states \[?\]. I have no plans to talk with Putin.  
**Q: Why have you not mentioned Swift - are allies not willing to use SWIFT as a sanction tool?**  
A: Our current sanctions will be hitting Putin hard enough. SWIFT is not an option that the rest of Europe wishes to take.

**Q: Sanctions is no. How and when will this end? Will he go beyond Ukraine? Is Putin threating Nuclear Strikes.**

A: (sigh) Nobody knows what he'll be doing, only what he's done. Nobody thought that the sanctions would prevent the War. He's testing our resolve..

**Q: Is Putin -**Biden ignores her

**Q: How painful will the sanctions get for American people.**

A: As long as we stand united and impose sanctions, we will \[didn't catch this\]

**Q: Would you still describe Putin as a worthy opponent? Would you still underestimate him?**

A: I never underestimated him, and I still think him a worthy adversary. Have you read his books? He has larger ambitions - he wants to re-establish the Soviet Union.

**Q: If Sanctions can't stop him, what can?**

A: Threat of sanctions and the effect of the sanctions are two different things. We will weaken his country so much, that he'll have to make a big decision.Sanctioning Putin is on the table.

**Q: Why not sanctioning Putin today?**

No answer given.

**Q: Respectfully, what more are you waiting for to use SWIFT as a sanction?**

A: Our current sanctions exceed SWIFT. Let's see if they are working.

**Q: Is there a complete rift in Russian/American Relationship/the beginning of a new Cold War?**

A: There is a complete rift in Russia/American relationship. About Cold War - we stand united. You don't see many people coming to this defense?

**Q: Should China also help to isolate Russia?**

A: Not prepared to comment on that on the moment.

**Q: Will you help if he moves to NATO country?**

A: Yes. If we don't stop him now with sanctions, he will be emboldened.

**Q: Is India fully in sync with you about RUssia?**

A: We are in consultation with India about that at the moment.",2022-02-24T19:10:53

1) of course a global super power causing mass uncertainty is going to drive up prices in food and gas and kill the market. That’s normal. 

2) the US and other countries don’t want to be responsible for sending their own troops to die to fight another countries war. They aren’t there yet, which we should be thankful for. The US shouldn’t be the world police. 

3) the threat of devastating Russia financially didn’t work. Now the action is to actually devastate Russia financially through the sanctions, but hurting the pockets of oligarchs and the children of oligarchs. Putin may become concerned as the elites in Russia turn against Putin because their pockets are being hurt. 

4) why not sanction Putin directly. Putin is so rich, he probably can’t even be touched. He is basically a god amongst men, the only thing he can lose is his loyal oligarchs. So you stab the oligarchs in the pocket and maybe Putin makes a correction.",2022-02-24T19:15:48

\---------------------------

Putin just started a war without justification.

He moved more than 160000 troops, equipment and blood banks to the border. This tells you all you need to know about his intentions.

**For weeks, we have been warning that this would happen.**

**Last week, we have seen shelling increased in the Donbass. More cyberattacks, a state theater in Moscow, declaring that Ukraine committed a genocide &amp; was ready to use chemical weapons without any justification, without any evidence**

At the very moment the UN was meeting to starting, Putin declared his war.

Then the missiles fell, the air raids, the tanks...

We have been transparent with the world, and declassified confidential information.

**Let me be clear - Putin is the Aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the costs.**

**I'm declaring new sanctions, designed for long-term impact on Russia and minimise impact on US&amp; allies. We are not doing this alone - More than 1/2 of the global economy (Au, Ja, Ger, ...) stand united in these sanctions. We will limit Russia's participation in the global economy, their ability to grow their economy, etc.**

**We have already seen the impact on the Russian Rubel, which early today hits its weakest limit ever. Today's actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks ($1.3 Trillion assets) and other banks - cut off the American system - their assets will be frozen.**

This includes VBT. We will also sanction oligarchs and their family members. They profited off the system, they will share the pain.

On Tuesday, we stopped Russia from getting money from European banks. Our sanctions will now target the Russian industry.

One of the most powerful impact will come over time. We will cut off over more than 1/2 of Russia's tech imports. We will hurt their ability in space, ships and compete economically.

We will hurt Putin's long-term ambitions for Russia.

**Tomorrow, we will convene NATO and confirm our unity and map the next steps. Our forces will not be engaged in conflict in Ukraine, but they will defend and assure our allies in the East. The United states will defend every inch of NATO territory. NATO is more united than ever. There's no doubt they will all meet the NATO 5 Article. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.**

I have authorised deployment of troops in Estonia, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and XX. Our allies have also stepped up and given provisions.

NATO came together and activated a response plan - we can deploy as and when to needed. I'm authorising an additional deployment to Germany - airforce troops (?). I have also discussed additional moves should they become necessary.

My government is doing everything to protect American families at the gas pump. Businesses should not exploit this to raise the prices. We are monitoring the prices of gas supply. We are working with other countries to ensure that the impact is minimal. US will be releasing additional barrels if warranted.

It's critical to me to me that American families will not be impacted.

But it would be much more if we let this agression continue.

**If Russia continues to pursue cyberattacks, we will respond.** We have taken all precautions and are prepared for Cyber attacks. We will provide Ukraine with relief &amp; tech to relieve their suffering.

..But the Ukrainians have known 30 years of independence, and they will not let their country be taken.

This is a dangerous moment for Europe. Now we all see what Putin and his allies are all about. This was never a security concern. It was always about changing is borders - a war without a cause.

**The US and its allies will emerge from this stronger, united and more purposeful. Putin's aggression will hurt Russia economically and ??. We will make sure of that.**

**Any country that stands with him will be stained by association.**

God bless the Free and Sovereign Ukraine.",2022-02-24T19:15:13

In their defense: 

For Biden - foreign policy/conflict is tricky (duh), and it can be tough to try to explain something within 30 seconds and then be shouted questions by dozens of other people at the same time.   

For Reporters - I think what they’re getting at is a even though these sanctions are going to be severe in some sense,  a lot of experts are talking about Putin having so much capital saved up where this won’t make too much of a dent in his immediate agenda.  And so perhaps they were pressing him a bit in that regard. 

That being said,  these reporters should better realize that the US President isn’t the world overlord that can simply snap his fingers and solve this all in a day.",2022-02-24T19:27:41

Putin claims not to care about sanctions but has also been begging for the sanctions that were placed after 2014 to be lifted. The Russian economy has been in a dire state for the last decade, civil unrest in Russia is reaching a boiling point, and the Russian military is a shell of what it was during the Cold War. 

New sanctions could absolutely cripple Russia, the Ukrainians are likely to resist Russia even if it means years of deadly insurrection for both sides, and short of starting a nuclear doomsday, Putin isn’t going to just walk into Poland, the Baltics, or any other NATO member state because the Russian military is far too weak. 

Putin isn’t doing any of this because all is well for him or Russia. This is a move of desperation, not one from a place of strength. Don’t just look at the events on the ground today.

The Russian economy will more than likely be in a recession by the next quarter. Their currency is going to be junk. They won't have the ability to buy foreign currency.

Putin and Russia are both cornered with no way out. They can't win the war they want. They can take Ukraine but any government will never be accepted as legitimate. Shit they can't even hold the country. Nor can they afford to keep their military deployed.

And as you mentioned the US will give aid to the Ukrainians who stayed behind and I'm sure the CIA is salivating at this opportunity.

The reality is this was Putin's Operation Barbarossa. This was Putin's Invading Russian during the Winter.

Could it have been better? Maybe. It was solid though. They're important moves to make that will very likely reduce the duration and impact of this action.

They have said out loud that they cannot win a traditional one on one war. They don't have the resources or funds to replace military units lost on the battlefield, wether that be tanks, jeeps, airplanes, drones, guns etc...so they need to work hard in the information game to confuse and cause chaos. 

That's EXACTLY what they've done. Personally I'd wager a large portion of pro putin posts on Facebook, tiktok, reddit etc...are post by Russian disinformation groups. It makes perfect sense and is Ocams Razor at its finest. 

They've caused massive fissure in social and cultural issues all across the US.  As an example thus nation was BUILT by immigrants, but the Trump says immigration is the largest problem we face. Then we have other leaders yelling at, arguing with, and insulting Americans with immigrant backgrounds even if they've served their country, are doctors, cops etc..so when the GOP stops immigration do you think it stops there? If you don't present as ""white"" they will be comming after you next. Those who think they're already here and safe, nope. 

Putin is finding common ground with Americans who feels the same way about non white peoples as putin and Russia does. It's disgusting.

We should be providing Ukrainian officials with resources and support to execute a scorched earth retreat policy, destroying food reserves that cannot be loaded out of the country.

Russia is short on food production and reserves, but Ukraine has a lot of grain.

Squeeze the Russian people and squeeze the oligarchs. If that doesn’t work, the next Bullet in the chamber is squeezing Putin. If that doesn’t work, completely destroy their import/export markets and go after their Allies with the same sanctions. If that doesn’t work, sanction their leaders. If that doesn’t work, do all of the above mobilize the might of the US military on their borders and make their citizens suffer even more. If that doesn’t work, we have crossed the rubicon.

There is still a lot of runway for us. What is impressive is that this first round, without all the other stuff, is devastating",2022-02-24T19:06:53

t0eppv,Biden to announce new measures in response to Russian invasion of Ukraine,CaliWilly76,456,2022-02-24T16:13:25,Cylinsier,7,Why do you think it didn't happen for four years?  Putin had no reason to rush to invade Ukraine before Trump was done destabilizing our European relationships.  You're talking four years of threatening to leave NATO and demanding help to rig an election from Ukraine in exchange for military aid.  It would have been poor judgment to invade and play his hand early when Trump was only making his position stronger as he waited.  Imagine if Trump had won reelection: he fully withdraws from NATO and Russia strolls in Kyiv without fear of US sanctions.  That was the preferred outcome.,2022-02-24T17:02:41

Russia actually started amassing troops on the Ukrainian border way back in March of 2021.  A little over a month after Biden was sworn in and the furor over January 6th had died down to the point that nothing was obviously going to come of it.  The announcement of intent to do this came in late February of 2021 from the Russian Defense Ministry.    
  
He waited long enough to be sure his puppet was truly ousted and not coming back, realized his hand in the game was as good as it was going to get, and started his buildup then.  So he didn't wait over a year, you just weren't following the story for over a year.  Which is fine, most people weren't.

We like to imagine that people are rational and make decisions based on evidence, but the reality is that we're usually irrational. We make decisions in the moment based on feelings, and only retain evidence that supports them, as a form of confirmation bias. Our memories can be altered by the phrasing of questioning and events around them, and when our beliefs are challenged, we don't compromise, but actually drift apart into more extreme opinions.

Trump's habit of telling different groups different things and keeping everyone arguing all of the time played perfectly to these flaws in our cognition, getting people to argue that Trump believes this or that, fighting every day into more extreme pro Trump positions, and failing to retain any evidence that doesn't support that.

It's just how the brain actually works. I'd recommend Democracy for Realists for a bunch of collected studies on these kinds of phenomena. It's important to note that the elite suffer all these same problems and make worse decisions overall than democracies, but that the idea of confronting someone who's wrong and changing their mind is little more than a fantasy. Confrontation always makes it worse, even if they believe something absurd, like that vaccines cause autism, or the world is secretly flat. And Trump mastered provoking confrontation.",2022-02-24T16:57:42

t033cr,Trump Runs to Fox News to Blame Russian Invasion on ‘Rigged Election’,Jozoman,485,2022-02-24T05:37:08,[deleted],1,"**How much impact could Putin and Russia have over Donald Trump?**  
  
Trump has long admired Russia and has not hidden his admiration of Vladimir Putin. Two of his 3 wives he has married are both native born, Russian speaking and raised in Russian.  
  
Donald Trump the businessman has pursued business deals in Russia since the early 1980’s and has traveled there to explore potential business deals.  
  
After serious failures for Trump in the 1990’s Trump suddenly reemerged back on the scene. Trumps properties were flush with money from Russian leases. Trump Tower had whole floors devoted to Russian tenants and the building reached a level of 43% Russian leases.  
  
  
  
In 2008 at the height of the real estate housing bubble burst and when the majority of real estate companies were seeing revenues plummeting Trump was awash in cash. Donald Jr. in a 2008 interview, said at a New York conference, ""In terms of high-end, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,"" he went on to say, “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia”. You would have to say that is a fair number of Russian connections to this point.  
  
Let’s focus a bit and look at just 6 month’s worth of time in Trumps life. A very “short” snippet of time that is available for all to look at or research. A small slice of history, but in that slice is revealed extensive correspondence, personal contact, organized meetings with Trump, The Trump campaign, Trump staff, Trump advisors, Trump companions and the Trump family with Russia’s highest levels.   
  
During the timeframe of May 2016 thru to November 2016 Trump and his associates had over 140 direct connections to Russian intelligence &amp; government officials. These contacts went unreported even though, such contacts are required by several laws. Contacts that purposely attempted to hide the contact and the conversations that transpired. Some contacts though weren’t even a little subtle.  
  
Everyone should be able to remember when, Trump while looking directly into a camera Infamously and openly asked Putin for a favor when he notoriously said, “Russia if your listening”. Trump Sr., explicitly pleaded Russia to hack Clinton’s emails. That should give us an idea of how comfortable Donald Trump was with Russia and bring into question how much contact with Russia he actually had.   
  
After that, Donnie Jr. held meetings with Russians where he was directly seeking information from them that could be used against Clinton, even though they were Russian operatives who were working on behalf of the Kremlin.  
  
It is established that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. They hacked into DNC party servers and finding emails that were actually written by Democratic individuals and members of the Clinton campaign. They then released those emails on website (Wikileaks) run Julian Assange just after the meeting with Donald Jr., at a critical time in the campaign to adversely affect Clinton and to bolster Trump.  
  
Prior to any American campaigning, Assange was indicted in America on 17 charges relating to the Espionage Act in the United States District Court. Under the Espionage Act charges Assange was facing a sentence of 170 years in prison. Assange was indited for his role in the publication of secret American documents on his website Wikileaks.  
  
Republican leaders and the conservative media figures had been demanding prison time (or worse) for Julian Assange for years. Suddenly, with Trump’s requests and the release of information that negatively impacted his Democratic opponent they were abruptly praising the Australian “anarchist”.   
  
From that request for Russian help, it has been established that LOTS of people in Trump’s circle had repeated contacts with Russians. These contacts lead to an investigation that resulted in dozens of criminal inditements. Inditements that had five of six of Trump closest advisers pleading guilty.  
  
The list of Trump associates who had contacts during just the six months in question is staggering and formidable. Below is a short list (but not all) of some of those who were close to Trump, who held key positions, some of who were indited and some who lied about contacts with Russians.  
  
•	Steve Bannon former campaign chief (Trump Pardoned)  
•	Paul Manafort Trump campaign chairman (Trump Pardoned)  
•	Rick Gates Deputy Trump campaign manager   
•	Rudy Giuliani Trumps personal advisor  
•	Michael Flynn Trump's National Security Adviser (Trump Pardoned)  
•	Jeff Sessions, Trumps first Attorney General,   
•	Donald Trump Jr.  
•	Sam Patten Republican donor operative  
•	Roger Stone campaign advisor (Trump Pardoned)  
•	Tom Barrack, the chairman of Trump's Inaugural Committee  
•	Alex van der Zwaan a lawyer with Manafort (the son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan George)  
•	George Papadopoulos Trumps foreign policy adviser, Michael Cohen Trumps personal attorney.   
  
Trump ran as the most pro-Russian candidate for president, He candidly admired Vladimir Putin’s manly virtues at every opportunity. Putin is a career KGB officer, who unambiguously hates America and has pursued the dismantling of NATO his entire career.   
  
Trumps visibly friendly relationship with Putin despite the numerous issues that came to light during Trumps Presidential term has had negative effects on the American psyche. According to a poll shows a shocking 49 percent of Republicans now consider Russia an ally. A nearly triple increase among Republicans in the last two years of Trumps term.",2022-02-24T19:30:17

By saying war is almost a certainty and that Putin intended to invade and takeover Kyiv (even if Putin doesn't seriously intend to do that), it puts Russia in a tricky position. And it has lots of upsides for Biden and the US.

Firstly,  it puts fear into other European nations, like Finland and Sweden who aren't a part of NATO. Finland for example just signed a 9 billion deal for fighter jets with the US. It will help push more weapons going into Poland and Romania. Biden has been under pressure by the military industry because he came out against the big arms deals with Saudi Arabia. So he needs to fill that gap somehow and Ukraine provides a great opportunity.

Secondly, just like Russia, US politics feeds off having a great enemy. It's what feeds the US military budget. After pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan the US military was in the weird position of not having a major conflict to contend with for the first time in 20 years. The re-emergence of Russia as the great enemy helps fill that void.

Thirdly, this strategy of playing up the likelihood of a Russian war of aggression helps Biden domestically. We know that many in the mainstream press have Russia aligned with Trump and many Republicans. So by hyping Russia as a great threat to Europe, to democracy, freedom etc, it helps Biden politically at home, as it can help counter the idea of Trump wanting to warm relations with Russia was a good thing.

Fourthly, it's in the US strategic interests to try and get Russia involved in a new costly conflict. If the US wants to undermine the Putin regime, they need new reasons to inflict punishing sanctions - and get the Europeans to join in. And if Russia gets into a costly war, that helps the US. The US won't get directly involved but can covertly feed the conflict with weapons, support etc. It's a low investment strategy with a good payoff as Russia and Ukraine bare the biggest costs. Ukrainians will likely be the biggest losers but so be it. The benefits for the US and Biden outweigh any collateral damage that might be inflicted on Ukraine.",2022-02-19T11:33:50

&gt;T*oday I made two vital calls on the Ukraine Crisis*  
&gt;  
&gt;*(1) with our congressional leaders*  
*(2) with heads of state of our Nato allies to bring them up to date to what the US thinks what's going to happen in Ukraine in the next days. We stand united with the allies.*  
  
&gt;  
&gt;*I share what we know about the rapidly developing situation in Ukraine.*  
*There's been a shelling of a kindergarten yesterday, misreported as being caused by the rebels. False reporting in Russian media about the Ukrainians ?? ...* (didn't catch this), *that the Ukrainians are committing a genocide.*  
&gt;  
&gt; *Do you really think that the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with 190000 soldiers at the border, to escalate the situation?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*All this behaviour is consistent with the playbook Russians have used before. False-flag operations.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*The Ukrainians have shown great restraint.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Russian troops have Ukraine surrounded, all around the border &amp; black sea.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*We have reasons to believer that Russia will attack Ukraine in the coming week or even days.We are calling out Russia with the hope to deter their plans.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***USA &amp; Allies prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. We will continue to provide resources to the Ukrainians - e.g.  javellins, loan guarantee to strengthen Ukrainian resilience. West is united to impose sanctions on Russia if the Ukraine is invaded.***   
&gt;  
&gt;***Russia can still choose diplomacy. Russia agreed that Labrov and US should meet on 24 February. If Russia takes action before this date, they will have chosen war and they will be sanctioned.***   
&gt;

I think what the commenter above you might really be getting at is that Putin's a bad apple and what we've done doesn't justify what he's doing.

What I'm arguing is less what the poster below put as ""Putin is a bad apple"" and more ""the fundamental ways in which states interact in the international system have not changed, despite a brief period in the 90s when the fall of the Soviet Union convinced some people in the west that they had."" The Fukuyama-esque ""end of history"" idea that the US was going to lead the world into a future of liberal IR-based democratic cooperation was always a fantasy.

Where Putin comes in specifically, the article seems to suggest that he bought into the potential for that future to exist and was disillusioned by the Iraq war. I'll concede that that's possible, but I think it's far likelier that Putin, a former KGB foreign intel officer, has held very realist, power-driven views of foreign policy his whole life. I don't think he needed to be shown ""how the world works in the 21st century,"" as the article says, because it's how the world has always worked and specifically lines up very well with how Soviet and Tsarist Russian foreign policy believed the world worked.

It seems far likelier to me that someone who came up in the environment Putin did was saying what Americans wanted to hear for a few years while he and his country were weak than that he truly had a brief conversion where he believed the best way forward was multilateral collaboration between liberal democracies. 

It's also not like he would have had to go back all that far to find other examples of America betraying the idea of itself as a proponent of freedom/a benevolent force internationally had Iraq not happened, he was alive and involved in Russian security during the Cold War where we committed all sorts of atrocities all over the world.",2022-02-19T13:46:02

And that's why NATO has been handling this so delicately. If it weren't for the threat of nuclear escalation, I imagine the rhetoric from Biden et al. would be much stronger, i.e., instead of ""We want diplomacy and we have sanctions if Russia invades"" to ""We're gonna kick your ass up to your shoulder blades, Red Forman style, if you come into Ukraine.""   


While I don't want to discount the causalities that would be faced on both sides, Russia would lose in a military intervention in Ukraine. The last thing a commander of an obsolete T-72 battalion would hear is the burp of an A-10's cannon or see a force of German Leopard 2's cresting the hill and that would be it.

Yanukovych was friendly to Russian gas lines, post 2014 that relationship was severed.  Russia wants its influence back and to project its strength into Europe.

&gt;The United States and our Allies and partners around the world are ready to impose powerful sanctions on \[and\] export controls, including actions that did not — we did not pursue when Russia invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014.  We will put intense pressure on their largest and most significant financial institutions and key industries.  
&gt;  
&gt;These measures are ready to go as soon and if Russia moves.  We’ll impose long-term consequences that will undermine Russia’s ability to compete economically and strategically.  
&gt;  
&gt;And when it comes to Nord Stream 2, the pipeline that would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany, if Russia further invades Ukraine, it will not happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;**While I will not send American servicemen to fight Russia in Ukraine, we have supplied the Ukrainian military with equipment to help them defend themselves.  We have provided training and advice and intelligence for the same purpose.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**And make no mistake: The United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power.  An attack against one NATO country is an attack against all of us.  And the United States commitment to Article 5 is sacrosanct.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Already, in response to Russia’s build-up of troops, I have sent additional U.S. forces to bolster NATO’s eastern flank.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Several of our Allies have also announced they’ll add forces and capabilities to ensure deterrence and defense along NATO’s eastern flank.**  
&gt;  
&gt;We will also continue to conduct military exercises with our Allies and partners to enhance defensive readiness.  
&gt;  
&gt;And if Russia invades, we will take further steps to reinforce our presence in NATO, reassure for our Allies, and deter further aggression.  
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt;And if Russia attacks the United States or our Allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re moving in lockstep with our NATO Allies and partners to deepen our collective defense against threats in cyberspace.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, at the Munich Security Conferenec, German defense minister Baerbock said on sanctions:

&gt;These sanctions are – or would be unprecedented and have been coordinated with all our partners and have been prepared with them.  **We in Germany are ready to pay a high price for that in economic terms. That is why all options are on the table – also Nord Stream 2.  (Applause.)**

His northern ports are pretty much inaccessible in Winter due to icing so he needed other options.

Seizing Sevastopol was one. The Syrians gave him a temporary port in return for fighting the rebels and ISIS. And he tried to incite a revolt in Moldova to get another (most likely Port of Bar).

But his access to Sevastopol is via one bridge (bridges can blow up) and Ukraine stopped sending water to Crimea so he was on shaky ground.

If he can seize the east of Ukraine, he can have a land corridor to Sevastopol. And maybe that way people stop laughing at Russian navy.",2022-02-18T21:19:11

I don't think that he'll do it because then Germany definitely stops buying his gas and is 100% in line with the US. Right now, his best chance at fracturing NATO is by making the US promise that they'll kill that pipeline and having it either not be killed due to Germany moving out of step with the US or it being killed and the German people blaming the US for rising energy prices. The people in the US will then blame Biden for higher energy prices, and Trump will win in 2024... though that is honestly the most likely outcome of the election anyway, and it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out/would play out with Trump at the wheel.

Russia was totally planning on invading Ukraine on Wednesday but because the US said they were gonna do it they decided to actually do it a week later. That'll show those Americans! They'll be completely unprepared now... I don't mean to be an asshole, but have you considered the possibility that the US lied and knew they could do that because there'd be zero consequences? 

If you truly remember US's transgressions in the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America, then you'd also remember that this exact situation we're in right now has happened many, many times before and it would be foolish to trust the US government's word on this without a shred of proof. They're not even showing any journalists anything... 

I'm not trying to say that Russia hasn't lied and can't/won't lie again, by the way. I just think that Russia's plan here is obvious with or without US state propaganda. It's obvious that Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine, it's in their best interest for Ukraine to stay independent (""independent,"" but heavily influenced by Russia of course). They need an ""independent"" buffer state between them and NATO. Invading Ukraine and starting a war would do the opposite. 

Furthermore, we know how many troops Russia has on the border.

I didn't really give a well-thought-out answer there as I was mostly just trying to make the point that I think it's ridiculous to normalize letting the US government start wars without showing any kind of evidence at all.

It's worth noting that the separatists have been doing this since at least Crimea. Nothing has changed. Our US-funded neo-nazis have been doing similar things by the way. That's where Putin got the whole ""Ukraine is going to genocide ethnic Russians"" thing from, the US-funded neo-nazis have been claiming that they're going to do that exact thing since Crimea. 

Not saying that Putin's statement is valid of course. Like I said, the neo-nazis have been saying this since 2014 and as far as I know nothing has happened.

Trump was like driving a fleet of gas tankers into a political dumpster fire.

The Jan 6th insurrection and the conspiracy that created it is closing in and it's far deeper than we ever feared. Some Republicans are going for the ""Let's condemn it so we can pretend it didn't happen!"" and the others who almost definitely were directly involved are going all in on destroying America in the hopes of seizing power.

As such -- we're staring down the barrel at WW3 (and as above -- a possible nuclear one), a civil war against American fascists (IMO the trucker convoy shutdowns and resulting response will be the catalyst, RU assets like Rand Paul are calling for them for a reason), and all of this against a backdrop of a anti-vaxxer-prolonged pandemic and conservative-driven-cataclysmic global warming.

FFS at least the people who endured WW1 and the Spanish Flu got the roaring 20s. Sure that had prohibition and ended in a market crash but they had 10 years of good times post-pandemic.

Because Biden has deployed a small contingent of 3,000 troops to the area. The point of this token force to face 100,000 Russians, is that they are expendable. They form a line which Putin will not cross. If he decides to invade. He will take part of Ukraine, but will stop short of engaging Americans. Because if Americans die, there will be calls for action to avenge the deaths. The real question is, why doesn't the rest of Europe seem to be concerned about the situation?",2022-02-12T07:48:21

&gt; Earlier Friday, Biden held a call with transatlantic leaders to chart next moves as talks over Russia&amp;#039;s military build-up near Ukraine showed no sign of defusing the crisis.

&gt; European leaders have engaged in intense diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine over the past several weeks to avoid war in eastern Europe.

&gt; Senior U.S. officials say they do not believe Russia&amp;#039;s President Vladimir Putin has made a decision whether to invade Ukraine, even as he has amassed over 100,000 troops on Russia&amp;#039;s border with Ukraine.

The meme of every US politician being right-wing in Europe is simply false. People like to point out the social programs, but many of those were already in place as the nation's governments formed and would be terribly unpopular to remove. But that hasn't necessarily prevented the right-wing part of the government from using the same tactics we see our right-wing using to chip away at them, such as some European countries are seeing their universities beginning to implement tuition fees.

Though, we can also see a xenophobic sledgehammer being swung with things like Brexit. Imagine: completely destroying your economy and your trade deals because you don't want immigrants taking your jobs. That was seriously one of the biggest reasons for it, a fear of ~~Mexican~~ Polish immigrants taking the jobs of hardworking ~~Americans~~ Britons.

Just look at Switzerland, low taxes, high healthcare costs, and compulsory private insurance that will cost over 250 euros per month for the most basic coverage.

You have Greece, which has so much government corruption that it is collapsing into itself with bribery being a way of life.

Sure, there are some left-wing and some right-wing leaning countries. But then there are countries whose current leading parties are modeled after the US Republican party.

The myth was something that has been spread for decades by edgy anti-authorty teens who listen to Morrissey and think everyone else is blind to the reality of the world. And with Eurocentrism, the countries there have a long history of thinking of themselves as the most important and righteous people in the world, so of course they will push the myth too. Plus, anti-Americanism, while at times warranted, is prevalent among many ideologies.

The fact of the matter is that all countries have good and bad in them. So, you'll have governments who will do the wrong thing for what they believe are the right reasons.",2022-02-12T02:33:56

Why would you do something that costs a billion dollars in order to make your opponents just spend a million dollars? The build-up is much more expensive for Russia than NATO. It's not like NATO is laying out the kind of resources necessary for invading a neighboring country.

&gt;If there is going to be a war with Russia, it will be waged at the border of Ukraine, so why wouldn't they train on that terrain?

You do understand that military analysts can tell the difference between a mobilization operation and training, right?

&gt;Whatever the case, I think that NATO should consider Russia's forces that are occupying Crimea as at war with Ukraine and also consider the troops at the border and the naval vessels as at war. I think the West should demand the retreat from Crimea, and if they don't leave, the Russian navy should be taken out. If they still don't leave, the troops at the border should be shelled, and if they still don't leave, the liberation of Crimea should begin

If you're hanging your theory on the notion that western intelligence agencies are just misreading a big training operation then sorry but that's ridiculous. They're moving naval assets to blockade the country as well. Is that a training operation too? Countries know how to conduct training operations that are not misread as invasions, which is why you don't constantly hear about nations freaking out that they think they're about to be invaded due to their neighbor conducting an exercise (save for NK's histrionics)

There would be alerts about US warplanes headed for the border and then nothing would happen.

His take on it was ""This is how you mentally exhaust your enemy.  You mobilize and head for the border...and then you stop.  You mobilize and head for the border...and then you stop. You mobilize and head for the border...and then you stop. You mobilize and head for the border...and then you stop. You mobilize and head for the border...and then you stop.""

Your opponent has a very hard time not being lulled into assuming you won't really attack.

And that's when you mobilize and head for the border...and then you it hard.

For those of us who were paying attention, late last year Putin put 100,000 troops at the border and then pulled them back.

The longer answer: Trump was Russia's stooge.  Putin had him in his pocket.  It is extremely likely that Trump shared secrets and other compromising intelligence with Putin.  Trump also put the US into disarray.  The time to have a confrontation with the US is now, before it has more time to regain its balance.

The longer and more speculative answer: Vladimir is getting old.  He doesn't have a lot of time left.  I would argue that this is his last hurrah, and I think he still dreams of reuniting the Soviet Union.  Russia is armed to the teeth but is not doing well economically.  Having all the resources of the other former Soviet countries would help a lot.  Having lived in one and visited several, how much potential support Putin has could be surprising to outsiders.

lol - no.
This was going on long before then. Ukraine asked to join the EU and NATO (in 2013/14) because they were sick and tired of being under Russia's thumb, economically, and culturally. 

And it's not a buffer zone, Russia wants.  Russia wants to take other people's shit, and not pay.  The Russians living in Donbas are proof of that.

At that point, the US would never have been able to position enough troops quickly enough to repel a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Even if the US had engaged all NATO countries to join the US effort, there still never would have been enough troops. 

The only realistic deterrence would be if Ukraine had been a NATO member and NATO troops deployed inside Ukraine as a “trip wire”. The trouble with that is it probably would have ensured Russian invasion before the Ukraine military could have  fully integrated within NATO and the “trip wire” engaged.

The only recourse was, and still is, “deterrence by punishment”, or in layman’s terms, sanctions.

EDIT: Putin’s timing is very suspect. 

He knew that he would never have a confrontation with Trump as POTUS, so he started the buildup right after Trump lost the election. It’s almost as if Putin is looking for a confrontation and nothing more since he could have rolled into Ukraine when Trump was POTUS with no meaningful objection from at least one of the major NATO powers. IMHO NATO has a new Chancellor in Germany, an embattled MP in the UK, a new POTUS in the US, and Brexit causing rifts in the EU, so Putin is just testing NATO resolve.",2022-01-27T20:16:15

Russia isn't going to base their actions on the debatable interpretations of ad-libbed statements at a press conference. It makes no difference in what they choose and how the US will react.

&gt; &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve been absolutely clear with President Putin. He has no misunderstanding. If any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border, that is an invasion,&amp;quot; Biden said at the outset of an event on infrastructure.

&gt; While the president later in the press conference sought to clarify he was suggesting any response would require unity among NATO allies, White House aides have spent the hours since Biden made the comments trying to tamp down concerns about whether Biden was giving Putin a green light for some sort of lesser action toward Ukraine.

&gt; The confusion came at an inopportune time for the Biden administration, with Secretary of State preparing to meet with his Russian counterpart in Geneva later this week.

No, he isn't. If Russia successfully invaded all of Ukraine it would be a large scale invasion. If he invaded a single village and leave after a strong defense it would be minor incursion. They would both be awful and should be something people consider unacceptable either way but one is minor when compared against other possibilities.

&gt; WASHINGTON - Ukraine&amp;#039;s president appeared to rebuke President Joe Biden Thursday after Biden suggested that a &amp;quot;Minor incursion&amp;quot; by Russia into Ukraine would not merit a strong international response.

&gt; &amp;quot;We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations,&amp;quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote in a tweet posted Thursday morning.

&gt; During a news conference Wednesday, Biden vowed to impose &amp;quot;Severe economic consequences&amp;quot; should Russian President Vladimir Putin decide to invade the eastern European country.

Today the Ukrainian forces are larger, bolstered by modern weapons from western countries, and have been training since Crimea for what they felt was an inevitable Russian invasion. Crimea being annexed was considered a huge slap in the face to the Ukrainian people and it caused a wave of anti Russian sentiment. So the Ukrainian people aren’t likely to just roll over like Crimea and the army will be fighting on their soil for their freedom. What we don’t know is how many Ukrainian politicians and powerful people or even military leaders are in bed with Russia. The Ukraine government has a history of corruption and those in power lining their own pockets despite the people. How many of them are still in positions of power and how many Putin has bought off will be a large deciding factor on how easy an invasion will go. If Russia doesn’t have the cards in place to take Ukraine swiftly and with relative ease and instead has to fight a bloody war that turns them into an occupying force it will become a drastically expensive endeavor that far outweighs the gains for Russia. Russia may have a relatively large military but their economy isn’t even in the top ten. If they invade they can weather the sanctions to come, but if the fighting continues it will bleed Russia out. We may yet be in the brinksmanship phase of this with Russian troops crossing into Ukraine as the final we will do it but not pushing far enough to engage the Ukrainian forces allowing a last minute deal, but it likely all comes down to what assets Russia controls in the Ukrainian government and that is hard to speculate on.",2022-01-20T03:21:02

Well, I assume that a litmus test of sorts can be utilized for that. 

For example I think a piece that advocates on behalf of a group should be safe. Right now we have many things masquerading as this but they are really hit pieces. If you read a pro [something] article it will start off with shitting on some opposition's perspective and stick to it. 

I also think that points of origin should be mandatory on such things, content posted for public consumption should not have its source obscured. 

Frankly I think the social media companies can solve the problem by basically banning all political posts and promotion. 

For example, if Facebook had never allowed you to buy targeted adverts with collected data, this strategy would never have worked as effectively. 

Social media companies need to be put to task for this. When we interact with social media there is an unspoken expectation that we are interacting with each other, the general public. If someone called your house impersonating a close friend and selling you something, that would be akin to fraud...but on social media that is okay. If someone were to give away your personal information it is identity theft, but if it is used for advertising on social media they don't have any such liability. 

Social media is really the problem, much as I hate to say that as a person who finds the smaller world tech has given us to be a wonderful thing. ",2017-10-17T18:00:58

Doesn't this type of freedom necessarily lead to a tyranny of the strong over the weak and the unjust over the just? And as history unfolded from this pre-history freedom, did not power accumulate into the hands of the kings and queens? And did this not necessitate our own birth of freedom in the time of enlightenment, where all men were realized to be equal? Would we be so foolish as to repeat this cycle, and not protect ourselves from the the barbaric ways the powerful accumulate wealth, until no man is ever born equal to those who are born in the elite classes?

In the present day's so called free world we've become cynical about freedom and use it as cover for our one true ideal - profit. With our real world president who became famous as the reality TV version of Gordon Gecko and defeated his political opponents through bullying and outrageous lies, I don't think the universe could send that message any more clearly. We need freedom from tyranny, not the freedom to tyrannize. We need to connect and help one another, not recede further into the individual self.

The problem, as people are realizing, is that simply protesting is not enough. Something more must happen. The protest is because a situation is so untenable that people abandon their jobs for a day to take to the streets. But then, as a result of protest, their either needs to be an end to the untenable situation or a compromise.

What we have is a situation where one party is completely in control of the government and their ideologically opposed brethren protest, but the ruling party's constituency largely doesn't care because they're in control. When things get to a dangerous point, select Congressional Republicans apply a pressure release (like saying Marino is not acceptable after the 60 Minutes/WaPo report or voting against the ACA repeal) to appease *their* base before things get out of hand.

As a result, the Republican constituency sees their legislators making compromise, but liberals/Democrats continuing to protest because. A perception is created that Democrats will protest no matter what, so why bother ever conceding anything. This, interestingly, is like what happened with the Tea Party and Congress when Obama was President, with one important difference: Democrats repeatedly came to the table to negotiate when Republican constituents would protest. However, due to Norquist and McConnell's active campaign to oppose Obama no matter the cost, Republicans would always vote no, even when the compromise was in their favor, with select exceptions as a pressure valve. In conservative news, this was portrayed as a refusal by liberals to compromise. This led to the disastrous 2010 election, capture of government by Republicans, and the current state of affairs.

It all boils down to control of perception. It's very clever if you ignore that they're hurting America. ",2017-10-17T14:11:30

But we need to GTFO ASAP, if we want our country back. 



But sadly the net is a wonderful comfortable bubble that reflects each and every one of us. (Your collection of ads and curated media experiences are seen *only by you*, and the same is true of the most die hard right winger). 

Meanwhile the corporations are getting more and more powerful. 


So the only way to stop it is *people power*. So let’s get uncomfortable. ",2017-10-17T15:20:38

One of the speakers touched on the concept of Triangulation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(social_science). It kind of struck me that the lack of this is something that could, at least in part, explain the right/left divide when it comes to susceptibility to fake news.

The ""fake news"" attacks from the GOP and others on the right, as well as state actors like Russia, on those sources seeks to weaken the usefulness of Triangulation on their target populations, which only makes it easier and easier to deceive and manipulate those folks.

For one, the server was literally *completely unsecured* for months after being setup. Boom. Doxed.

For another, even when it was ""secured"", vulnerable services were left exposed to the whole world that any script kiddy with metasploit could root in minutes. Boom. Doxed. 

For another, the domain was clintonemail.com FFS. There's a number of [services](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/newly-registered-domains.php?gclid=CJDYroSrgM0CFQKTaQod3-UCPg) that let you pull feeds of registered domain names so as soon as that one was registered, it would have got the attention of at least some people keeping an eye on those feeds.

Clinton not only handed those communications to any third party that wanted them through the use of a private server, that she requested making her culpable, but as a result if she were to reach the White House without an indictment she's now going to be stuck giving favors to everyone who comes out of the woodwork to blackmail her with the contents. 

This is a huge deal, and anyone who says otherwise very likely has a very limited understanding of technology and how the internet works. Every one of these communications passed over the open web.

Viktor Yanukovych (former pro-Russian President) was democratically elected. For decades there was status quo and even pro-Western governments of Ukraine wasn't anti-Russian. One reason was because Ukraine itself have big Russian population and radical anti-Russian agenda is suicidal for country  integrity. Yanukovych was elected as response for former President pro-Western policy. Also, there was already tension between pro-Russian and anti-Russian population. So every President of Ukraine tried to avoid tension on this hot political theme, because it's for sure would lead to civil war. After radical anti-Russian coup actual civil war was started and Russia undoubtedly starts to support pro-Russian forces and USA starts to support anti-Russian forces. All this essentially became proxy war between Russia and USA! And all of that started just because balance was shifted by USA intervention. It's why I called it ""extreme incompetency of USA foreign policy"". USA shouldn't pull any strings at all. There was already frozen conflict which have its roots in WW2 history. At WW2 there historically was support for Nazis in Ukraine and Ukraine was one of historical hosts of Holocaust.

Our security does little to nothing to protect us from those threats currently, so the fact that we have not been attacked in such a way for over 10 years indicates we are not in danger.

The TSA has become an arm of the drug war, that is their primary (though secret) objective. I wouldn't be surprised if they want to use this technology in cop cars in 10 years, so the cop can effectively search your vehicle before pulling you over.",2012-07-13T22:49:39

But regardless, if it is done right, the law could be written to make such discoveries inadmissible in a court of law and therefore negate the possibility of searches.

As I have said numerous times wrt the drones over the US, a single unconstitutional use of a law does not make the law itself constitutional if there are constitutional uses. It can be restricted by the government or the courts to specific uses and any other uses will be fatal to any cases brought using the evidence.",2012-07-13T23:01:20

They would want such discoveries to be admissible in court.

We can hope the supreme court would say something about it, but they haven't so far with the TSA scanners, which I consider pretty fucking bad.  All they catch is people with small amounts of drugs, and people who forgot to put their nail clippers in their checked luggage.",2012-07-13T23:03:46

I have taken small amounts of marijuana through the screening many times (more than 12 round trips), and have never been caught.  So they aren't very good at it, but it still annoys me.  This technology could make them better.

technologies by **avoiding the requirement of a
spectrometer**. Since all the parameters of the system
are electronically controlled, including the wavelength
and repetition rate, it is possible to determine the
originating output wavelength from the pulse rate of the
received signal. Moreover, with the fast tuning capability,
or the sweep function of the synchronized laser system,
the frequency information and associated wavenumber
can be determined while sweeping. Benefits of not
requiring a spectrometer include cost reduction and
the ability to position multiple detectors in different
locations to capture scattered light for a more complete
capture of the target’s chemical composition.",2012-10-02T21:40:27
