Based on which Ukraine gave up it's nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia, which were later obviously violated?

Portraits with the words “Hero of Russia”. Posters of troops with Kalashnikov rifles encouraging the public to “Love, be proud of and defend” Russia.\nIn other words, to sign up and go and fight in Ukraine. Three years after its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Russia is seeking new recruits.\nDespite all the military imagery around town, if you live in Tver it’s possible to convince yourself that life is normal. The front line is hundreds of miles away.\n\n\n“Just look around,” Mikhail, a local teacher, tells me. “Cars are passing by and all the shops are open. No shells are falling from anywhere. We are not panicking. We can’t hear any sirens wailing. We do not run to any evacuation points.”\nFor many Russians their invasion of Ukraine – what the Kremlin still calls a “special military operation” – is something they only encounter on their TV screens.\nBut for people like Anna, it’s much more real.\nAnna and her daughter\nImage caption, Some people Anna knew never came back from fighting in Ukraine\n“I know a lot of people who went off to fight,” Anna says when we get chatting on the street.\n“Some of them never came home. I hope [the war] ends as soon as possible.”\nDonald Trump claims that’s what he wants, too. Without inviting Ukraine to the negotiating table, the Trump administration has already entered direct talks with the Russian leadership.\nWhat do Russians make of the US president and his overtures to Moscow?\n“Trump is a dark horse,” believes Anna. “I’m not sure what to expect from him.”",

The Ukrainian capital was in a tight security lockdown with car traffic halted and even pedestrians blocked from certain streets. Shortly afterward, an air raid siren went off in the city.\n\n&gt; Biden has insisted the U.S. will continue to back Ukraine for “as long as it takes” despite flagging support among the American public and no near-term prospect of peace talks to end the conflict.\n\n&gt; The Biden administration has provided some $30 billion in security aid since President Vladimir Putin sent Russian forces into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, initiating the largest ground war in Europe since World War II — one that already has cost his country and Ukraine hundreds of thousands of casualties.\n\n&gt; Under Biden’s leadership, the U.S. and its NATO allies have gradually expanding the array of weaponry they have pledged to include heavy tanks.\n\n&gt; While other world leaders have visited Kyiv to meet with Zelensky over the past year, and tour the war-scarred city, Biden has stayed away due to security concerns and fears about the possibility of conflict between the world’s two largest nuclear powers, sending senior aides in his place. First Lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Western Ukraine on Mother’s Day in May.\n\n&gt; His visit was shrouded in secrecy.

Who does he think he is, stealing our money?!\n\nThen... he AIRED THE CLIP. Huge mistake. I've no idea who in the newsroom allowed that to happen, because the clip instantly contradicted what Tucker just said. Now, I know most viewers won't notice because they can only understand what Tucker tells them to think. But I was sort of dumbfounded.\n\nA few minutes later, proud bigot and anti-civil-rights pro-terrorism propagandist Glenn Greenwald sleezes his way on screen and spends a few minutes oozing a word salad about how Putin is right to kill ethnic minorities and try to take over the Orthodox church through puppet proxies to control religion in Ukraine.\n\nNone of it really made sense, and Greenwald came very close to explicitly advocating for Putin seeking out a final solution to the Ukraine problem. So they cut to footage of the chaos in El Paso where the invading brown vermin are climbing over border walls (with footage showing how easy it is to climb; only a total moron would rely on just a wall to keep out migrants) and pretended the speech never happened. \n\nAnd then Tulsi Gabbard showed up with concerns that immigrants might not be immediately imprisoned or incinerated or something.\n\nNot that any of that matters. But through my disgust I found it encouraging that even Fox News and Tucker Carlson aren't willing to spend a lot of time on the subject. By drawing attention, it creates awareness, and the morality is so clear on the most cursory consideration that creating awareness is VERY bad for their Putin-ordered messaging.",

The LONGEST war in US history. \n\nFinally passed the violence against women act. \n\nThe American rescue plan act. Which helped get the schools/businesses running again post pandemic. \n\nI'm skipping over EO's but add those in and you get to add student loan forgiveness. \n\nEconomically, we're in a hyper inflation mode (which sucks) due directly due to pandemic responses from 2019-2021. BUT we are also at record lows for unemployment, record highs for wages, and record high for jobs available. \n\nImmigration we are record levels of drug seizures, stopped illegal immigrants, and funding/support for the various border organizations (I'll expand on why this is happening below so keep your panties out of a bind)*\n\nInternationally: He stopped Russia dead in its tracks by uniting NATO and basically every democracy on the planet to cause them to likely lose Crimea and they are risking losses from past invasions due to Biden's actions. Basically Russia never thought the \"West\" could put a unified front up. Biden, and ~3-4 big leaders did that. This also has reverberated through the world and set a clear precedent that China is FUCKED if it steps out of line (granted they are masters of moving the line). \n\n*Now to the immigration one, because this is BY FAR my favorite item to talk about. Trump did it, not Biden. BUT Trump can't claim it due to it highlights his broken policies. Basically, the first wave of wall funding didn't go to building a wall, it went to upgrading checkpoints, upgrading roads/supports to them, and basically building out EXISTING locations that would enable border security and safety. He hated that. The only funding he received for the wall, built ZERO wall. He later attempted to reappropiate funding to build an actual wall and it failed. His buddies also are likely headed to jail for using the lack of a wall to steal from Americans. \n\nBUT it gets better! Trump didn't get the funding for the wall BECAUSE none of the border security groups asked for it OR thought it would remotely work. The \"new wall\" that did get built is ALREADY FALLEN cut or basically trash. FURTHER, Trump failed to fill most of the critical appointments within DHS, INS, Border Patrol, and several other orgs. Instead relying on temporary or vacant seats. \n\nSO Biden got to walk in, get fully upgraded equipment and staff, and all he had to do was put competent people in their roles. (Of note, most of those appointments actually pissed off his base as shockingly they were GOP lifers for the most part (ironically most are now RINO's per the group).\n\nDudes been solid. Depending on 22 he's going to end up mid tier in overall POTUS rankings. He's not going to end up top 10. BUT if he can keep things rolling as a democracy until 2028 (back to the other sides biggest issue IMO) he'll be ok.",

It's a non-binding resolution - the fact that it doesn't do anything is literally in the name of what it is.\n\nExcept it objectively does help Ukraine like I have mentioned before.\n\n\n&gt;No, it takes more effort, and it has more effect. It's the difference between visiting a friend versus sending a postcard. You can't pretend it's the same thing.\n\n\nAgain, that comparison is not a valid one.\n\n&gt;I have, and they didn't say any of that shit\n\nThey have. If you like, I can provide articles about it but it’s easy to find.\n\n\n&gt;Gosar said the resolution could be perceived as an endorsement of Ukraine to NATO leading to direct war with Russia, and we have our own border issues to face. Others said it effectively called for direct US involvement, including boots on the ground, and that's a bridge too far for them. I find those reasons stupid, when you could just say \"this does nothing, it's just a non-binding resolution saying nice words when it could be a bill taking useful action\".\n\nDo you know what the word “include” means? It’s not limited to the reason I stated. Those reasons are objectively invalid. Still, voting against a resolution regardless of its effective or not is significant.\n\n&gt;Of course, the GOP has introduced measures that actually do take useful action, such as Lindsay Graham's measure to back Ukraine in international Court against Putin's war crimes.\n\nAnd many republicans still have done things that have gone against Ukraine including Trump. \n\n&gt;Graham's co-sponsor in that? Victoria Spartz, one of the two GOP members of Congress who went to Ukraine.\n\nAnd when she went, did she bring any weapons, etc? No\n\nIn the end, you claim about “GOP showing how it’s done” is not one based in reality as shown in my replies and elsewhere",

In a way, he kind of got lucky that so much focus is being paid to foreign policy so far.\n\nEven with Afghanistan, everyone points to that as some disaster. And to a degree it was, and it baffles me how the Intel community did not predict the speed and easy with which the Taliban would take over. I think that has more to do with the Intel community on that, but the the buck does always stop with the President. That being said, even with that massive fuck up, Biden and his team were able to orchestrate a pretty amazing rescue operation on the fly with very little time to plan for it. And yes there was unfortunately one suicide bomb that went off and killed 13 US Service members and some civilians, but I feel like i’m taking crazy pills when people point that one incident out as some massive fuck up. Did everyone forget how many suicide bombs and other guerrilla warfare attacks had happened in Afghanistan over the past 20 years? The fact that there was ONLY one that occurred during that chaotic time is a blessing.\n\nI don’t know who is to blame for the initial intelligence failure that led to the Taliban sweeping across the entire country in a matter of hours rather than weeks or months, but everything outside of that was handled pretty amazingly in retrospect. The number of people we were able to evacuate in such a short amount of time was unbelievable from a logistics point of view.",

And their offspring and relatives hear those biases and further pervert it. \n\nFor instance this is one thing I hear a ton of. \"god said that no homosexual would ever be allowed to enter the kingdom of heaven\". There is so much wrong with that it's not even funny. Trying to debate any part of that is just met with a brick wall of denialism. I have even gone so far as to say I will bet you $1,000 right now that you can't find that written anywhere in the bible. Same with for some reason they kept saying that Patrisse Cullors was arrested by the FBI, and something along the lines of her saying something is racist and the FBI said no ma'am this is stealing. Quite a few of those thousand dollar bets are out there, but oddly they never try to collect. \n\n&gt;then that Jesus probably was murdered by some redneck while trying to cross the Rio Grande into Texas.\n\nI think it would be closer to a drone strike or something like that.",

Yes I am generalizing a bit, but it holds true for a lot of people I have met. I find that they go to church to wash away the sins so to speak. They can do whatever they want, so long as they put some money in the collection plate, they have secured their seat in heaven. When I was \"saved\" I remember a lot of talk about going to church and all that was to bring you closer to god, and basically make it so you sin less? It's been a while so I may be slightly off with my memory. But looking around at the people who have been \"with god\" the longest... didn't look like it was working for them, and they weren't magically better people. \n\nI try to help those that I can because I think it's the right thing to do. I don't try to help someone and take a selfie for god saying hey, keep my seat warm, look at all the good I am doing... Then brag about every small thing you do for someone. \n\nTo be perfectly honest I think a lot more people without faith are more christ like than actual christians.",

In fact, I implied that despite Trump's criminal betrayal towards them religion and conservative values would win out and they'd likely vote fairly neutrally.\n\nBesides, other than abortion and other strictly moral/ethical/religious policies, Ukrainians themselves are pretty liberal on the US spectrum of politics. Socialized, universal healthcare is guaranteed to citizens of Ukraine, on paper. In practice, this doesn't reach most segments of the population. However, pre-war, that was being improved by FURTHER socialization and government funding rather than privatization or defunding. Ukraine spends a relatively high percent of GDP on social safety nets that, when fully funded under the USSR eclipsed the US's current programs. These safety nets were being reformed by INCREASING budgets for them (though these reforms admittedly came with decentralization, which is a more conservative viewpoint in the US). \n\nMy point isn't that Ukrainians will vote super blue, it's that they probably wouldn't vote super red, either.",

NATO refused to give Russia assurances which ones were and weren't allowed to be considered, because that's pretty much a shitty deal for any of the shrinking list of countries who are near Russia that haven't been invaded yet. \n\nUkraine 'went too far' by electing leaders not aligned with Russia. Russia is claiming to \"denazify\" Ukraine. Hurt feewings about a NATO alliance that is uninterested in expansion and that fact is widely known is a poor rationale for invasion, especially since Russia pretty much invaded the place 8 years ago and never left. The Ukrainians knew NATO wasn't wading into that situation. They have played their hand incredibly well thus far, almost as if they knew that appealing to the world and to their own people was the play they had, and weren't relying on NATO.",

Problem is, Putin declared that 'denazification' was the reason for the invasion, and NATO status was irrelevant. Not to mention that prior to the previous Russin invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine had no real plan to join NATO, but Russia annexed Crimea anyways.\n\nThese so-called experts are writing fanfic versions of history, not basing their opinion on the actual history of Russia's continued incursions into Ukraine.",

They were jumping before anything was really changed at all.  Any time they can they gouge prices.  They know the American public will jump on the politics and blame.  Never looking at the fact that things were jumping before any impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo instead of exporting we could maybe use that here.  Keep those prices down.  But what is actually happening is gouging on price and that will never be taken care of.  The same Republicans in my area that throw the cost blame on Democrats would scoff at any kind of regulation on exports that would bring prices down.  They just do not realize that if we drill more oil we would just export it.  That was a huge reason for the pipeline enhancement they wanted to do.

I also took a ton of biology classes like Genetics, 2 levels of Micro, a few Environmental Science classes, and shit like that.  I graduated with slightly less than a 4.0 simply because I got a B in a class on education theory and a B in a class on fine art.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a brag here but I was told by the Dean, Dr.  Magraine of the Biology department that I had a future if I chose to study that.  Same by the Dean of the Business school.  During my partial differentials class a  professor from MIT was doing a presentation.  After class he offered me an associate position were I would work under hm and work on my advance degree.  Almost took it but I had my wife and young son here and I did not want to be away.  Later offered a position and Johns Hopkins University.  My big thing was that I mad a killing on the stock market game as a young man.  I invested in stocks as a game, mostly due to a college class that required a fake investment tracking making me realize how much I could make.\n\nThat was a good time for me.  I invest in a company, just one example, that was $1.  Jumped to $3.17 and I sold.  It was back down to $1 quick.  In the end I had taken $2k and made a little over $39k in a matter of a few weeks.  I did this with many stocks over the course of 3 years and built up quite a nest egg.  Some is invested in property as well as other more fluid assets.\n\n I mean, it is not like I am totally stupid here.  I see the supply and demand increase.  But it is not like this increase happened suddenly.  And this sudden jump in price is nothing more than a gouge because they can.  \n\nThe real question we have to ask ourselves here it this.  What happens when/if the supply decreases?  It is likely to decrease going forward.  And then they will say that they need to increase prices due to limited supply.  Because the things they claim right now will be real at that point.  But we will already have the price increase in place.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is ZERO way I do not see this hitting the economy hard.  A huge issue for Bush was that he pushed for oil and gas price increases and getting more exports.  The more it costs to transport things, to travel, all that, the more things will cost.  Last time it ran milk up from $1.80 a gallon here to $3.99 and it never dropped below $2.70 post recession.  Even when gas had dropped back to a little under $2 a gallon at first.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe one problem, different subject, is those stimulus things.  They helped at the time.  Yes, they created jobs by getting people spending and/or paying bills.  But we have not seen much in terms of wages.  Most here still make what they did pre-pandemic.  So future cost increases mean less buying power and less spending on many things.",

I can link you the information but it is readily available even through TransCanada.  It has the capacity to move 590k barrels a day to the midwest refineries.

As we have legalized bribery, and what feels like zero guard rails against corruption.\n\nYes right wing propaganda is a problem. That said, we wouldn't have \"news outlets\" like fox and oan if the [\"aristocracy of our monied corporations\"](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-10-02-0390) hadn't bought off politician to deregulate media markets to allow them to spread misinformation, own multiple TV, radio,  newspapers, without restriction...\n\nFor sure right wing propaganda has been what's caused or current rise of hate.  But the cause is that we let a few old money,  rich white dudes, with archaic and backwards ideology donate, seemingly unlimited funds, to put forth canidates they desire. Now am entire party is built on that.  \n\nAnd the other party seems like they don't want to rock the boat on their cash cows, so that's just never pointed out by MSM. But remember Trump essentially bought his way into the presidency as he had the money to find his primary even without RNC funds... how America hadn't realized we are a full blown oligarchic, plutocratic, aristocracy that works for the upper 10% of wealth, not the bottom 90%. \n\nMy point is, deregulation of media,  coupled with the rise of internet and social media (also not regulated due to our politicians being bought), have left us vulnerable to the rise of fascism.  But until we lock down the money in politics issues, they'll always be a way for some wealthy individual with crazy and dangerous views to be elected by simply buying access. Hell they don't need to even run themselves, as we can see if one greases enough wheels, one can just buy what they desire on the political front. \n\nImho, it's money in politics, our system of \"legalized bribery\", that has allowed for this rot of fascistic beliefs to permeate. That's our problem, we can't have a democracy if its pay to play, and pay to play will lead us down this road we are already find ourselves on. When money buys you more speech than everyone else, that can be used for exactly what it has been used for,  indoctrination.",

This tells you all you need to know about his intentions.\n\n**For weeks, we have been warning that this would happen.**\n\n**Last week, we have seen shelling increased in the Donbass. More cyberattacks, a state theater in Moscow, declaring that Ukraine committed a genocide &amp; was ready to use chemical weapons without any justification, without any evidence**\n\nAt the very moment the UN was meeting to starting, Putin declared his war.\n\nThen the missiles fell, the air raids, the tanks...\n\nWe have been transparent with the world, and declassified confidential information.\n\n**Let me be clear - Putin is the Aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the costs.**\n\n**I'm declaring new sanctions, designed for long-term impact on Russia and minimise impact on US&amp; allies. We are not doing this alone - More than 1/2 of the global economy (Au, Ja, Ger, ...) stand united in these sanctions. We will limit Russia's participation in the global economy, their ability to grow their economy, etc.**\n\n**We have already seen the impact on the Russian Rubel, which early today hits its weakest limit ever. Today's actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks ($1.3 Trillion assets) and other banks - cut off the American system - their assets will be frozen.**\n\nThis includes VBT. We will also sanction oligarchs and their family members. They profited off the system, they will share the pain.\n\nOn Tuesday, we stopped Russia from getting money from European banks. Our sanctions will now target the Russian industry.\n\nOne of the most powerful impact will come over time. We will cut off over more than 1/2 of Russia's tech imports. We will hurt their ability in space, ships and compete economically.\n\nWe will hurt Putin's long-term ambitions for Russia.\n\n**Tomorrow, we will convene NATO and confirm our unity and map the next steps. Our forces will not be engaged in conflict in Ukraine, but they will defend and assure our allies in the East. The United states will defend every inch of NATO territory. NATO is more united than ever. There's no doubt they will all meet the NATO 5 Article. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.**\n\nI have authorised deployment of troops in Estonia, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and XX. Our allies have also stepped up and given provisions.\n\nNATO came together and activated a response plan - we can deploy as and when to needed. I'm authorising an additional deployment to Germany - airforce troops (?). I have also discussed additional moves should they become necessary.\n\nMy government is doing everything to protect American families at the gas pump. Businesses should not exploit this to raise the prices. We are monitoring the prices of gas supply. We are working with other countries to ensure that the impact is minimal. US will be releasing additional barrels if warranted.\n\nIt's critical to me to me that American families will not be impacted.\n\nBut it would be much more if we let this agression continue.\n\n**If Russia continues to pursue cyberattacks, we will respond.** We have taken all precautions and are prepared for Cyber attacks. We will provide Ukraine with relief &amp; tech to relieve their suffering.\n\n..But the Ukrainians have known 30 years of independence, and they will not let their country be taken.\n\nThis is a dangerous moment for Europe. Now we all see what Putin and his allies are all about. This was never a security concern. It was always about changing is borders - a war without a cause.\n\n**The US and its allies will emerge from this stronger, united and more purposeful.

A little over a month after Biden was sworn in and the furor over January 6th had died down to the point that nothing was obviously going to come of it.  The announcement of intent to do this came in late February of 2021 from the Russian Defense Ministry.    \n  \nHe waited long enough to be sure his puppet was truly ousted and not coming back, realized his hand in the game was as good as it was going to get, and started his buildup then.

We like to imagine that people are rational and make decisions based on evidence, but the reality is that we're usually irrational. We make decisions in the moment based on feelings, and only retain evidence that supports them, as a form of confirmation bias. Our memories can be altered by the phrasing of questioning and events around them, and when our beliefs are challenged, we don't compromise, but actually drift apart into more extreme opinions.\n\nTrump's habit of telling different groups different things and keeping everyone arguing all of the time played perfectly to these flaws in our cognition, getting people to argue that Trump believes this or that, fighting every day into more extreme pro Trump positions, and failing to retain any evidence that doesn't support that.\n\nIt's just how the brain actually works. I'd recommend Democracy for Realists for a bunch of collected studies on these kinds of phenomena. It's important to note that the elite suffer all these same problems and make worse decisions overall than democracies, but that the idea of confronting someone who's wrong and changing their mind is little more than a fantasy. Confrontation always makes it worse, even if they believe something absurd, like that vaccines cause autism, or the world is secretly flat. And Trump mastered provoking confrontation.",

        "body": "**How much impact could Putin and Russia have over Donald Trump?**\r  \n\r  \nTrump has long admired Russia and has not hidden his admiration of Vladimir Putin. Two of his 3 wives he has married are both native born, Russian speaking and raised in Russian.\r  \n\r  \nDonald Trump the businessman has pursued business deals in Russia since the early 1980’s and has traveled there to explore potential business deals.\r  \n\r  \nAfter serious failures for Trump in the 1990’s Trump suddenly reemerged back on the scene. Trumps properties were flush with money from Russian leases. Trump Tower had whole floors devoted to Russian tenants and the building reached a level of 43% Russian leases.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIn 2008 at the height of the real estate housing bubble burst and when the majority of real estate companies were seeing revenues plummeting Trump was awash in cash. Donald Jr. in a 2008 interview, said at a New York conference, \"In terms of high-end, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,\" he went on to say, “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia”. You would have to say that is a fair number of Russian connections to this point.\r  \n\r  \nLet’s focus a bit and look at just 6 month’s worth of time in Trumps life. A very “short” snippet of time that is available for all to look at or research. A small slice of history, but in that slice is revealed extensive correspondence, personal contact, organized meetings with Trump, The Trump campaign, Trump staff, Trump advisors, Trump companions and the Trump family with Russia’s highest levels. \r  \n\r  \nDuring the timeframe of May 2016 thru to November 2016 Trump and his associates had over 140 direct connections to Russian intelligence &amp; government officials. These contacts went unreported even though, such contacts are required by several laws. Contacts that purposely attempted to hide the contact and the conversations that transpired. Some contacts though weren’t even a little subtle.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone should be able to remember when, Trump while looking directly into a camera Infamously and openly asked Putin for a favor when he notoriously said, “Russia if your listening”. Trump Sr., explicitly pleaded Russia to hack Clinton’s emails. That should give us an idea of how comfortable Donald Trump was with Russia and bring into question how much contact with Russia he actually had. \r  \n\r  \nAfter that, Donnie Jr. held meetings with Russians where he was directly seeking information from them that could be used against Clinton, even though they were Russian operatives who were working on behalf of the Kremlin.\r  \n\r  \nIt is established that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election. They hacked into DNC party servers and finding emails that were actually written by Democratic individuals and members of the Clinton campaign. They then released those emails on website (Wikileaks) run Julian Assange just after the meeting with Donald Jr., at a critical time in the campaign to adversely affect Clinton and to bolster Trump.\r  \n\r  \nPrior to any American campaigning, Assange was indicted in America on 17 charges relating to the Espionage Act in the United States District Court. Under the Espionage Act charges Assange was facing a sentence of 170 years in prison. Assange was indited for his role in the publication of secret American documents on his website Wikileaks.\r  \n\r  \nRepublican leaders and the conservative media figures had been demanding prison time (or worse) for Julian Assange for years. Suddenly, with Trump’s requests and the release of information that negatively impacted his Democratic opponent they were abruptly praising the Australian “anarchist”. \r  \n\r  \nFrom that request for Russian help, it has been established that LOTS of people in Trump’s circle had repeated contacts with Russians. These contacts lead to an investigation that resulted in dozens of criminal inditements. Inditements that had five of six of Trump closest advisers pleading guilty.\r  \n\r  \nThe list of Trump associates who had contacts during just the six months in question is staggering and formidable. Below is a short list (but not all) of some of those who were close to Trump, who held key positions, some of who were indited and some who lied about contacts with Russians.\r  \n\r  \n•\tSteve Bannon former campaign chief (Trump Pardoned)\r  \n•\tPaul Manafort Trump campaign chairman (Trump Pardoned)\r  \n•\tRick Gates Deputy Trump campaign manager \r  \n•\tRudy Giuliani Trumps personal advisor\r  \n•\tMichael Flynn Trump's National Security Adviser (Trump Pardoned)\r  \n•\tJeff Sessions, Trumps first Attorney General, \r  \n•\tDonald Trump Jr.\r  \n•\tSam Patten Republican donor operative\r  \n•\tRoger Stone campaign advisor (Trump Pardoned)\r  \n•\tTom Barrack, the chairman of Trump's Inaugural Committee\r  \n•\tAlex van der Zwaan a lawyer with Manafort (the son-in-law of Russian oligarch German Khan George)\r  \n•\tGeorge Papadopoulos Trumps foreign policy adviser, Michael Cohen Trumps personal attorney. \r  \n\r  \nTrump ran as the most pro-Russian candidate for president, He candidly admired Vladimir Putin’s manly virtues at every opportunity. Putin is a career KGB officer, who unambiguously hates America and has pursued the dismantling of NATO his entire career. \r  \n\r  \nTrumps visibly friendly relationship with Putin despite the numerous issues that came to light during Trumps Presidential term has had negative effects on the American psyche. According to a poll shows a shocking 49 percent of Republicans now consider Russia an ally. A nearly triple increase among Republicans in the last two years of Trumps term.",

        "body": "Biden's strategy on Ukraine is actually very smart and calculated.\n\nBy saying war is almost a certainty and that Putin intended to invade and takeover Kyiv (even if Putin doesn't seriously intend to do that), it puts Russia in a tricky position. And it has lots of upsides for Biden and the US.\n\nFirstly,  it puts fear into other European nations, like Finland and Sweden who aren't a part of NATO. Finland for example just signed a 9 billion deal for fighter jets with the US. It will help push more weapons going into Poland and Romania. Biden has been under pressure by the military industry because he came out against the big arms deals with Saudi Arabia. So he needs to fill that gap somehow and Ukraine provides a great opportunity.\n\nSecondly, just like Russia, US politics feeds off having a great enemy. It's what feeds the US military budget. After pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan the US military was in the weird position of not having a major conflict to contend with for the first time in 20 years. The re-emergence of Russia as the great enemy helps fill that void.\n\nThirdly, this strategy of playing up the likelihood of a Russian war of aggression helps Biden domestically. We know that many in the mainstream press have Russia aligned with Trump and many Republicans. So by hyping Russia as a great threat to Europe, to democracy, freedom etc, it helps Biden politically at home, as it can help counter the idea of Trump wanting to warm relations with Russia was a good thing.\n\nFourthly, it's in the US strategic interests to try and get Russia involved in a new costly conflict. If the US wants to undermine the Putin regime, they need new reasons to inflict punishing sanctions - and get the Europeans to join in. And if Russia gets into a costly war, that helps the US. The US won't get directly involved but can covertly feed the conflict with weapons, support etc. It's a low investment strategy with a good payoff as Russia and Ukraine bare the biggest costs. Ukrainians will likely be the biggest losers but so be it. The benefits for the US and Biden outweigh any collateral damage that might be inflicted on Ukraine.",

I'll concede that that's possible, but I think it's far likelier that Putin, a former KGB foreign intel officer, has held very realist, power-driven views of foreign policy his whole life.

We will put intense pressure on their largest and most significant financial institutions and key industries.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These measures are ready to go as soon and if Russia moves.  We’ll impose long-term consequences that will undermine Russia’s ability to compete economically and strategically.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And when it comes to Nord Stream 2, the pipeline that would bring natural gas from Russia to Germany, if Russia further invades Ukraine, it will not happen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**While I will not send American servicemen to fight Russia in Ukraine, we have supplied the Ukrainian military with equipment to help them defend themselves.  We have provided training and advice and intelligence for the same purpose.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**And make no mistake: The United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power.  An attack against one NATO country is an attack against all of us.  And the United States commitment to Article 5 is sacrosanct.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Already, in response to Russia’s build-up of troops, I have sent additional U.S. forces to bolster NATO’s eastern flank.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Several of our Allies have also announced they’ll add forces and capabilities to ensure deterrence and defense along NATO’s eastern flank.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We will also continue to conduct military exercises with our Allies and partners to enhance defensive readiness.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And if Russia invades, we will take further steps to reinforce our presence in NATO, reassure for our Allies, and deter further aggression.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And if Russia attacks the United States or our Allies through asymmetric means, like disruptive cyberattacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We’re moving in lockstep with our NATO Allies and partners to deepen our collective defense against threats in cyberspace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, at the Munich Security Conferenec, German defense minister Baerbock said on sanctions:\n\n&gt;These sanctions are – or would be unprecedented and have been coordinated with all our partners and have been prepared with them.  **We in Germany are ready to pay a high price for that in economic terms. That is why all options are on the table – also Nord Stream 2.

Autocratic societies have a lot of advantages in this space compared to democracies. It would tighten or completely fracture NATO, but Russia would have free reign on pretty much anything non-NATO related. If it opened pandora's box and any other country ever used them after shaming Russia so hard for it, Russia would take the moral high ground and spread the whole \"Western hypocrisy\" trope that they love so much. \n\nIt's like Putin using weapons of mass destruction to kill people on UK soil. You would say that there is no game theory scenario that is worth it ... yet he has still done it. It not only proves his power and reach, but lets people know that he is to be feared and you cannot assign your definition of rationality to him - but he understands the rules that the rest of the world plays by. \n\nI don't think that he'll do it because then Germany definitely stops buying his gas and is 100% in line with the US. Right now, his best chance at fracturing NATO is by making the US promise that they'll kill that pipeline and having it either not be killed due to Germany moving out of step with the US or it being killed and the German people blaming the US for rising energy prices. The people in the US will then blame Biden for higher energy prices, and Trump will win in 2024... though that is honestly the most likely outcome of the election anyway, and it'll be interesting to see how this all plays out/would play out with Trump at the wheel.

But that hasn't necessarily prevented the right-wing part of the government from using the same tactics we see our right-wing using to chip away at them, such as some European countries are seeing their universities beginning to implement tuition fees.\n\nThough, we can also see a xenophobic sledgehammer being swung with things like Brexit. Imagine: completely destroying your economy and your trade deals because you don't want immigrants taking your jobs. That was seriously one of the biggest reasons for it, a fear of ~~Mexican~~ Polish immigrants taking the jobs of hardworking ~~Americans~~ Britons.\n\nJust look at Switzerland, low taxes, high healthcare costs, and compulsory private insurance that will cost over 250 euros per month for the most basic coverage.\n\nYou have Greece, which has so much government corruption that it is collapsing into itself with bribery being a way of life.\n\nSure, there are some left-wing and some right-wing leaning countries. But then there are countries whose current leading parties are modeled after the US Republican party.\n\nThe myth was something that has been spread for decades by edgy anti-authorty teens who listen to Morrissey and think everyone else is blind to the reality of the world.

Countries know how to conduct training operations that are not misread as invasions, which is why you don't constantly hear about nations freaking out that they think they're about to be invaded due to their neighbor conducting an exercise (save for NK's histrionics)\n\n&gt;Russia already started WWIII by invading Crimea.\n\nWe are not in the midst of an 8 year long world war.",

        "body": "True for the most part, but Crimea was full of ethically Russian people who had no want to oppose Russia and Ukraine wasn’t in the position to fight for a piece of land that the people on it didn’t want to fight for. Today the Ukrainian forces are larger, bolstered by modern weapons from western countries, and have been training since Crimea for what they felt was an inevitable Russian invasion. Crimea being annexed was considered a huge slap in the face to the Ukrainian people and it caused a wave of anti Russian sentiment. So the Ukrainian people aren’t likely to just roll over like Crimea and the army will be fighting on their soil for their freedom. What we don’t know is how many Ukrainian politicians and powerful people or even military leaders are in bed with Russia. The Ukraine government has a history of corruption and those in power lining their own pockets despite the people. How many of them are still in positions of power and how many Putin has bought off will be a large deciding factor on how easy an invasion will go. If Russia doesn’t have the cards in place to take Ukraine swiftly and with relative ease and instead has to fight a bloody war that turns them into an occupying force it will become a drastically expensive endeavor that far outweighs the gains for Russia. Russia may have a relatively large military but their economy isn’t even in the top ten. If they invade they can weather the sanctions to come, but if the fighting continues it will bleed Russia out. We may yet be in the brinksmanship phase of this with Russian troops crossing into Ukraine as the final we will do it but not pushing far enough to engage the Ukrainian forces allowing a last minute deal, but it likely all comes down to what assets Russia controls in the Ukrainian government and that is hard to speculate on.",

The protest is because a situation is so untenable that people abandon their jobs for a day to take to the streets. But then, as a result of protest, their either needs to be an end to the untenable situation or a compromise.\n\nWhat we have is a situation where one party is completely in control of the government and their ideologically opposed brethren protest, but the ruling party's constituency largely doesn't care because they're in control. When things get to a dangerous point, select Congressional Republicans apply a pressure release (like saying Marino is not acceptable after the 60 Minutes/WaPo report or voting against the ACA repeal) to appease *their* base before things get out of hand.\n\nAs a result, the Republican constituency sees their legislators making compromise, but liberals/Democrats continuing to protest because. A perception is created that Democrats will protest no matter what, so why bother ever conceding anything. This, interestingly, is like what happened with the Tea Party and Congress when Obama was President, with one important difference: Democrats repeatedly came to the table to negotiate when Republican constituents would protest. However, due to Norquist and McConnell's active campaign to oppose Obama no matter the cost, Republicans would always vote no, even when the compromise was in their favor, with select exceptions as a pressure valve. In conservative news, this was portrayed as a refusal by liberals to compromise. This led to the disastrous 2010 election, capture of government by Republicans, and the current state of affairs.\n\nIt all boils down to control of perception.

For decades there was status quo and even pro-Western governments of Ukraine wasn't anti-Russian. One reason was because Ukraine itself have big Russian population and radical anti-Russian agenda is suicidal for country  integrity. Yanukovych was elected as response for former President pro-Western policy. Also, there was already tension between pro-Russian and anti-Russian population. So every President of Ukraine tried to avoid tension on this hot political theme, because it's for sure would lead to civil war. After radical anti-Russian coup actual civil war was started and Russia undoubtedly starts to support pro-Russian forces and USA starts to support anti-Russian forces. All this essentially became proxy war between Russia and USA! And all of that started just because balance was shifted by USA intervention. It's why I called it \"extreme incompetency of USA foreign policy\". USA shouldn't pull any strings at all. There was already frozen conflict which have its roots in WW2 history. At WW2 there historically was support for Nazis in Ukraine and Ukraine was one of historical hosts of Holocaust. It's why far-right neo-Nazis now go wild - unresolved issues from WW2 history now have surfaced. USA have no knowledge about region political and historical tensions.

    "selftext": "Within the next year or two, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security will instantly know everything about your body, clothes, and luggage with a new laser-based molecular scanner fired from 164 feet (50 meters) away. From traces of drugs or gun powder on your clothes to what you had for breakfast to the adrenaline level in your body—agents will be able to get any information they want without even touching you. And without you knowing it.\n\nThe technology is so incredibly effective that, in November 2011, its inventors were subcontracted by In-Q-Tel to work with the US Department of Homeland Security. In-Q-Tel is a company founded \"in February 1999 by a group of private citizens at the request of the Director of the CIA and with the support of the U.S. Congress.\" According to In-Q-Tel, they are the bridge between the Agency and new technology companies.\n\nTheir plan is to install this molecular-level scanning in airports and border crossings all across the United States. The official, stated goal of this arrangement is to be able to quickly identify explosives, dangerous chemicals, or bioweapons at a distance.\n\nThe machine is ten million times faster—and one million times more sensitive—than any currently available system. That means that it can be used systematically on everyone passing through airport security, not just suspect or randomly sampled people.\n\nAnalyzing everything in real time\n\nBut the machine can sniff out a lot more than just explosives, chemicals and bioweapons. The company that invented it, Genia Photonics, says that its laser scanner technology is able to \"penetrate clothing and many other organic materials and offers spectroscopic information, especially for materials that impact safety such as explosives and pharmacological substances.\" [PDF]\n\nFormed in Montreal in 2009 by PhDs with specialties in lasers and fiber optics, Genia Photonics has 30 patents on this technology, claiming incredible biomedical and industrial applications—from identifying individual cancer cells in a real-time scan of a patient, to detecting trace amounts of harmful chemicals in sensitive manufacturing processes.\n\nAbove: The Genia Photonics' Picosecond Programmable Laser scanner is capable of detecting every tiny trace of any substance on your body, from specks of gunpowder to your adrenaline levels to a sugar-sized grain of cannabis to what you had for breakfast.\n\nMeanwhile, In-Q-Tel states that \"an important benefit of Genia Photonics' implementation as compared to existing solutions is that the entire synchronized laser system is comprised in a single, robust and alignment-free unit that may be easily transported for use in many environments… This compact and robust laser has the ability to rapidly sweep wavelengths in any pattern and sequence.\" [PDF]\n\nSo not only can they scan everyone. They would be able to do it everywhere: the subway, a traffic light, sports events... everywhere.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe machine is a mobile, rack-mountable system. It fires a laser to provide molecular-level feedback at distances of up to 50 meters in just picoseconds. For all intents and purposes, that means instantly.\n\nThe small, inconspicuous machine is attached to a computer running a program that will show the information in real time, from trace amounts of cocaine on your dollar bills to gunpowder residue on your shoes. Forget trying to sneak a bottle of water past security—they will be able to tell what you had for breakfast in an instant while you're walking down the hallway.\n\nThe technology is not new, it's just millions times faster and more convenient than ever before. Back in 2008, a team at George Washington University developed a similar laser spectrometer using a different process. It could sense drug metabolites in urine in less than a second, trace amounts of explosive residue on a dollar bill, and even certain chemical changes happening in a plant leaf.\n\nAnd the Russians also have a similar technology: announced last April, their \"laser sensor can pick up on a single molecule in a million from up to 50 meters away.\"\n\nSo if Genia Photonics' claims pan out, this will be an incredible leap forward in terms of speed, portability, and convenience. One with staggering implications.\n\n\nThere has so far been no discussion about the personal rights and privacy issues involved. Which \"molecular tags\" will they be scanning for? Who determines them? What are the threshold levels of this scanning? If you unknowingly stepped on the butt of someone's joint and are carrying a sugar-sized grain of cannabis like that unfortunate traveler currently in jail in Dubai, will you be arrested?\n\nAnd, since it's extremely portable, will this technology extend beyone the airport or border crossings and into police cars, with officers looking for people on the street with increased levels of adrenaline in their system to detain in order to prevent potential violent outbursts? And will your car be scanned at stoplights for any trace amounts of suspicious substances? Would all this information be recorded anywhere?\n\nThere are a lot of questions with no answer yet, but it's obvious that the potential level of personal invasion of this technology goes far beyond that of body scans, wiretaps, and GPS tracking.\n\nAccording to the undersecretary for science and technology of the Department of Homeland Security, this scanning technology will be ready within one to two years, which means you might start seeing them in airports as soon as 2013.

While the medical uses could revolutionize the way doctors diagnose illness, and any technology that could replace an aggressive pat-down is tempting, there's a potential dark side to this implementation, and we need to shine some light on it before it's implemented.\n\n\n[The author of this story is currently completing his PhD in renewable energy solutions, focusing on converting waste to energy in the urban environment.

    "selftext": "A Child's Guide To United States Foreign Policy\n\n\n\nQ: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?\nA: Because they had weapons of mass destruction honey.\n\nQ: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.\n\nQ: And that's why we invaded Iraq?\n\nA: Yep. Invasions always work better than inspections.\n\nQ: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction?\n\nA: To use them in a war, silly.\n\nQ: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war with them?\n\nA: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had those weapons, so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.\n\nQ: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?\n\nA: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make sense.\n\nQ: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.\n\nA: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.\n\nQ: And what was that?\n\nA: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.\n\nQ: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?\n\nA: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.\n\nQ: Kind of like what they do in China?\n\nA: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.\n\nQ: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?\n\nA: Right.\n\nQ: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?\n\nA: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.\n\nQ: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?\n\nA: I told you, China is different.\n\nQ: What's the difference between China and Iraq?\n\nA: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.\n\nQ: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?\n\nA: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.\n\nQ: How are the Cuban Communists bad?\n\nA: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.\n\nQ: Like in Iraq?\n\nA: Exactly.\n\nQ: And like in China, too?\n\nA: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.\n\nQ: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?\n\nA: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being communists and started being capitalists like us.\n\nQ: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba, and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?\n\nA: Don't be a smart-ass.\n\nQ: I didn't think I was being one.\n\nA: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.\n\nQ: Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement?\n\nA: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway, Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.\n\nQ: What's a military coup?\n\nA: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.\n\nQ: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?\n\nA: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.\n\nQ: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?\n\nA: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.\n\nQ: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?\n\nA: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.\n\nQ: Why did we invade Afghanistan?\n\nA: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.\n\nQ: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?\n\nA: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings, killing over 3,000 Americans.\n\nQ: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?\n\nA: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.\n\nQ: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?\n\nA: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.\n\nQ: Didn't the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?\n\nA: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.\n\nQ: Fighting drugs?\n\nA: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.\n\nQ: How did they do such a good job?\n\nA: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.\n\nQ: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?\n\nA: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.\n\nQ: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?\n\nA: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.\n\nQ: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too?\n\nA: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body covering.\n\nQ: What's the difference?\n\nA: The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes and fingers.\n\nQ: It sounds like the same thing with a different name.\n\nA: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.\n\nQ: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.\n\nA: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.\n\nQ: Who trained them?\n\nA: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.\n\nQ: Was he from Afghanistan?\n\nA: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.\n\nQ: I seem to recall he was our friend once.\n\nA: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.\n\nQ: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire Ronald Reagan talked about?\n\nA: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or thereabouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.\n\nQ: So the Soviets ? I mean, the Russians ? are now our friends?\n\nA: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, but then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraq either.\n\nQ: So the French and Germans are evil, too?\n\nA: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.\n\nQ: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?\n\nA: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we invade.\n\nQ: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the 1980s?\n\nA: Well, yeah. For a while.\n\nQ: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?\n\nA: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.\n\nQ: Why did that make him our friend?\n\nA: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.\n\nQ: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?\n\nA: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.\n\nQ: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?\n\nA: Most of the time, yes.\n\nQ: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?\n\nA: Sometimes that's true, too. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all the better.\n\nQ: Why?\n\nA: Because war is good for the economy, which means war is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?\n\nQ: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to, right?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?\n\nA: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.\n\nQ: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?\n\nA: Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.",

The OWS movement has brought attention, even positive attention, to some very central issues embedded in the American political system. But, what then? Simple revelation of problems does nothing to actually solve them, especially problems this deep-seated. The movement, for all of its noble intentions, simply does not have the kind of political power to effect a real change.\n\nAllow me to explain. Let's first examine the direct influence of the protesters. It's hardly a viable option to physically storm buildings and attempt to forcibly remove corrupt individuals from their positions. It's also not a good idea to become violent. But, as has been brought up before, the harsh months are coming, and the sheer cold and weather will become powerful weapons against the protesters; consider the admittedly more egregious example of the Russian invasions of Napoleon and Hitler. The opposition to the protests can use the oppressive climate to both incite protesters (as the weather wears on their tempers) and drive them out as they become fed up with the difficulty of maintaining position. As people do leave, the corporate media (tangent: Can we begin using this term instead of \"mainstream media\"?) will use this as \"evidence\" that the movement is losing steam.\n\nIndirectly, the power of the protesters lies in voting (including, but not limited to, recall, petition to redress grievances, and actual voting for candidates). However, any candidate that the movement puts up will by necessity be a single person. This person then becomes the *de facto* strawman for opposition of the party to shoot down. In addition, if the candidate *does* manage to win, then he or she still faces two other branches of government, which will limit his or her ability to effect change. The Congressional issue can be solved, temporarily, by voting in Senators and Representatives that represent the wishes of the movement, but again, representatives become elevated above the mass, and this undermines the message of the movement.\n\nFrom any angle I look at the future, it seems that all routes are either impossible, unfeasible, illogical, temporary, or ineffective. While the absolute last thing I want to see is for this movement to die, I simply cannot see a way to move forward. \n\nThis does NOT, however, mean that there are *no* ways forward; the movement has had many moments thus far that I would not have predicted, and which few people could have come up with individually. The solution is for, at the very least, a committee of future planning be set up whose sole purpose is looking toward the future of the movement: Not just the goals, but the actual actions. Yes, it is very important to stay up-to-date with what is happening on the front lines, but I have not seen anywhere near as many discussions about where to go from here. At this point, the movement has garnered national and international attention. It is time to begin focusing on what to *do* with this attention, and how the problems inherent in the system can be efficiently and permanently rectified.",
