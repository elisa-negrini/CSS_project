There were a lot of monuments of various Russia/Soviet persons, who have minimal connection or no connection at all to Ukraine. Those monuments slowly removed before the war, because it is soviet past, not ukrainian past.  
Ukrainian government tried to implement more wide use of Ukrainian language.  
Both actions were considered as greatest offense by Russia, somehow.They believe we in Ukraine should speak Russian and have Russian history, not Ukrainian, because we are nothing more, than little broken Russians.

Like, you guys used to have russian language and literature classes at school just a few decades ago, didn’t you? And russia has a habit of using those kind of “russian culture lovers clubs/classes” as its soft power, pushing imperialistic narratives in-between the lines.

I’ve also heard those narratives aren’t tolerated in Bulgaria these days and that’s really a big step. But that doesn’t cancel out the two older generations that have already soaked in the narrative and might push it upon younger people who avoided the Soviet period.

Honestly, I believe most people around 40 or older aren’t prone to changing their mind, so there might be nothing to be done. Just keep on educating yourself and researching the topics, reach out in this community if you have any doubts.

To answer your question: no, there have been no violent oppressions. In-between 2014 and 2022 (8 years in the war on the eastern front) Ukraine has finally removed russian language’s status of one of the official ones in the country and it finally stopped being taught in schools. Those kinda laws appeared. But that barely affected the lives of russian-speaking citizens and ethnic russians. That I can tell and actually show you first hand :)

So in case you want to change your dad’s mind, I invite you and him to come to Ukraine. It’s not as dangerous as it might seem and I’d be happy to show you guys around Lviv, Kyiv, as well as Odesa and Kharkiv.

Went there voluntarily cos at the time I wanted to learn Russian. That was over 10 years ago tho. My opinion on Russian culture hasn't changed but my opinion on the Russian state sure as hell has.

Beyond that, one of the major parties in our parliament is a far right ethno-nationalist gang of thugs and their leader is a first grade Putin dicksucker. And our ""socialist"" party, the remnants of the old ""communist"" party are all a bunch of cowards who didn't even have the balls to condemn Russia after news about the Bucha massacre spread. 

As for the people themselves, from what I've seen of the pro-Russian/anti-EU protests there's like, 3 groups of people who show up: dumbfuck rightwing nationalist ""patriots"", old people and paid protestors. Overall they're a minority but they're loud. Most Bulgarians have a general distaste for Russia, not least because we all know how far Russia has shoved its dick in our politics and has done so for decades. 

Yeah, I read about the removal of Russian from the school curriculum and as a recognised regional language. That seems to be what the Russians are basing their claims of repression on. That and I have a vague memory of reading an article about some club building or something that got burned down years ago in Eastern Ukraine but I can't find it now.

As for the “club building”, I think I know what you’re talking about. It happened back in 2014 in Odesa (with one S, correcting my phone again here ._.).

Ukraine has been an independent sovereign nation for more than 32 years but the Soviet-era versions of many geographic names stubbornly persist in international practice. The transliterations of the names of cities, regions and rivers from the Cyrillic alphabet into Latin are often mistakenly based on the Russian form of the name, not the Ukrainian; the most misspelled names are:

|||
|-|-|
|**Archaic Soviet-era spelling**|**Correct modern spelling**|
|the Ukraine|Ukraine|
|Kiev|Kyiv|
|Lvov|Lviv|
|Odessa|Odesa|
|Kharkov|Kharkiv|
|Nikolaev|Mykolaiv|
|Rovno|Rivne|
|Ternopol|Ternopil|
|Chernobyl|Chornobyl|

Under the Russian empire and later the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Russification was actively used as a tool to extinguish each constituent country’s national identity, culture and language. In light of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, including its illegal occupation of Crimea, we are once again experiencing Russification as a tactic that attempts to destabilize and delegitimize our country. You will appreciate, we hope, how the use of Soviet-era placenames – rooted in the Russian language – is especially painful and unacceptable to the people of Ukraine.

These are the people being killed by russian drones and executed by russian terrorists. These are the people on the front lines protecting their homes from russian occupation.

“Separatists” were russian infiltrators. By the time the locals figured that this hostile takeover was for real and will not go away, it was already too late.

Reality and refutation

* **No evidence of genocide:** Investigations by the International Court of Justice and other bodies found no credible evidence to support Russia's genocide claims.
* **Russian involvement in Donbas:** Contrary to Russian narratives, evidence suggests direct Russian military and financial support for separatists in Donbas since 2014.
* **Ukrainian identity:** The invasion, ironically, strengthened Ukrainian national identity and solidified support for a path away from Russia. 

In essence, Russia's justification for its actions in Donbas and the subsequent invasion relied on a campaign of false promises and propaganda, including unfounded allegations and fabricated pretexts designed to sow confusion and gain support for its military agenda.

They played a critical role in the abduction of thousands of children from Ukraine.   Fortunately a number of them subsequently defected and testified in the International Criminal Court (ICC).  Their testimony in the Hague helped in the prosecution of Putin for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  If Putin really is the good guy how come he's a war criminal?

The ""Little Green Men"" were ready because for years they were actively involved in false flag attacks on civilians in the Donbas.   Take for example the testimony of Igor Salikov, an officer of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

[https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/)

&gt;Having been involved in Russia’s war against Ukraine since 2014, Salikov witnessed Russia’s covert takeover and hybrid warfare in eastern Ukraine. In a bombshell interview with with founder Vladimir Osechkin, he tells how chief puppetmaster Vladislav Surkov carefully constructed the fiction of a “Donbas uprising,” how he and other Russian proxies were allowed to use only legacy Soviet equipment to avoid giving Russia away, and how Russia conducted shelled its own territory to frame Ukraine, constructing the Big Lie of a “Donbas genocide.” 

Before the war, the number of civilian deaths in the Donbas was declining and nothing like what it now is due to Putin's blatant shameless war of aggression.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/)

&gt;Prior to the war, fighting took place in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and separatist forces supported by the Russian government. Over the course of 2021, 25 conflict-related deaths were recorded in Ukraine. Between April 14 and December 31, 2014, the number of killed civilians exceeded 2,084. These include 298 victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) which was shot down in July 2014.

I'm guessing your dad doesn't care about the 298 civilians killed when a commercial plane was shot down by the DPR in July 2014.   They don't count because they're not 'ethnic Russians'.

If Putin cared a jot about civilian deaths would he now be levelling villages, towns and cities across Ukraine?  Even Trump has admitted Putin's response to his peace talks is to launch mass attacks against civilians night after night after night.",2025-07-30T16:01:31

You choose what you want to believe or are open to an idea and then you find or come across reasons to reinforce that believe. 


I think there is some sense in that. I have a brother in law that keeps bringing up pro russian thoughts or anti-semetic stuff.  


Instead of arguing we just let him know that we are not interested in discussing these topics. Especially since this only happens in a whatsapp group chat and the bigger portion off things he sends are either links through instagram reels or just a long message with the notion of some documentary that we should definitely watch. 


I think his main motivation to come up with all this is his tendency to not be mainstream and have some sense that he understands it all and everyone else is in the dark. Must feel good. 


My idea of dealing with this is to ask open questions and dive deeper in where the need to keep reading into this and watch documentaries and follow IG accounts, comes from. Just to be interested in him as a family member and not to discuss. This creates space and removed the idea that he is the special one to understand and no one else is interested. I am interested but in the end I draw different conclusions and have a different opinion. 


If someone is not interested to hear my ideas, the it does not make sense to discuss them. I can only show interest and hope someone returns the favor. 


But unfortunately we don't come to that point since it's only happened in a group chat where in the and almost everyone ask to stop sending IG reels. And we don't speak that often IRL.

This one passage will probably require hundreds of pages to unpack. But it's absolutely false. As a matter of fact, before Maidan, in 2012, pro-Russian politicians brought to power by the Kremlin passed the infamous ""Kivalov-Kolesnichenko"" law, which heavily expanded ""regional"" languages and gave more power to the Russian language. It pretty much allowed regional languages to be used as official language if more than 10% of the region spoke the language. It was revoked in 2014. The biggest thing that really changed for an average person after it was revoked was that any official forms or documents would have to be completed in the national language, Ukrainian. Which was the case anyway before 2012. Documents were done in two languages anyway - Ukrainian and Russian. Not just in the region, but throughout Ukraine. 

It affected nothing else pretty much. Russian books weren't banner, Russian TV was still available via cable or antennas if the coverage was there, and so on. 

Who really suffered in Ukraine for DECADES are people choosing to speak Ukrainian in urban areas, heavily Russified over the Soviet period. Especially in the east, in places like Donbas. People would be ridiculed and mocked. I had a colleague like that in Donetsk. She moved from Lviv with her husband for work and spoke Ukrainian her whole life. Now, the immediate circle was great, as everyone was more or less educated and a decent human being. But I'd still catch people ""from the outside"" throwing glances at her once they heard her speak. She'd often be treated with dumb ""bandera"" jokes or other stupid comments. She often spoke about harassment and bullying. 

As a mirror example, her husband was a Russian speaker who grew up in Lviv, but never really felt oppressed. 

Everything else is manufactured propaganda. Russians are good at playing the victim card and too many people buy into that shit. Remind your dad that Hitler used the same type of excuse to start WWII. ""Defending ethnic ABC\_XYZ"" and all that bullshit is nothing new.",2025-07-30T14:44:36

So she kept spreading nonsence and beleived in what was convinient for her to keep in touch with her Russian friends.

You can't communicate with a lunatic. P.S. I was born in Russia so I surely would have experience supposed ""repressions"" against Russians if they were real. They are not. If anything, under Russian occupation (including Soviet occupation) Ukrainians were always persecuted in Ukraine for their ethinicity just for refusing to accept Russian identity.

Fast foward to now and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, similar situation existed. Putin basically sold off on the same concept of how he needed to unite the slavic people and regain former glory. The problem is, the empire lost for good reasosn and it will not come back. This is like the last, death gasp of a once mighty empire that will make things uncomfortable for its neighbors.

I don’t know enough about Bulgaria to tell you why it’s different, but I will try. Ohrid was the capital of Bulgaria or important so Kyiv was a capital or a city state it was its own identity. I believe Bulgaria Sofia is older than Ohrid for sure than Skopje. So there is that while moscow is not. That is first idea. Macedonia is a Greek name so they speak Bulgarian but use a Greek name and try to take both histories. I will tell you one thing though you guys are proud of inventing Cyrillic? If putin comes Bulgaria wouldn’t have invented nothing russia would have. You would speak russian. I don’t know why or what problem fyroms have with Bulgaria, I can see how your dad thinks that communism “created” them, the same way ruzzian ppl believe Ukrainians were created by communism. I would maybe lay into the fact that the fyrmaceos are taking two people’s cultures. While Ukraine is really the predecessor to the god forsaken ruzzian people. With Volodymyr in Kyiv and his three sons fighting for Kyiv and starting new settlements. So maybe a stretch you could say which is true for Ukrainians is that russians want Ukrainian history while Ukrainians don’t want their name to be linked to the atrocities of russia. So Ukraine is having its history stolen in a manor similar to Bulgarians via FyrMaceo is. Difference being ruzzia is not impotent but quite dangerous and treacherous while fyr maceo is like some crazy kid foaming at the mouth while he has his house full of Albanians.",2025-07-31T07:10:27
1md5jv2,My dad keeps repeating Russian propaganda,Rock_Zeppelin,1186,2025-07-30T12:41:32,Inner-Detail-553,1,"I’ve dealt with the same from relatives, it bugged me a lot, so I thought about where this comes from a lot

Basically I think it’s nostalgia… for a lot of old folks in Eastern Europe, life was better *for them* in the 70s and 80s. If your dad was working in the 80s, had active social life, you kids were young - and now he’s retired, social life is just hanging out with other old folks and watching tv/reading facebook… sure the 80s was better, so it’s easy to think it was because of communism. Being in the Soviet sphere but on the periphery was also way better than being in Russia itself. I mean compare growing up in Sofia in the 1960s or 70s vs let’s say Chelyabinsk (same size city in Russia) at the same time, Sofia seems like paradise by comparison. Add to that Russians are still seen in very positive light in Bulgaria because of the liberation from the Turks, so the idea of them conquering anyone causes a lot of cognitive dissonance there in particular

The main bit of advice I have is just watch “Servant of the People” with him over some rakiya. It has Zelensky playing the main character, it’s hilarious (if you grew up in old soviet republic) and it’s in Russian. Also was super popular show on Ukrainian TV in 2015-2016. So any kind of “Russians are oppressed” story is kinda obvious bs just from that

P.S. I say the show is in Russian but that’s not entirely true, it goes back and forth sometimes so quickly you can miss it. From what I remember in the opening scene Zelensky (playing a school teacher) is talking to the kids in his class in Russian, one of the kids asks a question in Ukrainian and he answers in Ukrainian, then continues in Russian, it’s seamless",2025-07-31T07:23:27

They can do whatever afterwards. I would never advocate for us to invade them or argue against their right to self determination. But my dad thinks because in Macedonia people who self-identify as Bulgarians are being repressed and mistreated, that we have the right to invade Macedonia to ""defend"" them. And he applies this reasoning to Russia and Ukraine which given that the claims of ethnic Russians being repressed are made up I don't see how the two cases can be compared. And again, I would argue this means the Macedonian Bulgarians should either rise up and fight for their rights, or just move to Bulgaria permanently.",2025-07-31T13:51:07

it's awful but it's true. the only method I found to be comparatively useful is asking for the source of information or articles from different countries. if the piece of news exists only in the russian or pro-russian information field — it's propaganda. 

however, it's really hard to prove that the thing doesn't work vice-versa as, by Soviet ideas, there is no chance russia would give their citizens news that are discrediting towards themselves. this thing is always the same — they claim to be the strongest and richest ever, but someone is always trying to invade them for some reason. and it's the best authoritarian tactics: if people start to suspect something in government — start a war! that's how they get carried away and start justifying their poor lifestyle. 

overall, I suggest you start with debunking the fundamental part of his beliefs. there's a ton of videos on YouTube about Soviet propaganda in history, movies and their cartoons. maybe that can change the way he believes russia as a more trusted source🤔",2025-08-01T04:41:22

The only reasons so many Ukrainians fought in the Red Army are that the Germans had no real use (nor an established doctrine) to press-gang opponents or [Untermenschen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch) like the Ukrainians for service in the Wehrmacht AND the Russians had zero shame using barrier troops and commissars to maintain ""discipline"" on the battlefield stuffed with **non**\-Russians as mobiks in their medieval-grade ideas about warfare which exploits how ""quantity is its own quality"".

For the Russians though, there has been *no* problem using **non**\-Russians at scale in warfare - especially when these non-Russians are in the vanguard to be bullet-sponges. Not even the Germans and Japanese were this depraved by using POWs (or foreign civilians) as meat shields in their campaigns. The last time this tactic was widely used was during the МоngоІ campaigns 800 years ago. It should be no surprise then that the МоngоІѕ' most loyal ~~collaborators~~ *bootlickers* from Muscovy have emulated the tactic in the present-day, no matter how hard Russians keep insisting on their ""European"" and ""Christian"" credentials.

This is also linked to postwar Russians' deranged flex and gross attempt to fish for external sympathy by shedding counterfeit tears about their oh-so-sacred ancestors suffering more than 25 million casualties in WW II.

They deliberately cover up how the oh-so-precious and oh-so-peaceful ethnic Russians got off quite lightly [compared to the Ukrainians and Belarusians when looking at the depopulation of each ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#Soviet_Union). If you'd believe the Russians' insufferably sob story, you'd think that more than 25 million *Russians* died when the truth reveals how shamelessly and routinely the Russians have appropriated and stolen *anything* from **non**\-Russians be it tangible like land, money or women, or intangible like culture, dignity or victimhood.",2025-07-14T23:29:38

This disgusting example of a [Putinversteher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putinversteher) is merely proclaiming out loud her deranged loyalty to Russia and Russians, as reinforced by being a photographer who has worked in Russia for several years running despite her German origins and upbringing.

The NYT also has a history of cheering on or excusing the Russians when they're ~~exterminating~~ ""protecting"" Ukrainians.

I read the piece and it has some insightful observations, such as Russia sending soldiers through an aired out gaspipe to ambush Ukranians, which is a reminder that the Russians are not iditiots, but also that they are cruel -- many of the soldiers were poisened and will likely have long term issues from inhaling gas for days on end. Etc.  


For the Russians, no matter how rich, poor, (un)educated or (іІ)ІіbеrаІ they are, the *cruelty is the point*. Bonus points to be awarded when inflicting that culturally-acceptable cruelty on **non**\-Russians like the Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars, Georgians et al.

&gt;There are also frustrating bits about Russians blaming NATO for the war, which is a reminder of how ~~brainwashed~~ **wilfully deluded** the Russian people are.

FTFY

The Russian people have by their own volition incinerated the privilege of getting the benefit of the doubt from the civilized world because ""muh PrOpAgAnDa"".

They know the truth but in their uniquely spineless way, choose to dig into [learned helplessness](https://granta.com/russia-verge-nervous-breakdown/) to make themselves feel better about closing their eyes to their depravity and running away from the truth. I'll leave it to a Russian dissident to spit out facts about the utter moral bankruptcy and irredeemable civic *uselessness* of her ethnic kin.

&gt;*In Russia, the opposition will not stand in opposition. Citizens will not stand up for civic rights.* ***The Russian people suffer from a victim complex: they believe that nothing depends on them, and by them nothing can be changed.***

&gt;*‘It’s always been so’, they say, signing off on their civic impotence. The economic dislocation of the nineties, the cheerless noughties, and now President Vladimir Putin’s iron rule – with its fake elections, corrupt bureaucracy, monopolization of mass media, political trials and ban on protest – have inculcated a feeling of total helplessness. People do not vote in elections: ‘They’ll choose for us anyway;’ they don’t attend public demonstrations: ‘They’ll be dispersed anyway;’ they don’t fight for their rights: ‘We’re alive, and thank god for that.’*

&gt;*A 140-million-strong population exists in a somnambulistic state, on the verge of losing the last trace of their survival instinct. They hate the authorities, but have a pathological fear of change. They feel injustice, but cannot tolerate activists. They hate bureaucracy, but submit to total state control over all spheres of life. They are afraid of the police, but support the expansion of police control.* ***They know they are constantly being deceived, but believe the lies fed to them on television.***",2025-07-15T04:09:06

Some stories are lucky enough to capture both.

Yevhen Lyr ([eugene\_lir](https://www.instagram.com/eugene_lir/?hl=en)) is a Ukrainian writer, translator, volunteer, and soldier. His story is closely tied to the 2023 Russian sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine — one of the most devastating war crimes Moscow committed during the full-scale invasion.

Lyr witnessed the aftermath of the flood firsthand: first as a volunteer helping civilians, then as a serviceman stationed in Kherson for a year. That dual perspective shaped “The Flood” — an English-language novel that blends real stories, fiction, and the often-overlooked spirit of Ukraine’s south, in what he calls a book of love.

While ANCIENT china did invent a anumber of things which were fairly significant, the country has become what is basically a leech on the modern world.

Seriously, what significant modern invention or technological advancement has come out of china?

Their military is completely inferior to the west from everything from weapons to aircraft to ships. The automotive industry was invented by the west and the main players now are Japan, Korea, and the west. Computers and the internet were invented by the west. Every significant milestone in terms of space exploration / discovery was made by the west. Despite chinas best efforts, spartphone technology is still being led by korea and the states. In terms of household electronics Korea and the west are dominating. Japan korea and the states are dominating the media industry.

I could go on and on.

After Ukraine liberated Lyman in 2022, residents revealed how they had survived occupation in cellars without proper living conditions — an ordeal shared by countless Ukrainians in occupied territories, and one that will persist if the Kremlin retains control over these lands.

My pet conspiracy is that they side with russia not just because of blindly wanting to oppose 'the West', but russia had to have been paying off the local crash investigators or government authorities to make them look the other way. Every Malaysian book or article discussing MH17 toes their official narrative in saying that either the perpetrator is impossible to determine or that 'the West' has a vested interest in taking Ukraine's side in the issue. It's tragic and does no justice to the victims.

However, while such tribunals primarily focus on military crimes, there is another group of perpetrators whose influence is vast but often underestimated — the propagandists.  
  
In this post, we explore whether Russian propagandists can be held responsible for inciting genocide — and what challenges stand in the way of bringing the Kremlin’s mouthpieces to justice.

1liolxd,The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace,enocenip,228,2025-06-23T18:38:06,jesterboyd,20,"Just read this on FB:

&gt;I no longer write posts in English about the latest shelling and destruction in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. I realized that what hurts and burns me at first horrified Europeans, but over time they got used to it. For me, these are the children of my friends sleeping on subway cars or in the bathroom. These are destroyed buildings on such familiar streets of my hometown. Cities where the tragedies of strangers are perceived as our own. Do you know what the scariest thing about tragedy is? Its routinization. Seven dead, five dead, ten wounded. Translated into English, it's just statistics. Sad statistics of Ukrainian life. Horror that is already perceived as the norm.

&gt;The further I go, the less I believe they will understand us. No one will understand what it's like to stay up at night, covering children with your body. What it's like when it flies into your neighbors. How it blows out windows. How floors crumble. Life is falling apart like dust. They won't understand. Even such simple, obvious and terribly terrible things, not to mention more subtle matters.

&gt;The other day, a new neighbor moved in next door to me. A young Russian woman. She was settled by the mayor's office of our town, under a social program, just like me. The only difference is that I ended up here because there is a war in my country. A war that her country unleashed. From which many people close to me died and are suffering. There is no war in her country (yet).

&gt;I asked in the chat room of German volunteers who have been helping Ukrainian refugees all these years, and besides - refugees from everywhere, whether there are really refugees from Russia in our district, and even if so - is it normal to settle us next door, because it's not really okay with me. 

&gt;In response, I received a lot of interesting things, such as quotes from the textbook Leben in Deutschland - about tolerance, helping everyone who needs it, and that not all Russians are necessarily evil, and suddenly this is a good Russian and why shouldn't I check it out. And in general, for us refugees, to have conflicts - in the hostel for asylum seekers, Africans and Syrians are always fighting. What kind of people. 

&gt;And then I understood! “Whatsthedifference” (aka “kakayarazitsa”) - a universal phenomenon. And there is no point in explaining that Africans and Syrians are not in a state of military conflict, and that domestic quarrels have nothing to do with existential conflict. And in general, there is probably no point in explaining anything. That is why this post is in Ukrainian. Like the post quoted below. It is for my own people - those who will understand.

&gt;"" Seven dead were found in the collapsed building. But that's not all. Andriy is standing in front of the house - under the concrete are his 11-year-old daughter Maria and his wife Svitlana. 

&gt;He smokes, drinks water, answers endless calls. And so it has been for more than seven hours. Someone hugs him, asks to talk for a minute. He refuses. 

&gt;He stands and crosses himself. 

&gt;Svitlana and Masha lived on the third floor. Now there is the most debris there and rescuers are removing layer by layer with their hands. 

&gt;The boys are running around - Masha's classmates. They are here with their parents, they lived in neighboring houses, which were also damaged. 

&gt;A Russian Iskander hit the house on Dorohozhychi after four in the morning. 

&gt;There was a resounding alarm, people were returning from shelters. Then the alarm went off again and in two minutes part of the house collapsed. 

&gt;Maria and Svitlana were found dead 12 hours after the explosion.",2025-06-23T21:36:56

It reminds me of the post-WW2 anger of the French that lead us to pursue a Nuclear Program.

Following this, if Ukraine also pursues a nuclear program, it is only a justified echo of France.

Ukraine has been arguing that it is being a shield for Europe. It is of course part rhetoric to garner support, but it is nonetheless true.

I have great admiration for Ukraine, I think in a way it is the new Revolutionary France of our time.

Maybe it is silly of me but for example I saw [the song of Ukraine ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4N82wPpdg8)at Eurovision and I found it very inspiring.

1liolxd,The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace,enocenip,228,2025-06-23T18:38:06,petecslmao,3,"A very interesting article. From my perspective in the farthest Western Europe, with daily interaction with Ukrainian people. It’s a lot of text in the article for discussion but here are some notes.

""inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians.""

A large part of the West (at least where I live) does see both as very similar, but there are also people who see them as a different and independent people (me and many other people). What are the arguments of those who don’t see them that way? History and the fact that many of them speak Russian daily outside of Ukraine here.

""Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence""

Totally agree with this, but there are many people who are tired of politicians and their policies in their countries regarding how they handle corruption and money, and this has an impact on this. However, I don’t think anyone blames ordinary Ukrainian civilians for anything.

""Such ignorance can be intentional""

Thats a fact, a lot of people simply don't care about what happens in Ukraine because they are feeling safe and its not ""their"" war. They carry on with their lives, dealing with their problems.

""The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied""

I don't think this is true at all, maybe im wrong but i don't see Ukrainian people like that. Maybe quiet, close and cold at first but thats normal when they are in a new country where they don't speak the language, for example.

""they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions""

This is normal nowadays, it does happen with everybody even inside our countries with our own people.

""Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation. "" 

They are not forgotten or unwanted, but those people need to show them, right?

I believe there is a lot of misinformation in some Western countries due to language barriers, simply not knowing people from Ukraine or simply not caring at all.",2025-06-24T17:13:15

This harsh principle became a bitter reality for many Ukrainians during the Soviet era, when Russian colonialism sought to erase Ukrainian identity in every possible way.  
  
Years later, the Russians still employ these methods, relentlessly shelling and bombing Ukrainian cities, villages, and even cemeteries over the last decade.  
  
In this post, we shed light on how Russia is destroying graveyards across Ukraine, aiming to strip Ukrainians of their history and sever the nation’s connection to its roots.

All of the sanctions Russia is feeling now should have been on since Russia invaded Crimea.

I think the reason it wasn’t was because we have an industrial complex that was dying after withdrawing from Afghanistan and Covid, etc…  a speedy resolution was less attractive than firing up industry to make shells, tanks and artillery just like China has been doing in preparation for invading Taiwan.  We also saw an opportunity to ween Germany off of Russian energy. Something that various administrations have worked on and wasn’t ready at the time of the Crimean invasion.

I feel like the slow escalation was working at the detriment of both Ukraine and Russia people.  But Ukraine was finally getting access to long range weapons it needed to disrupt supply chains and push back.

With the current US administration, if Russia nuked Kyiv, I am less sure what the response would be.  Before, I assumed that would mean Russia would lose most of their nuclear capabilities overnight.  Now, I think there would be some kind of international meeting and resolution that would give most or all of Ukraine to Russia in the name of peace.

Having Russia think that they can diplomatically take over Ukraine keeps them from scorched earth decimation across the country.  

Europe needs to step up and end this.  If you can’t make your own artillery fast enough, buy it from the US.  This is a win-win since a developed and democratic Ukraine will be a huge engine for mutual growth and prosperity of Europe.

Do I actually think Russia will try to invade Europe?  No.  But the advantage Europe would have if they end up with a European Ukraine is completely worth the effort, imho.

Don’t forget.  If Russia takes over Ukraine, those Ukrainian soldiers we helped train become Russian soldiers.  Even the threat of invasion of the former Soviet states by this expanded army will result in their immediate capture.

Most Americans I know want an immediate surge in the support of Ukraine.  Giving just enough to support to maintain battle lines has been awful and expensive.  I think those that oppose this support, might see a united new Europe as a huge threat to USA in terms of trade.  I think they might have a point as well.",2025-06-14T12:09:11

Myroslav Marynovych is a Ukrainian philosopher, a former political prisoner during the Soviet era, and one of the founders of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group.  
  
In this post, we share Myroslav Marynovych’s key points on why the West fails to grasp the essence of the Russian war and fears its collapse, as well as why the Russian opposition has been unable to protect the country from authoritarianism.

While the scale of destruction was staggering, the tactic was far from new. It followed a familiar pattern: targeting civilian infrastructure and deliberately inflicting harm — something Russia has repeated across Ukraine countless times.  The Kakhovka dam explosion reveals a broader strategy behind Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine.

Russia’s population isn’t that much larger than Japan’s &amp; it’s less than half the size of the Soviet Union’s at its peak. Russia is the largest country in the world if you’re just counting acreage. It’s almost the same size as any two of the next three largest countries combined.

Most of that acreage is barely populated, however.

Canada, China &amp; the US are all pretty close if we’re just talking about physical size. Russia has almost twice as much land as any of those countries. Its population is only 1/10 the size of China’s, however, and only about 40% of America’s. It does have a considerably higher population density than Canada, but Canada is even less hospitable to human life than Russia. 

The idea that Putin has hordes of men to call upon is one of those zombie myths that just won’t die.

The truth is that Russia is rich in land but desperately power as far as people are concerned. Male life expectancy in Russia is about 65-67 years depending on what source you use.

Russia can't keep affording to pay these military salaries and death bonuses to the families. They're promised what is a fortune (to them) to sign up. Why do you think russia leave their dead on the battlefield? No body = no proof = no death bonus. The only reason they want them picked up off the front now is that their own soldiers are falling over the fallen bodies on their way to the front and eventually it's going to cause all sorts of disease as the weather warms up. Also according to zelensky russia are returning their own soldiers bodies to ukraine pretending theyre ukrainian fallen soldiers in military body swaps as another way to get rid of their soldiers. And they're already charging the new recruits big money ""for their equipment"" so they dont get paid what they were promised anyway. And we've probably all seen the despicable way they treat their soldiers.

Ukrainian soldiers are fighting to save their fellow countrymen, their families, and the honour of their land and people. This is why they fight so hard and can defend against these seemingly unlrelenting meat waves of mostly low educated rural russians who did not think they were signing up for the brutality they got, but have shown themselves to be capable of evil actions when tasked to it and would rather 'off' themselves than surrender, because their own commander would do it to them if they retreated anyway.",2025-06-04T20:43:01

Latest update by Prune60 on their NWF. Their sum liquid assets dropped from 8,2 trillion rubles at the start of the war to 2,8 trillion rubles at 31st of last May. 

That only tells half the story though as their reserves in dollars, Japanese yen and euro's have disappeared. What they have left are yuan and gold. The gold is in there for a value that likely doesn't correspond with reality as they have trouble selling it off.

Another thing to consider is that Russia always has a huge end-of-the-year decrease in the NWF as they pay for stuff. Last year it dropped near 2 trillion at 31-12.

After the Aghan war just a few tens of thousands of ""Afghanski's"" came back from wounded and mangled from that failed invasion. The burden on society is largely seen as one of the things that caused the soviet unions authoritarian regime to collapse. Imagine now, when Russia has less than half the population the soviet union did, now there are 100's of thousands of mangled and wounded men coming from an unjustified war of genocidal conquest that will be a humiliating defeat. Russia is going to get weighed down to death. Roughly 30x the casualties with .5 the population so 60x the problem you had after the afghan war. And this is still going. Thats if Russia stopped now. Meanwhile in all of the territories east of the Ural mountains in that vast space you use to claim you are the largest country, you have around 6 million poor and mistreated minorities with scattered ethnic russian who were moved there during the soviet days. Right across the border hundreds of millions of chinese citizens who need the fresh water and resources. Russia is grinding itself down on a front that it never was at risk at.

The point was not WW2, GDP. It was just, that's just how it is in war, when you mobilise your entire economy, you mobilise your entire economy, and that leads to about 30-40%.

""Russia literally announced their plan to take over Ukraine. “3 days to Kyiv” was literally their slogan. So why wouldn’t they spend more money to reach that goal?""

Well why do that? 7% is working in Putin's eyes. So why increase it when you're going to win?

There's also a political and economic ramifications that come with that, and I can't asked to list them all, basically:

International isolation  
Much stronger response from the West  
Russian economy goes down a lot quicker  
Very few people in Russia support such a mobilisation  
And it would only harden Ukrainian resistance against Russia  
As well as also giving away to the Russians that it's not an SVO.

""Also….do you actually watch russian channels? Where are you getting your information from?""

Purely from just assuming.

Any country can go to war economy, anyone, it's not hard, you just spend all your money on war. So, Russia's spending about 6.143% being precise, and that is two times what Ukraine is spending on her defence, which Ukraine is spending about 70 billion dollars a year on her defence, which is 37% of her economy.

Russia is at 6.143,

1. How is the 7% working? Their original goal wasnt met and they had trouble along the way. Russia is having trouble maintaining the territory they’re occupying, not to mention gaining any new territory. That was never the goal…the goal was to occupy the majority of Ukraine and specifically take over the Ukrainian government…again “Kyiv in 3 days” rhetoric that was all over Russian news during the outbreak of the war. So there goes your argument of “why spend more than they need to”. The support for the war in Russia is dwindling bc it's impacting their economy, international standing of their citizens, and costing lives. Estimated 1M lives. And you’re saying that Russia doesn't need to end the war on their end? Lol

2. Britain WW2 spending example doesn’t make sense. Ok it was 30% of their GDP. What did they spend it on? The majority was on land-lease where uk got weapons from other countries like the US. Russia has a limited amount of allies that would make the same deal with them. So even if they wanted to mobilize their economy, they would be limited in effective ways to do so. Developing your own weapons takes time and resources. 

3. Same point of “if the could they would” argument. Your list of political ramifications may be true for using nuclear weapons, but not much more. What Russians are doing in Ukraine is genocide. They’re raping, pillaging and murdering indiscriminately and quite frankly the political ramifications are limited.

4. “Giving away to Russians this is not a SVO” lol this is how I know you don't understand anything about russia. Russians will believe what they’re told to believe. Even if they know better, they don't care. “Very few people support such a mobilization “  Exactly. You can’t just spend more money, you need a way to do so. 

[Here is an article to help you understand the toll of war](https://apple.news/Ay9qqo7yEQwiPehom4mErMQ)

Honestly I have such a hard time understanding where you’re coming from. Your stance and arguments are not logical and even a bit of critical thought would unravel them. Taking 1 data point (from the 1940s) and surrounding an argument around that is absurd. 

And to use that “logic” as to why “Russia would win this war if they wanted” and imply that help from the West would be useless. Dude Russia wants to win….that’s the whole point.

My logic is:

Russia has resources, therefore, Russia could go to a war economy, and that, would not be good for Ukraine, and that's why the West is scared of escalation.

I do not get why that's confusing. 

""How is the 7% working?""

***Putin*** thinks it is. Keyword, ***Putin*** thinks it is.

""And you’re saying that Russia doesn't need to end the war on their end?""

I have never brought that up as a piece of the argument I'm making because it's completely redundant to my point. The war does need to end with Russia leaving, but that does not correlate to me saying, Russia could go to a war economy and that's why the West is scared of them.

""That was never the goal…the goal was to occupy the majority of Ukraine and specifically take over the Ukrainian government…again “Kyiv in 3 days” rhetoric that was all over Russian news during the outbreak of the war. So there goes your argument of “why spend more than they need to”.

Putin thinks he's at war with NATO, so, of course it's going to be slow, in his eyes, that's obvious. He thinks he's at war with NATO, so if he can beat Ukraine, he can claim Russia can beat NATO.

""Britain WW2 spending example doesn’t make sense. Ok it was 30% of their GDP. What did they spend it on?""

Their defence.

""The majority was on land-lease where uk got weapons from other countries like the US.""

A good chunk of that was spent on lend lease, but the majority of it was spent on Britain's defence.

""Russia has a limited amount of allies that would make the same deal with them.""

It doesn't matter how many do it, if a nation decides that they want to make an ammunition factory in Russia, then that ammunition factory is going to happen. It would be very useful for Russia because they wouldn't need to then expand their already existing ammunition factories.

""So even if they wanted to mobilize their economy, they would be limited in effective ways to do so. Developing your own weapons takes time and resources.""

Yes that is true, but a war economy allows that to happen a lot quicker.

To give an example, at the beginning of WW2, some nations used Bi-planes, by 1945, most nations were transitioning to jet planes. 

""Same point of “if the could they would” argument. Your list of political ramifications may be true for using nuclear weapons, but not much more. What Russians are doing in Ukraine is genocide.

I started writing a story more than a decade ago which included the same scenario. Ryan McBeth wrote about almost this exact scenario in his recent book, detailing how vulnerable military assets are within the borders of a country. Both the UK and the US have experienced suspicious drone activity, either attacking infrastructure or (potentially/alleged) sabotaging commercial travel. Over the last few years Finland, Sweden and Norway have all experienced similar threats to installations.

None of this should be a surprise to anyone, and the fact our governments have been caught with their pants down should lead to a thorough spanking.

I'm not claiming no one in our governments/military had the common-sense to see this coming, or that they lacked the required imagination to be able to predict it, but clearly there has been some kind of lack of foresight/action here. Someone dropped the ball, and whether that's in the imagination stage, the assessment stage, or the development stage, those involved should all be embarrassed.

And I'm fully with you, OP. If our stupid governments had done what they should have done at the start, this would have been over within a few months, and it wouldn't have reached this point. Instead, they forgot the phrase ""Necessity is the mother of invention"" and they forgot our own history in which we made remarkable developments during WW2.

Our nations allowed this to continue, and this is the result. Our arrogant leaders underestimated Ukrainian abilities over and over and over again. Our nations have been historically so high on our own romanticized notions of historical heroism, we believe we're better than everyone else and didn't think Ukraine had the same abilities.

(To clarify, I'm speaking of those in power. I think most citizens of our nations fully respect Ukrainian ingenuity and ability.)

Well, now we're stuck in a difficult place where Ukraine has had no choice but to unleash a Pandora's Box of possibilities.

And now I find myself wondering what else Ukraine has up its sleeve that the rest of the world will be surprised by. Will our leaders finally work out that we should help to end this now with conventional means, or will they again all sit back and deliver piecemeal nonsense, only to be shocked once more when Ukraine releases another ""unboxing"" video?

Sadly, given how stupid so many of those in power are - and have been for a long time - I fully expect them to do nothing again, and for them to be blind sided when Ukraine delivers another means of attack to the world that our so-called ""experts"" didn't have the intellect or imagination to predict.",2025-06-04T09:07:45

But let's also have some understanding for Ukrainians. I think some anger towards the situation is justified. They are living in war, they are losing relatives. And of course if you then see your allies dragging their feet, it would make you angry. And especially now that Trump is providing even less aid than Biden.

Ukrainians have had to sacrifice so much. But I've also seen many messages of gratefulness for the assistance they DID get in this sub.

I would very much like our leaders to do more. I've even been sending messages to the EU about it. But I think the whole debt problem in Europe is part of the issue. 

Regardless, I understand the frustration and it's clear to see it's directed at our leaders, not our people. So let's not get our feelings hurt by someone venting their justified frustration. How would you feel if you were a Ukrainian?

Also: the aid is not charity. I honesty believe Ukraine's fighting is actually protecting Europe too. It's clear that Putin wants to restore the Russian empire and maybe take a bit more for good measure. So we should try to support Ukraine as much as we can.

I would assume that no-one else had knowledge of this attack before hand either, at least I see no reports suggesting that Ukraine's other allies had knowledge or even supported the planning and attack. But on the same hand I haven't seen such emphatic denial from anyone else 

So it makes me wonder, why has the news and social media been flooded with denials of prior involvement coming out of the whitehouse? Who does that benefit? And who is it for?

It would be nice to believe that it's simply a matter of American leadership trying to maintain a neutral position as negotiator. But we don't see those same denials coming out of the whitehouse after russian attacks.

The use of drones in warfare is already in constant review, even before this event. This mission was mostly an shocking logistical succes, more then an technology one. But the fact that the war in Ukraine is changing warfare, that is already well established. 

In politics you have to remember that there is no single view on support for Ukraine. Some parties are constantly pushing for more support, while others want to put an lower budget on all foreign support. I don't think the parties that want to support Ukraine have miscalculated anything. As they have been saying from the start that Ukraine can win. And the parties that are against support are indeed silent about the topic. In fact the biggest one in our country (PVV) is too busy on letting our government fall and cause re-elections.  

So yea, Ukraine did cause an silence among their critics.",2025-06-04T10:34:34

a) Pakistan vs India. Two nuclear countries at odds. Noice
b) Israel and Gaza. If that’s not enough of a shit show already.
c) China vs Taiwan. Nuff said.
d) US domestically, cartels, college students, rogue VA layoff workers
f) on the high seas. yummy.😋

Then you have the old-school Western leftists (the rather aged SPD being a prime example for that, many of those still having too much a say in the party had a lot of contacts to GDR and UdSSR officials before 1990), who, too, were spoonfed Kremlin-propaganda, indirectly via the anti-US-American tune most if not all old-school Western leftists sang (and mostly still sing) to, which automatically defines Russian atrocieties and wars (if perceived at all) as the ""lesser evil"". Then you have those (mostly right and center and economic liberals/libertarians) who earn(ed) neatly from petro-based (and/or other) business with Russia.

I do want to say that I don't agree with ""the West"", I think it's a bit easy to put Europe and the US in the same spot, we're not. While the EU is slow to react, which isn't helping, the US acting against you and breaking the Budapest Treaty is another level. 

As for myself, I know nothing about war, I'm spoiled. I'm in awe with the determination of Ukraine and how they achieve so much with so little. It's truly something to be proud of and I hope we can learn. 

Now regarding the silence, I've noticed this too. I cannot talk for the US, but my suspicion is in the EU it's due to deescalation. I think the EU has changed tactics and is supporting Ukraine from the inside out, but they've probably asked Ukraine to keep quiet. All the uproar from Frump is doing more harm than good. It's about winning, not a trophy. This might however just be wishful thinking and incredibly naive. But something is going on if you ask me.

Plenty of us were screaming that Putin's nuclear threats 100% needed to be treated as a bluff. The day the Kharkiv offensive took place was the day the west should have flooded Ukraine with weapons to push the russians out once and for good. Instead, after the awe was over, the fear of eSCaLaTioN crept back. Those of us who were screaming for more, Zelensky included, were told repeatedly that the drip feeding policy was 100% fine and by doing this we are ""keeping the conflict contained so we do not have to send out children to die one day in the future"".

Except...that entire drip feed policy has crept us closer than ever to a world-wide conflict. I 100% believe that had Biden and his team shown some actual muscle and provided the FULL support Ukraine needed, the Dems could have used that as a launching pad for Harris to win the presidency. What a wave of patriotism that would be; finally the bad red army has been defeated, shamed and never allowed to invade another country again. All for pennies on the dollar, *not a single American soldier's life lost*, all handed on a silver platter. But now, we are stuck with a POTUS that has shit all over literally every single ally the USA has built over the past century, and he's not done yet. A weakened NATO that looks more fragile than ever where it seems like a given that the US will NOT come to the aid if called upon. The stability and leadership the USA has provided to the Western world is cracking and one day, some country somewhere will start some shit that will drag us all in, mark my words. What's that, talks of taking over Greenland or even f'ing Canada? I can't imagine Harris doing something like that. If only she had won, right?

Ukraine being given what they asked for, when the asked for it, being allowed to use it how they see fit would have resulted in conventional war staying exactly that way; conventional. Instead, we now get to witness the birth of the drone era of war in which the 2 countries that are by far the most advanced in that kind of warfare, get to test it in true battlefield scenarios. This isn't US drones chasing cavemen in mountains where 20 operators sit in a room and peacefully sip coffee while they launch attacks at a wedding. This is the future of war, of terrorism, on display and once again we can thank the policy of eSCaLaTioN management for allowing this kind of progress to be made. 

What I have learned is that if a nuclear-armed country wants nuclear proliferation to be a thing, you'd better step the fuck up and help other countries who have abided by your policy (in this case, Ukraine) of disarming and help them when they need it. And it should be done in such a way that other countries watch what happens and think twice before waving their own nukes around and invading another. A quick swift victory against the russians would have sent a strong message to China to think twice about about attacking Taiwan, lest you feel the swift axe of the west. Instead...it's a ticking time bomb and once again with Trump in power, it's not certain that the USA will come to Taiwan's rescue.

After living in the aftermath of this attack on russia's nuclear bomber fleet, we can now use the power of hindsight to see just how the dominos have fallen ever since escalation management has led us to this stage. The frustrating part is that this was all entirely preventable, predictable, and those in power simply kept kicking the can down the road. The desire to keep your children and their children out of conflict, is in fact turned upside down, and for many it seems closer than ever. Especially for those that live within the sphere of American imperialist ambitions, and a fractured NATO alliance, thanks to a president who is very clearly on the Orc's side. One who would likely not be power right now had his predecessor shown more courage in the face of threats and shown his people that his side was worthy of their vote by defeating their eternal enemy, all for pennies on the dollar.",2025-06-04T19:32:47

We should never expect anyone to help us work anything, even if their own survival depends on our success. 


We shouldn't expect anyone to give us anything for free or even sell us anything when they smell the profit.


And we shouldn't forget any deeds - good or bad - that were done when we were in need. 


Western allies value words and their own lives very much. We in Ukraine know the true price of human life - it is much less that western people pretend it to be. And we know the price of words, precisely, because words worth nothing. 


We can only trust the actions, and there were very few actions compared to a stockpile of words. And we found some friends along the way, who share our blood. I mean people, individuals, not the amorphous 'nation'. Right people, in the wrong places, can change the world.

There is a balance to be reached in communication about this. I was talking and writing about it with friends and colleagues. So it's not like it's been unseen.  

But we also know that after every succesful operation vs high value military target, ruzzians target civilians en masse. So even though it's tempting to play on our noses towards ruzzia, it is not our place to do so. It'd be like a chick on the sidelines of a brawl egging the opponent on. 

One thing that is true - we're again shockingly surprised and unprepared to this ""development"". Hats off to AFU&amp;SBU on execution but the idea? How tf are we shocked, again?     
Since this year we've even changed the law to enforce authorizing all drone flights. There's a new fine and everything.  Our flight agency has the tool to set our drone's ass down or to return to point of start at moment's notice. But I've noticed multiple times in last weeks  that people fly over restricted zones and they don't call it in in Drone Tower and... nothing. Maybe someone seeks  the fine, but that's just silly afterthought that ought to be nothing more than deterrent. The real response should be forcing a landing, and then if you can't do that - that's when you know you're dealing with imminent danger. 

  
This  is one of the ways Ukrainians are helping to keep us safe - we get to adjust to these innovations without actively fighting a war which among other things makes command more rigid.  

PS.: as a lazy motherfucker myself, I've got to wonder: what do you think your post achieves? I spend non trivial amount of time arguing against YOUR POINTS but with people who are opposed to our help to Ukraine.

2. Russia targets civilians in Ukraine systematically. The fact that you’ve convinced yourself Russia acts in a retaliatory manner is aberration of informational space and a cognitive error. Every day Russia destroys houses and apartments with KABs, missiles and drones. You just cherry pick attacks to fit your narrative.
3. As a Ukrainian civilian I say target me instead of my military all day and all night long! My life is worth a lot less than a life of a trained, experienced soldier. The fact that the enemy is mainly focusing on terror tactics tells you all you need to know about state of affairs of the Russian military. The thing is, when you’re holding someone’s head underwater, they’ll often bite and claw at you, forgoing all rules of engagement. The point is to keep holding them under no matter what.
4. Electronics counter measures won’t save you if they use fiber optics.
5. I have no idea what you’re on about in your last paragraph, mate. 
I am a huge movie nerd and in directing a movie there’s this wonderful rule called “Show don’t tell”. If I know something about Zelenskyy is that we both learned about it from the same drama master. Both Russia and our Western allies have turned out to be an amazing audience for “Show don’t tell” performances, responsive and attentive. If you think robotics are our only aces you ain’t seen nothing yet.

For the EU, it just means that bragging about UA's success brings nothing to the help UA. Bragging would would feed the narrative of Putin that NATO wants to attack RU.

From what I see here in French media, the mood is quite celebratory and praising Ukraine's ingenuity.

[See for yourself!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSRZf1HMW8) (you can activate the auto-translation if needed)

Although there is the expected whining from Philipot, one of the far-right Putin sock-puppets.

I share your frustration. I'm even in favor of Ukraine getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it may be. I guess it's because I see a reflection of our suffering during WWII in your current suffering. It made us go ""never again"", getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it was at the time, and pursuing a strategy of military autonomy up to this day, as controversial as it also has been.

That being said, I don't like being lumped together with the US under the umbrella term of ""The West"", and drawing blanket statement about us from it. Especially now that it's so fractured, with Trump saying things like ""The EU was created to screw over the US"", wanting to seize Canada and Greenland, it seems the US caught the fascist disease, like Russia.

And for all that this term of ""The West"" is worth, Ukraine is now part of it, isn't it? Or at least part of the EU bloc as a Candidate country, which is more important than many realise. Ukraine's genius hasn't been only in the battlefield, but also in the political sphere. The Zelensky government has positioned Ukraine, not as a lesser country begging for missiles and external help, but as a hero of Europe, a leader and defender. Seemingly with the complicity and support of many EU leaders. Pretty much everyone in Europe now knows the motto of ""Slava Ukraini! Heroim Slava!"" This is rooted in the true glory of Ukraine, but I don't think it spread this far just by accident. Some even say that Ukraine is now the new leader of the ""Free World"", and in heart I agree.

As cruel as it may be in this cruel world, a ""self-actualised"" Ukraine doesn't get to complain about ""the West"". You are part of the West now, you are now the ""France of the East"", you are a leader who has to play with the hand you have been dealt with, we Europeans are the imperfect hand you have been given, but at least it's not ""you have no cards"" as the other would say.

We Europeans believed we achieved forever peace and mothballed our military. We were caught with our pants down. On the plus side, now that we are rearming, we can invest heavily in drone warfare just like Ukraine, you can guide us in that, we can together create the EU army of the future.

We have failed to provide you with enough weapons, but in many cases it wasn't that we were sitting on big stockpiles refusing to give it away, we didn't have much really.

But at least we have a lot of money lol, we've invested a lot of money in keeping Ukraine up and working, and in your military, to develop your own weapons, our weapons for the future.

As far as the EU is concerned, we depend on you as much as you depend on us. We are not the West as opposed to Ukraine. We are in this together. Your victories are our victories. If they are causing ""deep shock"" for the world, good. We are Europe, Europa Universalis. Apparently we've been too nice and the world has forgotten the monster we were.

Trump is terrified of nuclear weapons because he is an idiot who cannot understand them and is to arrogant to ask those of us that do.

The American people in general are more like European teenagers but with less intelligence. For all of Americas accomplishments they have never really been under real stress. They don't get really exposed to war or privation. They don't really suffer poverty(American poverty is wealth in the rest of the world). In general, their lives are to good to make them fight for anything with any real risk to their lives.

As to governments... it's.. complicated.   
In every metric it is better to help Ukraine for the western world.. but there is also a few with real fear of Ukraine too at the heights of power. Ukraine could easily become Russia 2.0 in these peoples minds. Even if the concept is absurd to a Ukrainian the fear of a powerful unified nation with a modern army and a different way of thinking skews things. Then there is also the might makes right crowd that stupidly agrees with the Russian way of doing things. 

TLDR until the war hits home for Americans.. they'll continue to just be ""situationally interested"" for the greater majority.",2025-06-04T18:03:35

The reason everybody is silent is because Ukraine have fundamentally changed the nature of warfare with this attack. They've demonstrated that no part of the world is safe from this new form of hybrid warfare and that will shake the core of the great powers. 
The second and related reason is the idea of mutually assured destruction. It relies on the fact that nuclear armed nations have the capacity to annihilate each other if a nuclear war were to start. This extends not only to nations nuclear arsenals, but also their defence against the nuclear arsenal of another nation. If you can demonstrate that you can defend yourself against a nuclear attack from another nation or you can pre-emptively cripple your adversaries arsenal before they're able to launch a strike it paradoxically moves the entire world closer to that precipice. Ukraine directly attacking the delivery systems of Russia's nuclear arsenal shows that not only their but also every nuclear armed nations arsenal is now vulnerable to relatively cheap and widely available weapons that smaller nations and even some terrorist groups are fully capable of utilising against them.

I’d argue the west is involved. Ukraine did this yes, but the logistics involved likely had european/american help here.

1. I’m not taking away from Ukraine, I believe we’re simply supplying/assisting and training.

2. I really don’t like Trump and i’m livid at how he treated Zelensky. But isn’t the timing strange? Ukraine was likely pressured as we all witnessed, to be quiet and to not pull off any further substantial attacks. Especially ones that would seek to humiliate Putin which Ukraine is so damn good at. Trump wanted to be in full control of anything that might threaten peace talks.
However after Ukraine signed the minerals deal and did all that Trump said, it became clear to Trump that Russia was the only one not playing ball. Something we all knew but he didn’t because he’s an idiot. 

I think because of this, Trump has given Ukraine the go ahead to start biting back again to force Putin to the table seriously. The issue is that Putin doesn’t want to legitimize Zelensky. He has paraded him on Russian media as a terrorist and an illigitimate leader. He also sees Zelensky as below him with no real power and therefore not his equal. He wants to discuss these talks with Trump and only Trump. If Zelensky and Putin are to be in the same room it would be with Trump. Putin is evil and very cunning.

The timings of the attack right before the 2nd round of talks is telling though. Especially since Russia snubbed the first round. They got a taste of their own medicine. You want strength and cunning power? Ukraine can rise to the occassion.

Lastly, this is just an opinion based on my observations. I say that because it is highly possible Ukraine just said “F this, Trump is getting us nowhere and it’s making things worse”. I just know that Zelensky has countless times put his own percieved image on the line for the US and Europe etc to politically/diplomatically get things done by the book so we are all kept on the right side of history and not stooping to Russia’s level of degenerecy, showing once again that our system of life is far superior despite it’s failings.

I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch to believe that. Britian for example has been involved in trainning up Ukrainian saboteurs previously.

Ukraine had to be trainned from the ground up. The country went from civillians making molitovs in the streets to launching himars and naval drones at airbases, oil and weapons depots and attack boats and blowing up bridges. They didn’t just sprout a plethora of skill and capability from nowhere with a mostly civillian army.

This makes the least sense. Ukraine as a former member of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union with a huge Russian speaking population is almost uniquely qualified to infiltrate Russia. I can't think of literally anything that foreign intelligence services could teach them.

If you can’t think of anything foreign intelligence can teach them you’re slightly overestimating what Ukraine has accomplished on their own. Like I said they didn’t have much before western involvement and couldn’t have done this without their weapons and trainning. 

Knowing about the KGB is helpful but trying to apply these sophisticated attacks in the middle of a battlefield is extremely complex and requires alot of moving parts to go right to get done. Ukraine wouldn’t be able to shift that gear into Russia over their own border would they? So they’d need to do it via other countries wouldn’t they?

Examine, if you will, the people Russia has targeted: Tatars, Bashkirs, Chukchis, Chechens, Circassians, the Chuvash, the Mari, Finns, Udmurts, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Georgians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, and so on. 

The horrible part? Some people (Ossetians and the Abkhaz in particular) have actually assisted Russia's ambitions. The Ossetians and the Ingush (an ethnic group closely related to Chechens) are at loggerheads with each other and Russia doesn't give a damn. 

The ironic part? Russia is gradually phasing out Ossetian. Many other minority languages in Russia are being phased out as well. 

Russia is on nobody's side; absolutely nobody's. And if you think Russia cares about anyone, you have another thing coming *in there*.",2025-05-19T03:02:29

What many don’t know is that by the time of the deportation, Crimean Tatars were already a minority in their own homeland, making up just 20–25% of the population — the result of centuries of systematic repression and waves of forced emigration.

Russia was estimated to have around 3,300 operational tanks. ...""  
And there were news like ""UK secret services **believe** Russia has n tanks"".  
I think believe was the right word, because not even the Russians knew how many tanks in which state they had.    
In late 2022 Peskov said that the telegrams have been sent that the mobilization has been finished.  
Telegrams aka ""cable"", not telegram. This was a way to communicate with the Russian army.  
So you can imagine how the bookkeeping for tanks is done there.  
In March/April 2022 a Russian general committed suicide. He was responsible for a tank storage site.  
Who knows how many interesting parts the ""mice"" have eaten away (or brought to a tourist flea market on Arbat in Moscow).  
.  
I don't know how I came across the story with the title:  
Танки в лесу, Свердловская область  
""Tanks in the forest. Sverdlovsk region"" (swalker ru, 2011)  
About 200 T-72(?) tanks were parked in a forest during planned redeployment for some weeks.  
Some residents discovered this and forwarded this to the press, because  
""working condition"", meaning that even if you don't shoot you can level villages as long as you have fuel ...  
And so the Russian army was disturbed in hibernation and had to move away the tanks faster than planned.  
Also here I wouldn't be sure whether all records were updated.  
There were some disruptive changes affecting the Russian army.  
First the 90s beginning with bringing back equipment from the former Warsaw Pact, and the 90s in itself,  
and then some reforms that led to abandoning a lot of objects (the mentioned website has a lot).  
This combined with Russian ""bookkeeping"" probably made it even for the Russian army to have an halfway  
exact estimation about equipment and state.  
But I guess it is more on the surprising low side, because you can make so many mistakes when storing tanks,  
uniforms, assault rifles, ...",2025-05-18T14:59:45

I can't work out whether you are winding us up or are simply very naive and ill informed.  As you say you are  part Russian I am sure that as a tourist you will either be very, very unwelcome and possibly at risk of violence from the population,  not allowed into the country at all, or at risk of arrest under suspicion of spying or being a saboteur. I cannot believe that you do not know what the civilian population of Ukraine has been subjected to over the last three years and more.  Every major city,  including Odesa, is under daily attack by drones, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, rocket artillery,  conventional artillery, and air-dropped munitions. Many thousands of Ukrainian civilians, including hundreds of children have been killed.  Thousands of children have been kidnapped and taken from their parents by Russia.Thousands of attacks have been made on innocent civilians- several hundred attacks and air raids have taken place during the last week alone, all over the country, including on the beautiful city of Odesa. To hear you say that you are vaguely aware that the Russian navy has occasionally shelled Odesa fills me with incredulity. You are living in tne UK for God's sake,, where there is totally uncensored media and access to the Internet, which allows you to research such information at the drop of a hat.  Have you been living in a cave on a remote mountain for the last few years? This isn't a minor squabble between two families living in the same street, you know?  Do you understand? This is the biggest war in Europe since 1945 and hundreds of thousands of people are dead as a result, and hundreds of thousands have been wounded,  crippled,  orphaned, made widows of and been made homeless and refugees. Hundreds of Ukrainian civilians and Ukrainian Prisoners of War have been tortured,  raped and executed by Russian soldiers and FSB agents.
You cannot possibly be serious about travelling to Ukraine as a Russian tourist.  If you are, then you are probably the stupidest man alive. In fact I am astounded that you have managed to qualify to study at University doing such a complex subject as engineering but maybe you are one of these people who are book smart but lack any common sense at all.

Oksana Zabuzhko is a Ukrainian writer, public intellectual, and feminist literary scholar whose works have been translated into over 20 languages. In 2023, she was named one of the BBC’s 100 Most Influential Women in the World, and in 2024, she joined the jury of the Berlin International Film Festival.  
  
In this post, we share Oksana Zabuzhko’s key arguments on why Russian and Ukrainian cultures cannot engage in dialogue until the war ends, what sets Russian imperialism apart, and why democratising Russia is impossible without its defeat in the war.

When the invasion began, he returned to Ukraine to become a military anesthesiologist. He says that his decision to join the Defense Forces was influenced by his Ukrainian-language education, family history, and a desire for change in the country.  
  
In this video, Dmytro explains why he, like millions of Ukrainians whom Russian propaganda uses to justify the war, has decisively risen against Russian aggression.

From what I can gather the consensus is for Trump to do a deal, any deal with Russia! and if it works for Ukraine great if not who cares,

Then use the increase in trade with Russia to supply USA with its raw materials needs previously supplied from Canada, this along with the Tariffs and other economic damage levied against Canada should force them to become the 51th state

Trump does not want Russia to collapse. But he may do that anyway if oil prices drop. Anyway...

Russia can't replace what Canada has. It's not logistically possible. They lack the quality of bauxite, they don't have the quantity, and worst of all, there's no way to process it/get it to the USA anyway.

4. Expect that Europeans will handle Ukraine reconstruction themselves, while Ukraine channels its future natural resources revenues to the US to pay off its ""debts"", and while the US basically can veto any future European  investment decisions into Ukraine.
5. The US companies will get to replace European companies in Russia, and do business as usual with them, while pressing Europe to remove sanctions on Russia.

Like an insane amount. Not even anatomically possible. 

If you care to understand modern Russia you need to pay specific attention to the work done by Vladislav Surkov, a one time advisor to Putin with immense power. Basically his idea for consolidating and solidifying Putin’s power was to turn all any and discourse in the country into a show and an illusion. Nothing was supposed to be certain and nothing was supposed to be what it seemed. Even Russian opposition was always in the throes of paranoia which one of them had closer ties to the FSB. It is indeed a very complex and interesting policy that actually deserves its own deep analysis. 

Anyway the point I am trying to make is that this cock goblin Dmitriev can say whatever the hell he wants. It is all smoke and mirrors as is the current Russian tradition. The point is whether the companies are American or European they all have to undergo a certain procedure that involves notifying the government officials and the said officials have been lamenting recently that no application has been put forward. NONE. No one is coming back. Because you would have to be really stupid to seek business in a country with rising taxes, all the indicators of a stagflation, crumbling infrastructure and a racketeering level corruption.",2025-04-04T13:49:41

But then I noticed the injured left thigh of the man on the stretcher (barely visible) and the second
clean stretcher in the foreground.

I hate to admit it, but this is probably the only moment during emergency admission that might yield such a picture: during transfer from ambulance stretcher to hospital bed.

Though there *should* be someone securing this dangling IV — stepped probably back to get out of the picture. Which would be at least a bit of staging, wouldn't it?",2025-03-31T04:57:59

While many judge war by frontline movements, its true purpose and ultimate goal — liberating those trapped under occupation — often remain behind the headlines.  
  
Since the start of Russia’s invasion in 2014, at least 2.5 million Ukrainians have experienced life under occupation. For those whose cities fell under Russian control in 2014, daily survival has been a harsh reality for 11 years.  
  
On the anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, we share the insights of Ukrainians who have experienced occupation — exploring what it means to be deprived of your rights in your own home and to wake up each day hoping for freedom.

This number is calculated based on military reports. Which means that if, for example an artillery battery fired one shot, and drone filmed 5 people, and a shell landing right on them - it already means 5 casualties. No one counts how much were actually dead, how much pretend to be dead, how much got wounded, and how much got severe wounds. Keep that in mind. 

Also, often times when soldiers get wounded - Ukrainian side registers russian casualties, but russians may possibly patch those soldiers up. And those same soldiers could potentially go back to the frontline and have another shot fired at them. And still make it back alive. But Ukrainians would obviously register that soldier as a casualty twice. 

So don't rely too much on this statistics. Only relative to the losses dynamics. So for example today this number increases by around 1200+ eliminated personnel per day. Two years ago this number was around 600+ per day. We don't know for sure how much were eliminated in reality, but we know that based on dynamics the losses count increased significantly.",2025-03-21T15:02:06

Taras Shevchenko: Ukraine's literary icon defying russian colonialism for centuries.,Ukrainer_UA,352,2025-03-10T04:03:48,Ukrainer_UA,12,"Today, [LNGG LAB](https://www.instagram.com/lngg_lab/?hl=en), in collaboration with Ukraïner, commemorates Shevchenko as a symbol of Ukraine's pride and inspiration of its resistance that continues to inspire the world:

Taras Shevchenko wasn’t just a poet — he was a revolutionary voice against Russian colonial rule. Born into serfdom, he used his words to fight oppression, exposing imperial injustice and advocating for Ukraine’s national liberation. His poetry was so dangerous to the Russian Empire that they not only imprisoned him but banned him from writing altogether. Yet, neither exile nor censorship could silence his legacy. His Kobzar became Ukraine’s most-read book, spreading underground and shaping the national identity.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Since the full-scale invasion began, supporting our team and gathering donations has become more challenging as we, like everyone else in Ukraine, focus on fundraising for our defenders. Now, we turn to you—the international community and supporters of Ukraine—to help us continue producing vital stories that not only support Ukraine’s fight against invasion but also remind the world of the value of freedom.

While I don't think there is no choice, without USA Ukraine can't do anything else than heroically defend while being slowly pushed out. 

While production some smaller systems like MANPADS or ATGMs etc is ongoing and can be delivered to Ukraine, Europe has no stockpiles of the weapons that will let Ukrainians stop offensive and counterattack with successful breakthroughs - Tanks, IFVs, Breaching vehicles, ARVs. Without those they will be on constant defensive.

Europe dropped the ball. There are only 2 NATO countries in Europe that make new tanks(hopefully soon K2 or Abrams will be produced in Poland): Turkey and Germany(with Greece, because hulls are made there). Italy has no manufacturing plant, UK built apartments in place where Challengers were built, France has no capability to build Leclercs. MGCS was a great chance to restart production, but Germany is sabotaging and delaying it, to not get a rival for Leopard. So France currently is without a capability to produce tanks and MGCS was delayed to 2040(and I already heard some voices about 2050). Not to mention that MGCS technical requirements are just absurd, much better protected tank with bigger canon but sub 50 ton. It's just not realistic. There is also upcoming KF51, but it doesn't exist in reality(it's turret technology demonstrator on hull of Leopard 2A4, to which Rheinmetall obviously doesn't have rights).

Personally I expected Europe to wake up and start with rearmament, but look at the orders for Leopards, everyone orders like 1 or 2(rare) battalions of tanks. It's a joke, same with the price of Leopard itself. Austrian gov approved procurement of 58 vehicles, with unit price of Leo 2A8 being 28 million euro. When you compare it to our(Poland) procurement it's unfunny joke. M1A2SEPv3 unit price is ~15.6m EUR and K2 unit price is ~18m EUR. Not to even talk about delivery time for Leopards vs K2s and M1s. I bet Leopard salesmen wear black nylon gloves and call it craft tank to justify the slow production and absurd price.

There is a reason why EU told USA that we can buy weapons for Ukraine from USA if they approve it, because there is nothing in EU stockpiles or production power to sustain Ukraine.",2025-03-02T01:57:21

Mr. President/White House staffers who actually read this,


I am shocked and appalled by the treatment of President Zelensky at the White House today. History will surely look back at this day in disgust at the antics of the President and Vice President. I am ashamed and embarrassed to call myself an American today; well, for about the past month, really. You want to frame yourselves as the so-called leaders of the free world, yet you willingly eat up regurgitated Russian propaganda straight from the mouth of the authoritarian dictator Putin, and then try to spew it to your fellow Americans and the rest of the world.


You side with a fascist invader, the leader of an army of murderers, torturers, kidnappers, and rapists, over a sovereign democracy. One that we signed a pact with, one that we were supposed to back and support in the event that Russia broke the same pact and invaded Ukraine. It's obvious that you wanted to try to look strong and tough and bully Zelensky into groveling and signing away the rights to Ukraine's natural resources to the tune of $500+ billion in exchange for no security guarantees. Instead you looked like children throwing a temper tantrum, the epitome of weakness. Everyone with a higher than room temperature IQ can see through the facade, and that this was the game you intended to play from the start. Sadly your sycophants don't care because they want to get their grubby hands on a piece of the magat pie.


I pray that the rest of the free world rallies behind Ukraine and shuns the weak, spineless cowards currently occupying the White House; leaders who refuse to stand up to oppression and tyranny and instead side with dictators, warmongers, and other scum. You're quickly destroying the reputation of The United States and eroding the trust that our long-term allies have previously had in us. Bravo.


I sincerely hope that Mr. Trump has some sort of epiphany or receives some form of guidance and realizes that true strength and leadership means standing up to Putin and his ilk, because that is what America is, that's what we are supposed to represent. We stand up to fascists, dictators, and tyrants. We punish mass-murderers, not ally ourselves with them for the sake of money and power. And no matter how hard you may think it, you cannot control people like that, and they are not your friends. Putin is not your friend. Russia is not our friend. They have shown time and time again that they have no regard for anyone other than themselves, and they can't be trusted.


Godspeed to us all in these troubling times.


P.S. Funny quote at the top there about not forgetting the constitution, seeing as how Mr. Trump has repeatedly violated it just in a month. You can be better than that. You can represent the ideals of freedom, opportunity, democracy, strength in the face of adversity, unity amongst all peoples that live within these great United States. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she with silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Mr. President and Members of Congress,

I am writing to express the deep shame and anger I feel as an American in light of the recent actions taken by our president and vice president. The ambush of a foreign leader, an act of such profound disrespect and betrayal, is a clear violation of the values that our nation was supposedly built on. I can no longer stand idly by as I watch this administration tarnish our reputation and undermine the very principles that we are supposed to uphold.

As a nation, we are blessed with vast resources and wealth, and with that power comes the undeniable responsibility to help those who are struggling, both domestically and abroad. It is appalling to witness a government that so willingly ignores the needs of its own citizens and the suffering of others while prioritizing personal or political gain. The current state of affairs is unacceptable, and I can no longer condone the actions of those in power.

The GOP, a party that has long viewed Russia as an enemy, must find the courage to stand up to this administration and speak out against the destructive course we are being led down. It is time for them to grow a spine, show some integrity, and defend the principles of freedom, democracy, and international respect that we claim to represent.

This is a critical moment in history, and I sincerely hope that the American people, along with our elected officials, will find the strength to do what is right and restore the honor that has been tarnished by those currently in office.

Sincerely,

Xxxx",2025-03-01T00:00:47

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the recent actions of Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance towards President Zelenskyy during his visit. It is disheartening to witness attempts to belittle an honorable man who is courageously defending his country against Russian invasion.

President Zelenskyy has shown remarkable resilience and leadership in these challenging times. It is imperative that we support Ukraine by providing the necessary weapons and resources to fight back, rather than exploiting the country for raw materials and treating its leader with disrespect.

Furthermore, Ukraine needs permanent security guarantees to end the war and ensure lasting peace and stability in the region. It is our duty to stand by those who strive for peace and justice in the face of adversity.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,",2025-03-01T00:15:32

“From a friend, feel free to share. 

On March 15th, many people will mail Donald Trump a postcard that publicly expresses our opposition to him. And we, in vast numbers, from all corners of the world, will overwhelm the man with his unpopularity and failure. We will show the media and the politicians what standing with him — and against us — means. And most importantly, we will bury the White House post office in pink slips, all informing Donnie that he’s fired.
Each of us — every protester from every march, each congress calling citizen, every boycotter, volunteer, donor, and petition signer — if each of us writes even a single postcard and we put them all in the mail on the same day, March 15th, well: you do the math.
No alternative fact or Russian translation will explain away our record-breaking, officially-verifiable, warehouse-filling flood of fury. Hank Aaron currently holds the record for fan mail, having received 900,000 pieces in a year. We’re setting a new record: over a million pieces in a day, with not a single nice thing to say.
So sharpen your wit, unsheathe your writing implements, and see if your sincerest ill-wishes can pierce Donald’s famously thin skin.
Prepare for March 15th, 2025, a day hereafter to be known as #TheIdesOfTrump
Write one postcard. Write a dozen! Take a picture and post it on social media tagged with #TheIdesOfTrump ! Spread the word! Everyone on Earth should let Donnie know how he’s doing. They can’t build a wall high enough to stop the mail.
Then, on March 15th, mail your messages to:
President (for now) Donald J. Trump
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500

Trump isn't making America great again... he's slowly showing the whole world that you can't be trusted anymore.

The common people dont care about billions and trillions... as long as we can provide for our families and live a good life with security, the rest is only what comes with life. When Russia invaded, the whole world condemned Russia's invasion... 3 years later... even if we all know the west has the means to cripple Russia or AT THE VERY LEAST , hurt them very bad... Zelensky a d his people are still looking for basic security guarantees... isn't this shameful?

Zelensky said ""no"" today ... to the toddler acting as president... so a tantrum began.

Why the tariffs? Well... maybe because we didn't give him a cookie or a new toy when he asked in the past, I don't know... toddlers do that sometimes... they really want the a specific toy but another toddler has it... so he takes it by force. Maybe that's what we're seeing here 😂

They threaten our national security by working with authoritarian regimes like Russia. I have the utmost respect for President Zelenskyy and I will support Ukraine however I can. On the contrary, I hold zero respect for Trump and Vance. Trump is a twice impeached felon who clearly demonstrates signs of dementia. Vance is a know it all blowhard and a jackass with a god-complex. Elon Musk is a ketamine-addicted narcissist and a fraud, not a genius. As a country, we are fucked with them at the helm.

This is my attempt to pursued the White House into doing the right thing. To give people an example or an idea to include the wild idea at the end. I also donate to U24 on a consistent basis but I feel I need to do more in my limited capacity.  I’d very much want the U.S. to fully support Ukraine and no more slow walking.

“Greetings Mr. President, I am writing to you with the concerns that transpired at the Oval Office today. I served in Ukraine teaching the Ukrainians English and enhancing their capabilities to meet NATO standards back in 2020-2021 during the end of your first term. I would very much like to reaffirm our commitments with Ukraine as they are a Christian and Democratic nation. We must support democracy. In addition, Ukrainians have vast military knowledge that will be vital in learning and adapting our tactical and strategic operations for future combat as drone swarms will be a path for the future. It is important to collaborate with the Ukrainians as they will improve our military and economic endeavors. Ukraine is sitting on lots of oil and natural gas that can be used for American companies to invest and help supply Europe and take away competition from Russia and/or gain leverage. I’d also recommend that VP JD Vance go to Ukraine unannounced if he feels Russia is not a threat. There would be no reason for VP Vance to be concerned for his life if he is in a residential area.  This is my recommendation for both of you to understand the dangers and threats that Ukrainians face daily. I appreciate your time and God Bless.”",2025-03-01T03:59:35

&gt;Dear Sir or Madam,

&gt;I recently watched President Trump's press meeting with President Zelenskyy and am deeply concerned about the image our president is projecting to the world.

&gt;Regardless of the decisions and agreements made, President Trump did not conduct himself in a manner befitting a president. His behavior was disrespectful toward another world leader, seemingly attempting to publicly embarrass him. Additionally, Vice President Vance’s conduct was also not an appropriate example of diplomatic leadership.

&gt;As an American, I am embarrassed by President Trump's remarks and actions toward President Zelenskyy. I strongly urge both President Trump and Vice President Vance to issue a formal apology and to conduct themselves with the dignity and respect expected of representatives of the United States of America.

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;\[Your Name\]

The actions and attitudes the President and the Vice President displayed in the oval office yesterday towards the president of Ukraine were shameful as an American to watch. I did not see a leader of the free world. I did not see a president who puts America first. I saw a vice president act like a bully to a guest of another nation, and a frightened American president stammer and shout about his own self image. There was no deal making. There was no self control by the president and vice president. I did not see a strong America.

I am also uncomfortable with the coziness the president has with Vladimir Putin of Russia, and I hope you share this unease. Comments such as, ""we go way back"" referring to his relationship with Putin should concern every American. A leader of the free world associating and normalizing in any way actions of a dictator like Putin, who has encumbered and persecuted his own people and terrorized independent and sovereign ex-Soviet nations, should be rightfully concerning to Americans if their own president permits or shares those same aspirations. The cruel and chaotic way the president has allowed Elon Musk to dismantle government and harass Federal workers affirms those concerns.

I will give limited optimism that this is the President's negotiating style and 'give him room to work'. But he better start showing results soon. Right now I see a president who is way in over his head after making big bold statements about his abilities and is freaking out about being nakedly impotent for a complicated issue that is millions of lives and several nations bigger than him.

Please reassure me, as your constituent, that America is not faltering on our principles to defend freedom. If we must retreat and admit we no longer can sustain that fight, which I do not believe we are there yet, let us do it with dignity, not that shameful display in the Oval office yesterday.

Zelensky should have signed the deal.  It would have meant American interests in Ukraine beyond just the humanitarian.  Those interests would have been protected.  Trump can't publicly talk about what that means, that would torpedo negotiations for the cease fire and beyond.  Everyone wanting Trump to come out and denounce or otherwise oppose Putin are being ignorant.  

You start with a cease fire, from there you can expand and negotiate towards your overall goals.  The cease fire wasn't going to be the final solution, it was a first step to help Ukraine to stop losing people.  Your people are an unreplaceable resource.

I get the history of Putin and breaking deals.  No one is arguing that.  But, Zelensky was actively sabotaging any chance of negotiations by trying to force Trump to publicly acknowledge all of that.

Marco Rubio summed it up quite nicely.  Aside from talking about needing an apology, which is just dumb.

I'll remind everyone that the entire world has sat back and for the most part left Ukraine to fight alone.  Yes, some equipment and logistics have been provided, but what else?  It's great all the happy meetings are taking place, but I'm doubtful much will amount from it.  Europe has always had a much bigger stake in what happens in Ukraine.  Yet, they don't seem overly inclined to go beyond material support.

The cold truth is the USA has no obligation to Ukraine, but we've been sending help.  Everyone mocks the USA for overstepping and being ""The World Police"" until they actually need it.

I get everyone is frustrated.  I'm also frustrated.  I was hoping the deal would just be signed and we could get working on diplomatically restoring Ukraine.  All of it.  Putin can be dealt with after.",2025-03-02T07:23:24

Now try to keep up:

The US has spent an avg of $22B/year on military aid to Ukraine during these 3 years. Compare that to the US defense budget of $820B/year. That's 2.7% of our annual military spend. 

In return, the Russian military (America’s second greatest adversary) is being devastated at relatively little cost and without risking the life of a single U.S. servicemember. The Russian military has lost a huge % of its military hardware, and, suffered huge troop casualties, far more than it did in the nine-year Soviet-Afghanistan war. The Putin regime has spent a massive % of its annual military budget on the war, greatly reducing its threat to other countries. Like, you know, the US. 

So even if you don't care about our allies' men, women and children being blown to bits - you're obviously devoid of that basic level of humanity - maybe someone you know, a child or maybe your dog, can try to help you understand this information, i.e. the fantastic ROI the US enjoys in inexpensively helping Ukraine decimate Russia's military. Not likely, given your dingus status and commitment to bending over for Trump and regurgitating his imbecilic talking points.

Like what do they really want? Trump/Putin/Bannon they've got what? 10 more good years (absolute best case) on their mortal frames?

Couldn't the Musks of all this idiocy just go back to their Yachts and do their Blow k-holes, fuck their Hookers, drink their martinis and just leave the rest of us alone?

No? Not Happy? Just want a little bit more eh...not satisfied.

Got to wake us up now???

Got to get Kash Patel in there- Thug moron who thinks he's the next Hoover.

I agree with these guys in one and only one capacity- We are going to go to war over freedom. From within the United States of America.

To Ukraine; we will need your help now over here too.

Europe at this point needs to immediately deploy troops to Ukraine and straight up seize upon Trumps hiccup.

STOP TAKING TRUMP SERIOUSLY!

STOP TAKING WORD SALAD CALIGULA SERIOUSLY!

It is one of the last moments that Europe can assert its authority here. I'm an American and our leadership is a faltering farce and a disgrace. Time for Europe to just immediately act with force and complete conviction on what Russia's end game really is here.",2025-02-22T11:52:53

1ive1g8,On why supporting Ukraine is important,plumboy82,58,2025-02-22T08:15:06,UnauthorizedUser505,1,"I feel bad for Ukraine and it is obvious that Russia is the agressor, My question is, why does most of the world say the US needs to protect and send more money to Ukrain? The Budapest Memorandum is often brought up, but if you read it, the US has not broken any promises. Russia broke their part of the agreement to Ukrain. Russia broke #1,2,3 and 4 of the agreement, but is that not between Russia and Ukrain? It is often said that the US said they will step in and protect them if they are attacked but that was not the agreement. The US said they will step in and provide assistance in the event of a nucular attack which has not happened. If I am missing something please point it out but I have been researching quite a bit and not seeing where the US agreed to outright protect from ANY invasion. 

  
Like I said, I am not siding with Russia. I just don't understand why everyone is talking like the US is responsible for protecting Ukrain. The agreement was for them to get rid of nukes and if they get attacked by nukes in the future than the US would help.  

  
Not trying to argue, just trying to understand responsibilities based off of the agreement",2025-02-28T22:46:24
1ive1g8,On why supporting Ukraine is important,plumboy82,58,2025-02-22T08:15:06,plumboy82,1,"It's important to remember that every soldier, including those from Russia, was once a child. They had dreams, hopes, and a future that was shaped by their upbringing, just like children everywhere. However, the reality of war robs them of their innocence and forces them into situations no child should ever face.

It's also worth noting that NATO, for all its claims of protection and peace, often ignores the welfare of children caught in the crossfire of conflicts. The focus on military strategies and geopolitical goals tends to overshadow the lives of the innocent, especially children, who suffer the most in these situations. We must ask ourselves whether the true protection of children is truly a priority in these larger political battles.",2025-03-01T07:08:10

Of course I don't think any innocent child should be harmed no matter what side they are on. I'm not saying we should or should not help

My question is why are so many people saying the US is breaking am agreement they made to protect Ukrain? There was never a blanket protection agreement made unless I'm missing something. Like I said in my last comment, the agreement was to send help if they were attacked by a nuclear weapon which has not happened. 

I've seen so many people say that by not sending more money/help that trust is being broken but I don't understand why the US is EXPECTED to send help just because they were invaded and if they are ever invaded again in the future. Is there an agreement that I don't know of saying that in the event of ANY invasion, the US will step in and assist?  The only one I know of says assistance will be sent in the event of a nuclear attack.",2025-03-01T19:48:10

That these reporters have secured themselves a spot as ""the"" news for a lot of people is a massive problem that is going to take a while to untangle.

Trump fell for Russian propaganda memes and thinks this is about NATO or whatever, when it was never about NATO...

I think this gives Trump far too little credit. He visited Moscow in 1987 and was buttered up by the KGB over Trump tower Moscow prospects. When he returned to the US, [Trump took out a full page ad in the newspapers that questioned US membership in NATO and asked why those nations couldn't pay to defend themselves.](https://apnews.com/article/05133dbe63ace98766527ec7d16ede08) To be clear, this was 38 years ago, longer than I've been alive. And Trump's positions on these items essentially haven't changed since. 

And now, face to face with Putin, Trump always defers to him and adopts the Russian position. I guarantee you that Trump not only understands what Putin is doing (see Trump's similar language vis a vis Canada and Greenland), but firmly believes that if he helps Putin, Putin will reward him with property in Moscow.

Trump is compromised, at best a useful idiot and at worst a knowing agent of Putin and the Russian federation, neither of which he has seriously criticised. Trump *wants* Ukraine to lose and *wants* to sabotage NATO as a quid pro quo for Russian favour and property deals, the better to personally enrich himself.",2025-02-14T23:39:43

The Siege of Leningrad was broken 6 months before Normandy.

Edit: While your original point of opening a second front to relieve pressure is completely valid, the claim that Normandy had any impact in Leningrad has no basis in history. The full lifting of the siege was in January 1944. The lifting of the full blockade was a full year prior to that, in January 1943. Operation Iskra (spark) established a corridor into Leningrad, and prevented the link-up of German and Finnish forces, and strategically eliminated the possibility of any capture of the city. This was happening AFTER Operation Uranus in the south that resulted in the encirclement of the Axis forces by Stalingrad, so if any forces were pulled, it was South, not West. There's absolutely no historical basis for the claim that Normandy, or Sicily for that matter, had any impact on the Siege of Leningrad. At all.",2025-02-10T14:22:31

&gt;Back in 1943, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was handpicked by Hitler to lead the German army’s defense of the Normandy region. He began by fortifying the Atlantic Wall in Normandy with more machine gun bunkers, millions of beachfront landmines, and by flooding inland marshes to trap Allied paratroopers. Rommel’s strategic preparations would ultimately help the Nazis inflict terrible Allied casualties on D-Day.

The main issue was Sumy.  For awhile there was a lack of defense lines and fortifications in the Sumy region.  The defense lines in the Sumy region were significantly upgraded only in 2024.  A large Russian force was slowly building up in the Kursk region and if nothing was done was likely to launch an attack before the upgrade was completed. The incursion bought time and in addition turned Russian defense lines into Ukrainian defense lines.  In addition to that, the town of Sudzha now acts as an important bulwark.  Overall it was a brilliant strategy.

1ilg3ik,Danylo’s father fought russians since their invasion at 2014. Now he is a War Veteran at 19 years old. Danylo’s view on the enemy is clear cut “it is us or them”,Lysychka-,3586,2025-02-09T14:39:36,Lysychka-,110,"Nineteen-year-old Danylo Todorov was born and raised in Ivano-Frankivsk in a military family—his father is an ATO veteran, and his mother worked at one of the region’s military units. When the full-scale war began, Danylo was 16 years old and studying in the 11th grade. Upon completing his studies in early summer 2024, he signed a five-year contract with the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade.

Danylo admits that his parents found it difficult to accept the news of him becoming a soldier. 

""When I was studying at the military college, they were fine with it. But when I actually joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they started worrying a lot. Still, they supported me then and continue to support me now,"" says the soldier.

**Overcoming Hazing Fears and Learning to Fly Drones**

Initially, Danylo was assigned to engine repair and maintenance. However, seeing his potential, his commanders transferred him to drone operations training.

""When I first joined my platoon, where older and more experienced fighters served, I was afraid there might be hazing. But there was none of that. On the contrary, the experienced guys gave me tips, helped me, supported me, never humiliated or pressured me. In our unit, we live by an unwritten musketeer rule: ‘One for all, and all for one.’ The brotherhood keeps us motivated to improve our skills so we can take down more enemies together.""

Initially, he carried out reconnaissance flights, and soon after, combat missions. Within six months, Danylo progressed from a beginner to an expert drone pilot, largely thanks to the supportive and motivated atmosphere of his unit.

His drone, operating at night, is equipped with a thermal camera to detect enemy movement, even when they try to stay hidden. However, not everything that ""glows"" on the thermal camera is an enemy—sometimes, it’s an animal. That’s why a drone operator needs sharp eyesight, attentiveness, and keen observational skills.

""It’s important to have quick thinking—the ability to make the right decisions fast in difficult situations. And you have to be stress-resistant. For me, music and something sweet help me unwind,"" Danylo adds with a smile.

**He notes that fear and anxiety are a normal part of war.**

""Fear is common in war. But you have to control it. The hardest thing for me was getting used to the constant shelling by enemy artillery. But over time, I adapted. The key is never to lose vigilance.""

On January 14, 2025, Russian forces launched five massive assaults on the positions of the 10th Brigade. Danylo was among those who helped repel the attacks.

""We did everything we could. But honestly, our infantry did an outstanding job. 

Over 50 Russian soldiers were neutralized, more than ten were wounded, and one was captured. Additionally, the enemy suffered significant material losses, including two BMPs, 39 motorcycles, two ATVs, and 16 FPV drones.

**Danylo’s view of the enemy is clear-cut:**

""These are people who want to take my land, my home, and my freedom. They bring death to my fellow Ukrainians and destruction to my country. If I don’t take him out, he’ll take me out,"" he says.

I grew up with Ukrainian Canadians and if I were physically able to manage it I would be in Ukraine right now, helping in any way I could. I'd cut the cabbage and sweep the floors for those brave soldiers if I knew I wouldn't be in the way.

Luckily we now live in a time, although clearly not perfect, where there is more understanding and help for returning soldiers. Mental health is not a subject that should be hidden, we are all human, each with strengths and weaknesses; some physical, some mental, some spiritual, we can use those differences to divide us or we can create a symbiosis.

I hope I'm pragmatic but I also know there is an optimist inside me; I feel that sometimes people need to be shown a glimmer of light so they can find their way out of the tunnel of darkness that threatens to envelope us all at this time. I can't be in Ukraine but I can still be supportive.

Did you see the video of the Ukrainian team entering the stadium at the Invictus games? I'm a sixty year old farmer from Saskatchewan and I was tearing up, hard.

The outgoing coalition contains the German parties whose voters poll strongest in supplying Ukraine with weapons (even when counting the FDP that left).

Merz's Union has been instrumental in ripping open a multi-billion hole in Germany's federal budget (granted, their use of Corona-funds for climate issues \_was\_ outside its original scope), indirectly affecting Ukraine-aid and also indirectly causing the government coalition to fall as they argued (among other things) about Ukraine-aid.

Ukrainian refugees are one of the [main targets](https://www.tagesschau.de/faktenfinder/merz-sozialtourismus-101.html) of Merz's anti-immigration rhetoric.

Whatever critic one can give Scholz regarding his Ukraine-policy, there is not a single issue where Merz, of all people, promises to act better in Ukraine's interest. Especially Ukrainian refugees in Germany should be concerned. Merz \_might\_ eventually increase support for Ukraine still to set himself apart from Scholz - or he might reduce it for the same reason, entirely depending on which strata he seeks to pander to. With the recent vote the latter seems a bit more likely.

Currently the only ones who i trust to be more supportive of Ukraine than Scholz and his SPD are the Greens, and they are not exactly guaranteed to be part of the next coalition. Actually their outspoken support of Ukraine might become just another motivation for Merz to distance himself from supporting Ukraine (the Greens are one of the long term rhetorical targets of the Union, in some aspects outright parroting Russian propaganda).",2025-01-29T23:10:55

I'm not much of an archaeologist, but I do find this kind of thing fascinating. Last summer I visited a similar mound on Jersey, one of the British Channel Islands.  It is called La Hogue Bie- Google it, its fascinating- the original purpose was a burial mound, then a small Christian chapel was built upon it, then the Germans incorporated it into part of their defense system during the occupation.  To cap it all, a vast hoard of gold and golden artifacts was found nearby. Well worth a visit- I think it is Neolithic so that is over 3000BC ,is over 12 metres high and was a ritual site and passage grave, which you can still crawl into. Fascinating. 
Thanks for sharing the articles. 
It is so important to remember that Ukraine is not just about the current war- it has existed for many centuries and has a rich culture and history!
I for one will be visiting after the war to see the stunning countryside,  forests, castles, rivers and architecture.",2025-01-18T13:21:05

That's an unfortunate extrapolation of the fact that Finnish and Hungarian are distantly related linguistically.

Finnish and Estonian *are* quite similar linguistically though - roughly on par with Portuguese and Spanish or Dutch and German.

Finnish and Hungarian differ from each other in a similar degree as say English and Bulgarian. Each pair belongs to the same language family (Uralic for the former, Indo-European for the latter) but each pair is mutually unintelligible.

ETA: Coincidence or not, Hungarian's closest linguistic relative is an endangered language, Mansi, spoken in the swamps and floodplains of western Siberia (i.e. the location for a big part of Russia's fossil fuel deposits). 

At the same time, it's precisely *because of* the Russians (see Russification) that Mansi is endangered. There are currently fewer than 1,000 speakers left and Mansi is at risk of going extinct by the 2050s barring a miraculous turnaround in the Russians' attitudes to anything non-Russian.",2025-01-17T20:20:20

Poland would annex Hronda and Brest as administrative zones until integration.  Minsk would be a some vague colition of U.S., French, Finnish, and German troops.  Everything else, with its unpleasant neighbors would go to Ukraine, though Russian and Belasurian forces might hold east of the Dnipro River (though not the right name for the river in Belarus; stupid bot), making a new permanent border.

They had the idea of establishing an apartment building for people in the literary world, which they called the Slovo (Word) Building. 

However, the building did not save them: instead, it turned into a place of persecution, nicknamed ‘The Pre-Execution House’ by writer Ivan Bahrianyi. The majority of the Slovo Building’s residents were part of the ‘Executed Renaissance’ generation, who became the victims of repression in the 1930s.

That said, Putin's power now depends heavily on the war continuing - his people will seek prosperity after the fighting ends, and Russia's economy just isn't built for that. For all their complaining, Russians are actually tolerating their current suffering precisely because of Putin's false narrative of existential self defense. So, even though an active defeat of Russia is the best possible outcome, failing that, what some might call appeasement will actually represent disenfranchisement of the leading force in this evil. We will be spotlighting his failures as a leader by removing the distraction the war represents. Russia is very good at defeating itself, let's remember (watch this for some hope: https://youtu.be/R0H9bRPeUck?si=gdaEHcJTa5--L0Oi) 

But yeah - I for one am not done with making an example of Russian aggression. This shit belongs in a different century and we need to underscore that with our collective response. Russia in the years to come, along with any other power that gets ideas about unprovoked aggression, needs to remember what happens here today in Ukraine and think ""screw that - there must be another way"".",2025-01-07T09:25:59

I do myself, because I believe that ending the war and supporting soldiers will stop civiian suffering the fastest. 


But it will not remove the type of suffering that's there already. Most here just celebrated Christmas, or Hannukah. We've all seen happy faces of people recieving a present. These children didn't have that. But we can make it happen. 


I've donated 2 years ago, and again this year, to Jester for his St Nicholas drive. Join in on it, and make sure these 52 children also get their (delayed) presents. ",2025-01-06T11:17:45

At the end of the day these are children who deserve to have a childhood but have been robbed of it and the most important people in their life.

God forbid any other family in the world go through anything like this. I would not wish on any world leader to experience the feelings I have experienced when presenting posthumous awards and seeing the eyes of mothers, wives and children of soldiers who have given their lives for Ukraine and hearing from them: ""Please don’t let it be in vain."" Thousands of our men and women have been killed. They are always here, with us, they look down on us from the heavens. And we have no right to let them down, to betray their heroic deeds and their memory.

The plan was obviously to seize Kyiv, install their puppet regime while the Ukrainian government, civil service, military, police would be purged.


The Russians would start with the people at the top, then they'd work their way down and grab anyone they deemed might be a threat.
They'd get people at night, take them to a remote location, murder them and dispose of their remains in their crematoriums, so they'd be plausible deniability (just like how they lied about all their other crimes like MH17).


They've done this shit before - the Katyn massacre anyone?

&gt; “The execution lists were to include Ukrainian language, literature, and history teachers; ATO veterans; journalists; scientists; writers; clergy of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and other denominations supporting Ukraine; public and political figures; and heads of government and local authorities,” Budanov said.

This is not a surprise to me. In Slovakia, the extreme pro-Russian groups have also compiled ""kill lists"" of local people and circulated them online a few years ago, although in their case it is obviously just a pipe dream.

Europe was found with their hands in Cookie Monster's cookie jar with no way to fight back.  They took on Russian gas, gutted military spending, put the security of national sovereignty on a foreign ally, and believed themselves safe and isolated from the terrors of the world.  The lesson should always be ""never trust in absolute peace"", at some point there will always be a madman who believes what is yours is theirs.

Ukraine is paying the price for Europe's mistake and let's hope that it doesn't repeat the mistake of backing down from a bully because if a bully isn't stopped, they will continue to find things that they will try to take.  Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania know this, whether or not the rest of Europe can rise to the challenge will decide the outcome.

On the other hand, it is so amazing how they managed to stand their ground, fight back, and fight off the invaders day after day, week after week.

When this began 1000 days ago, i didn't think it would last that long, in fact i didn't even think putin would be so crazy to actually attack at first - and yet here we are. I just hope you guys get all the support you can get. Hopefully the NATO countries can step up their efforts and also allow free use of all weapons against all targets and locations from and in ruzzia. putin must be stopped, this can't go on.

Equipment promised by the Western countries, especially equipment against glide bombs that Russian bombers are using every day in hundreds.   
The answer to your question is for Western countries like the US to provide promised Patriots, Bradleys, Abrams tanks, and most importantly F-16s armed with long-range missiles to strike deep into the Russian rear.   
Including tomahawks to strike the factories and airbases producing and repairing a lot of damaged vehicles.   
  
Imagine if Olenya which houses the Tu-95s was struck with 20 cluster munition warhead ATACMS. All those strategic aircraft would be lost. Or if Tomahawks destroyed the Tu-22M3 fleet? The Shahed factory in Alabuga, Tatarstan  
Since the very beginning, the USA was afraid to win against Russia, out of fear that nukes would be in the wrong hands. Now Russia is handing out planes and nuclear tech to Iran and NK. not to mention that Russia has been the very definition of wrong hands, but US has chosen to be blind to that.",2024-11-19T17:35:57

One must ask what NATO is exactly useful for if it doesn't intervene in even a limited capacity.  Even as a reserve force in the West of the country.  It won't even commit to a defensive posture regarding aerospace defense for it's Eastern members.  It isn't a proactive alliance at this point, barely reactionary.

All other stuff that is needed to fight wars? 

It's only US because only US has military industry, stockpiles and capabilities that it can provide to Ukraine to win this war. Europe has none of it and they don't have. 

Now, every such a problem could be solved with enough money but again it's the same problem with US. It's just doing something for the sake of not doing nothing.
Europe could have been buying hundreds of thousands of artillery ammunition for Ukraine outside of EU but they didn't for more than 2 years. And it's not because they couldn't.

 Europe could have invested in Ukrainian military industry and in Ukrainian drones, but they didn't and it's not because they couldn't. US could have started training Ukrainian pilots in F-16 in June 2022 and train a lot of pilots and provide Ukraine with a strong air force to fight russia already in 2023 but they didn't. US could have started training Ukrainians to operate patriot batteries in the beginning of the invasion and not wait until December 2022 when russia destroyed Ukrainian energy infrastructure first time but they didn't and they waited.

US could have provided cluster munitions for Ukraine in June 2022 that would save thousands of Ukranian lives but they didn't. They waited until it was September 2023 when the counteroffensive had already failed. Could have US provide at least half of what russia spends on the war effort? Yes, absolutely and combine that if major European countries spent 0,5% of their GDP on military aid, that would stop russian genocidal invasion, bring peace in Europe, Ukraine in NATO. Not doing so is thousands of times more expensive and that doesn't even counts that Chinese invasion of Tywan will be even more likely to happen now that they see how western countries have reacted to russia. And that's russia, China is enormously more important to world economy and trade than russia so the response will be significantly less strong

If Europe and US implemented the same sanctions in 2014 and send 2022 military aid package to Ukraine in 2014, our country would have thrown russian army out of the Donbass, russian economy would have collapsed and none of it would have happened.

The Leopard 1's Ukraine received are technically in a better shape than some old Leopard 2 sent to Ukraine. They went through different phases of modernisation. Just like the Leopard 2 from 1978 is not the same as the Leopard 2 from today.

The difference is a lot of Leopard 1 can be given away this is not the case with the Leopard 2. There are not many tank battles happening in Ukraine anyway and given the muddy terrain you might even be better off with a tank that is 20 tonnes less.

It is more mobile than any other tank on the battlefield in Ukraine, it has a big gun with nightvision and a perfect stabilisation.

Basically a light MBT, a concept the US just recently adopted again with their M10 Booker as infantry support vehicle.

And then it also is a simple numbers game. For example replacing those 18 Leopard 2 tanks Germany sent to Ukraine cost Germany 525 million €. This is not sustainable especially since Germany has a debt brake written in its constitution. So the government needs to try an squeeze out the most bang for the buck. Nothing Scholz can do about it. The debt brake was confirmed by the highest court and it is actually the (FDP) and the opposition (CDU) who blocked a reform so we can spent more money. 

And really looking at how most vehicles get lost in Ukraine it doesn't matter much which tank you are in. Most of the time it is mine or drone damage rendering the tank useless and the disembarked crews later on being ended by drones.  

Drone countermeasure, air superiority and no senseless charges at enemy lines would be much more important than the discussion about the tank model given. This also shows looking at the list of Oryx.

16 M1A1, 2 Challenger 2 and 41 Leopard 2 lost. While on the other hand only 5 Leopard 1 so far were confirmed to be lost.
So really i don't know were you get your conclusion from that the Leopard 1 is so much worse for Ukraine. So far we are not seeing this in the numbers.",2024-11-02T00:26:45

Not defending Ukraine?

&gt;They are sending HUNDREDS of BILLIONS to Ukraine in military aid.

No, they don't. In three years they have committed only 60bln of military aid to Ukraine. And those are commitments, half of those commitments are USAI, that type of aid that takes many years for US to produce so in reality it's a lot less.

Russia for example just next year alone will spend 140bln on this war.

&gt;They have vowed to replace every single Bradley lost and just signed off on sending 2000 Humvees. 

Out of 14 brigades that Ukraine prepared and trained for counteroffensive, US and Europe armed only 3.

&gt;They are meant to be used in conjunction with air support

How much air support US has provided in those three years of war. I'm curious.

It is a promise not to attack,  not a treaty to defend in the case of an attack.

Because you wanted to make sure that Soviet nukes did not spread to other, less favoured nations.

Yes, because Ukraine doesn't have Intelligency agency, including Budanov that was drawing arrows on theaps for western news agency saying how russia will invade.

Of course Ukraine didn't know, that is why Ukraine asked western countries to implement sanctions against russia, already in January. That is why Ukraine rushed the Territorial defense act and started partial mobilization before the invasion started.

Did US delivered Humvees? Yes. Yet for some reason we still have to fund new vehicles for Ukrainian army on daily basis.

Ukraine is going to have to take the fight to Moscow locally if they want to keep their country.

We must keep in mind that France is one of the rare countries in Europe to have an air force, a navy (with a new aircraft carrier under construction), projection capabilities, submarines and a nuclear arsenal.

All of this contributes directly to the deterrence capacity, for France, Europe, NATO, etc.

And it has a cost.

The word ""courage"" should be  reserved to characterize the man or woman, who is leaving the infantile sanctuary of the mass mind. Sam Keen Fire in the Belly

Courage is not the absence of fear but rather the assessment that something else is more important than fear.” — Franklin D. Roosevelt


“Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.” — Winston Churchill 


“Courage is never to let your actions be influenced by your fears.” — Arthur Koestler

""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" ― Winston Churchill


""You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.'"" ― Eleanor Roosevelt

The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."" Eleanor Rossevelt

It is not the strength of the body that counts, but the strength of the spirit."" ― J.R.R. Tolkien

A man with outward courage dares to die; a man with inner courage dares to live."" ― Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching

""Have enough courage to trust love one more time and always one more time."" ― Maya Angelou

“Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen.” — Brené Brown

“It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.” — E.E. Cummings

“The secret to happiness is freedom…and the secret to freedom is courage.” – Thucydides

""Spontaneity with its incalculability is the greatest obstacle to total domination over man."" Hannah Arendt.

Now we must take courage from Ukraine's courage and finally do what our ancestors had promised, to arm liberty more than tyranny.

The man wanted ammunition and not a ride, we better finally assure to give him that and more.

Ukraine's victory is our victory, and their enemy is also our enemy. Russia threatens all free nations their corruption will spread unless we finally understand that we are in this together, Ukrainians are our brothers, fellow Europeans and we must finally help with all we got instead of giving them just enough to not die. That is not worthy of us, and it makes me feel ashamed, to be honest.

The entire Western approach to this conflict is a continuous accumulation of incompetence and misjudgments. Sometimes I wonder what is actually going on in the heads of our bureaucrats and what they do all day long.

Apart from the Poles and the Baltic states, and perhaps Finland, no one seems to be able to deal with the Russians properly.

The deployment of Russian troops took place long before the full scale invasion began, and yet nothing was done in time to counteract it. A separate maneuver by a few Western countries in Ukraine would probably have prevented this escalation.

It seemed to me from the beginning that the US and large parts of the West had no interest in Ukraine and were actually prepared to leave it to the Russians. Only when the Ukrainians put up fierce resistance were the bureaucrats forced to act.

As for the US having no interest in Ukraine, we’ve been ramping up the type of military aid provided to Ukraine prepare since 2014 after everybody in the west did practically nothing about Russia invading Crimea. Ukraine has always been a key US interest in the region. You think we just stopped caring about Russia after the Cold War ended? We’ve been providing aid to Ukraine since 1991, in fact 90% of foreign military aid prior to the invasion came from the US. Hopefully we take the gloves off after the election, unrestricted usage of weaponry, etc. I know it sucks ass right now but Ukraine became a political football, one of the worst things that can happen for any cause involving US politics, for the Republicans in the election, that calculus changes next week. Just hope for at least a democrat controlled house and Harris in the White House. Harris I think will be more aggressive in her approach instead of the cautious and measured approach from Biden in regard to Ukraine and Russia.

US intelligence was the only one saying it was coming for months, Europe and Ukraine as well didn’t believe them and those that did thought they were blowing it out of proportion of what was coming down the pipe.

That is not quite true. At first, in addition to the American intelligence services, others also warned of the invasion, such as the British. While others, such as the Germans, were completely mistaken.

Then it is also not true that the warnings were not taken seriously. Selenskyj has already said that he communicated in a certain way in order not to spread panic, while behind the scene the Ukrainian army has actually prepared for this invasion. He also asked the western leaders to implement sanctions immediately and not to wait for the start of the invasion. European leaders have also traveled to Moscow to somehow prevent the invasion.

&gt;As for the US having no interest in Ukraine, we’ve been ramping up the type of military aid provided to Ukraine prepare since 2014 after everybody in the west did practically nothing about Russia invading Crimea.

But the US didn't do that much. It may be that 90% of the military aid came from the US, but this aid was only marginal overall. It certainly helped a little, but it wasn't substantial. And it doesn't seem to have impressed Putin either, at least not as much as the nuclear warheads would have done that the Ukrainians had to give to the Russians under pressure from the US.

And it took several years after the war began in 2014 for Ukraine to receive a few lethal weapons systems from the United States.

However, despite all the help before 2022, everyone still assumed that Ukraine would only survive for a few days given Russia's superior power. And yet nothing significant was done to prevent the full scale invasion. On the contrary, the West was prepared to leave Ukraine to the Russians and possibly react with a few sanctions. 

And these complete misjudgments about the Russians and also the Ukrainians are the problem. 

Now someone who claims to be able to end the war in 24 hours could become President of the USA. Again, a completely naive, unrealistic assessment of the situation. One has to despair in the face of all this incompetence.",2024-11-01T05:05:10

Vietnams government still thinks in terms of the old Cold War split.  But the hearts of the people are very much with Ukraine in my experience. And they're also practically married to South Korea.

Cool little anecdote, Korea was united largely because a Vietnamese prince by the name of Ly Long Thường brought his kingdom there in exile cuz it was full of civil war and strife.

The Korean emperor of Silla had a dream of a pheonix flying in from the south and said there would be a great man coming and to give him everything he needs. 

Prince Ly went on to organize Silla's army for them so that they could conquer the other two kingdoms.  Then he went on to lead the war against the Mongols.

@President_KR
 of the Republic of Korea Yoon Suk Yeol. First and foremost, I thanked him for South Korea’s consistent support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as for the financial and humanitarian assistance already provided and pledged.

We discussed the involvement of North Korean military forces in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The conclusion is clear—this war is becoming internationalized, extending beyond two countries.

I shared recent data with him on the deployment of 3,000 North Korean troops to Russian training grounds near the combat zone, with their presence expected to increase to approximately 12,000.

We agreed to strengthen intelligence and expertise exchange, intensify contacts at all levels, especially the highest, in order to develop an action strategy and countermeasures to address this escalation, and to engage our mutual partners in cooperation. As part of this agreement, Ukraine and the Republic of Korea will soon exchange delegations to coordinate actions.

Finally, I invited South Korea to join the G7 Vilnius Declaration on bilateral security guarantees in support of Ukraine.

The odds of successfully knocking out North Korea's nuclear capabilities in the first couple hours of an actual war and preventing them from being used is quite high. Russia has 6000 nukes and a lot more advanced delivery systems.

This is a roundabout, diplomatic way for Zelensky to deliver some *very* bad news to North Korea.  And to Russia.

South Korea is highly focused of course on national defense against their psychotic neighbor.  Not as much on other international affairs.  But by involving North Korea in the Ukraine invasion, Kim has made Ukraine South Korea's business.  By draining North Korea's military assets in order to support Putin, Kim has eroded the detente that his country has enjoyed for so long.

The absolute best case for Kim and Putin here is that South Korea supports Ukraine directly and facilitates the surrender and defection of Korea's forces in the Ukrainian theater.  That's their best case.

Worst case is that South Korea reacts to North Korea becoming conventionally hollowed out while gaining the potential from Russia for a near-term nuclear escalation by drawing the obvious conclusion that now is the best time to settle their differences once and for all, while they still have a chance to.

I have no idea what the threat threshold is for South Korea at which point it becomes a better idea for them to strike across the border at North Korea missile sites than to preserve their existing detente.  But there is a threshold there somewhere.  And Kim has been induced to push it.

Personally I would not bet against Putin's folly in Ukraine ultimately leading to the end of the Korean War.

If nothing else, North Korea already had a formidable opponent in the Korean NIS.  Now they also have Budanov to reckon with....",2024-10-29T23:25:53

If those North Koreans have been sent to the front, by now they are mostly dead.  If they are used to replace Russians so the Russians can be sent to the front, those Russians are now mostly dead, and more Koreans are now needed to replace more Russians.

After a month, a winter, a year, that's not going to seem so small anymore.

Anyway that's just troops.  North Korea has also already dumped its once-feared stockpile of artillery munitions on Russia.  How's the restocking going?

These trends combined with an ostentatious increase in nuclear threat against the South are going to cause a major rethinking of the situation in Seoul.  I can't see how it would not.  I don't think the South are fools.",2024-10-30T18:41:18

His comments included a promise to return to Russia and Ukraine stating, “When all these problems are over, we will come to your homeland.” He further indicated plans to also visit Kyiv. 


Leto’s comments have elicited outrage from some Ukrainian observers, as he appeared to downplay the gravity of the war by referring to it as a “problem.” Previously, Leto had shown support for Ukraine, performing in Kyiv and commemorating the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. """,2024-10-13T09:23:07

The Cuban Missile Crisis was about short range Nuclear missiles as deterrence in Cuba vis-a-vi Turkiye in 1961, not long range missiles. Ballistic Missiles already existed. Ukraine gave up its Nuclear Missiles and Long Range Bombers for a broken promise never to be invaded.

The USA did not force Russia into invading Ukraine. This was never about NATO expansion into ""Russias sphere of influence"", it was about Russia trying to maintain its sphere of influence and internal power structure by making neighboring states dependent on or weak in comparison to Russia. Trying to maintain the KGB/FSB-Kremlin Power apparatus. Russia couldn't let Ukraine join the EU, a prosperous Ukraine could potentially lead to political discontent domestically in Russia. Putin forced Yanukovych to backtrack on the original association agreement in 2013 just weeks prior to the signing, his 2010 Election Campaign was literally for joining the EU, until Putin pressed in 2013. Ukrainians have literally been attempting to vote to join the EU ever since 1991 only to be stemmed by corruption deeply rooted to Russia throughout the decades. USA ""meddling"" in Ukraine pales in comparison to Russia's. Putin, and Putin himself made the war about NATO after the full scale ramp up of the war in 2022 (its been on for 10 years now....). Ukrainians were still largely for Military neutrality, even after the events starting in 2014 until Putin started the full scale assault in 2022. If this was truly about NATO, there would've been some sort of reaction from Russia when Sweden and Finland were added to the alliance after his puppet Orban couldn't delay any longer. Instead of a reaction, Putin just sent the forces and equipment along the border with Finland straight to Ukraine....

On top of all that, just to add: Oil Companies found the massive oil field in Donetsk/Kharkiv Oblasts only in 2011. Tying back to the prosperity viewpoint... Russia's GDP is completely reliant on exports of Oil and Natural Gas, Ukraine being a new player in the Oil/NG export market is not suitable for Putin.",2024-10-13T14:01:12

Prostitutes prostituting themselves, nothing new. Can't even boycott him, because, well... IDK what kind of budget money and time wise I'd need to consider going to 30 seconds to Mars concert.   

Guess that's a really poignant commentary by Leto, even if by accident. That's what Russians can look forward to. Return to level of normalcy where they have washed-up celeb circuit looking for audience. 

Also, being a prick that he is - he's not even letting you BUY a ticket, you ask for the privilege in a form, and they'll calculate how much they can wring you out for it, like Oasis has done xD

I left no longer a fan of 30, but became a big fan of Muse.

Ukraine has been an independent sovereign nation for more than 32 years but the Soviet-era versions of many geographic names stubbornly persist in international practice. The transliterations of the names of cities, regions and rivers from the Cyrillic alphabet into Latin are often mistakenly based on the Russian form of the name, not the Ukrainian; the most misspelled names are:

|||
|-|-|
|**Archaic Soviet-era spelling**|**Correct modern spelling**|
|the Ukraine|Ukraine|
|Kiev|Kyiv|
|Lvov|Lviv|
|Odessa|Odesa|
|Kharkov|Kharkiv|
|Nikolaev|Mykolaiv|
|Rovno|Rivne|
|Ternopol|Ternopil|
|Chernobyl|Chornobyl|

Under the Russian empire and later the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Russification was actively used as a tool to extinguish each constituent country’s national identity, culture and language. In light of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, including its illegal occupation of Crimea, we are once again experiencing Russification as a tactic that attempts to destabilize and delegitimize our country. You will appreciate, we hope, how the use of Soviet-era placenames – rooted in the Russian language – is especially painful and unacceptable to the people of Ukraine.

If you stay in Turkey, your home there can be a place for her family members to visit to get some relief and respite from the war.

1g2cu0o,We plan to move to Ukraine but I have concerns,proxypeer,235,2024-10-12T23:37:23,sol119,12,"1. Most likely no but since the war began there were some ramblings in the parliament whether to call women for military service. If I recall correctly it resulted in the government asking women to register/inform local authorities about their specialty (e.g. if they are medics or something). I don't know anyone who actually did that. My partner is Ukrainian and she travels to Ukraine once every couple of months, nobody made her go and register anywhere. 

2. No idea. I would recommend first just to interview with companies and just asking them if it's ok if you work remotely from Uzhhorod. 

3. Travel will be much less convenient compared to Turkey.

a) Civilian air traffic os closed for obvious reasons

b) Crossing the border is slow: spending ~8 hours at the checkpoint is not uncommon. Mainly because border guards check every bus/vehicle extra diligently/slow. At least from anecdotes from people I know who went to/from Ukraine through checkpoints in Moldova, Romania and Poland. But maybe it's better near Uzhhorod.

Last one. Relocation is a big decision. I would recommend for your wife to do come to parents for couple of months and see if she wants to move permanently, or maybe couple of months here, couple of months there is fine. I heard multiple stories about people moving abroad, getting homesick, moving back, realizing that being home actually kind of sucks and then moving back to the West.",2024-10-13T02:21:23

Women may serve only voluntarily. But all women with medical education must be registered for conscription. If it sounds stupid, that's because it is.

You might find a job as a software engineer, assuming good English level. But don't expect to get a job soon after arrival. A lot of companies silently left Ukraine, or at least stopped hiring. So software developers are in a much smaller demand these days than before 2022. If you specialize in mobile only, for example, don't even bother. Expect a dampened pay as well.

Language would be something to consider. Do you speak Ukrainian or Russian? If not, tough shit, because the majority of Ukrainian population can't string together two words in English.

It's probably worth noting that no Ukrainian company in my sector wanted me at the time, although I'd probably be ok now.

This is not in IT though although I'd bet that if OP speaks Ukrainian to a reasonable degree (which I'm led to believe was the actual problem although isn't now) it won't be more complicated than a Ukrainian finding work.

2. You need to find a job not in Ukraine but in Europe or US. Yes, you can find a job in Ukraine but it might be damn hard. Because now a lot of Ukrainian companies don't want to hire people in Ukraine because of the risks (even risk with lack of electricity). So there are a lot of people here who want jobs. 

Before that it was kind of cool because companies were hiring cheap employees in Ukraine and selling their work to the West for more money. Imagine we have 10 specialists and the majority of them worked for western companies. Yes you could find 1 Ukrainian business. But now the situation has changed and they all work inside Ukraine for Ukraine companies. So it will be hard to squeeze in.

If you decide to do it - I'd suggest find a remote job in Europe or US. Make more money, and live in cheap Ukraine like a god :) 

3. About moving. I dunno man. Like, I'm leaving here, and it's pretty much ok. But if there will be no light - it's tough. They warned us - it will be 12-16 hours without light in winter. You can't save food in fridge, you can't cook. In new buildings where everything on electricity - you can't have water or heat. You don't have internet, you don't have even mobile connection because they satellite towers will be turned off too. It's hard. 

Maybe russians will hit atomic power plants. Maybe they will hit some other plant and there will be a lack of heat. We don't know. 

And the situation will escalate more and more. They still haven't use a nuke, they promised that many times.

I'd actually suggest you wait a bit. Maybe till spring. Will see. The winter ends, maybe the situations with US election change something (and if Tramp wins - it will be 10 times harder for us). 

If your wife is worried about parents - maybe just let her travel there once a month, or whatever. But my opinion - it is not that smart to quit you job and move in country with the biggest war in 21th century, without electricity and a risk of escalation, you know?...",2024-10-13T08:09:01

Currently, I have no time off left (I took it all after we married) and the company is not in it's best state. They've laid off around 20 people including devs. So making that move is bit risky since they rely on the devs who left after a lay-off. I don't like the company that I am working for is also another reason I have not much hesitation to quit.

I know having no job and losing stability is something huge, but in the other hand time flies and first time in my life I am seriously considering to take a risk (a real one) for something good.

Uzhhorod is  as far west as you can go in Ukraine before hitting Slovakia, and north of it is Poland. The only way Russia would hit Uzhhorod would be by sending missiles through Polish/Slovakian airspace or over Romania via Transnistria. I doubt that would happen.  


It's one of if not the safest city in Ukraine. 

I doubt that they would be at much risk.

1g2cu0o,We plan to move to Ukraine but I have concerns,proxypeer,235,2024-10-12T23:37:23,Evakotius,1,"2. Many of us work as ""FOP"" group 3, which is something like ""independent entrepreneurs"". I am not sure if non-resident can register that. But if it is allowed - then no problem, having that you can work for both Ukrainian or non companies. That is very popular today. As of finding a job because we are at war - that depends on your level. Sure the war worsened things, but I, as senior dev, still receive job offerings even tho I am not in the search and less than 150km from frontline.

What I would if I were you - check if you are allowed for IP group 3 that's one. Second is just direct letter to any/all big outsourcing companies in Ukraine. [dou.ua](http://dou.ua) in help.

3. If you get an income you might think how you the money out of Ukraine if you need so. There are limitations on how much you can send out / how much non $$ or Euros you can buy per month and so. But not sure how it applies for non-resident.",2024-10-13T14:40:58

Someone from this sub also wrote me about “Fop” I think that option will be available for me after I’ve lived there for a year. Do u think not having that could be a major obstacle?

I have 4 years of backend and 2 years of full-stack experience and since every company rates differently from others I don't know where they put me but somewhere between the mid and senior, I assume.

Limitations about the money were something that I didn't know, I will make research about it.

I dunno if there is other way for you to get salary legally.  Or will any company would risk taking you, non-resident, in shadow. IP group 3 is just Ukrainian bless for IT honestly. You officially paying just 5% taxes (for now) and work for anyone across the glove.

- every company rates differently

And every market I would assume. I don't how Turkey IT related to Ukrainian. But I can tell you for sure Ukrainian IT doesn't suck but still is far away from German salaries.

The Turkish market is around 3k$ for my current level, but only global companies or e-commerce leaders of Turkey will pay that, maybe game studios too. The rest of the market pays 2k$.

We've had quite a bit of a pro-russian presence in the greater Verona area since way before the invasion during almost 20y of right-wing political tenure, and there's definitely some fifth column shit happening to this day.

Just to add a little extra context, the needle of the local political scene's compass has been pretty much constantly stuck on the right quadrant ever since 2002, and that became especially prevalent in the last mayoral run from 2017 to 2022, when we had an elected mayor whose political background is, and please act surprised when you read this, firmly rooted in [Italy's second most favorite postfascist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Alliance_(Italy)). During this timespan we had an [unofficial DNR diplomatic office/""embassy""](https://jamestown.org/program/italy-ukraine-relations-signs-of-improvement-but-no-breakthrough/) (as in not recognized by the Italian government but often involved in events/fora/PR stunts involving the local right-wing scene) pop up in 2019 in addition to the an official RF diplomatic office, opened in 2008 and defunct since shortly after the invasion.

Now that the ball's in the field of a center/left-leaning mayor, there's been less buzz about that aside from the odd [odd fifth column PR stunt](https://www.larena.it/territorio-veronese/citta/caso-manifesti-filorussi-1.12453166) backed by people stemming from Lega Nord (incidentally, a party who originally kicked off as a pro-secessionist, with strongly implied ties to the russosphere and the most reactionary, destabilizing parties within the EU) and [Italy's most favourite postfascist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Force_(Italy)). As for the more overt support of the invasion and the shit that has been happening ever since, it seems fair to point out that we had a worrying amount of ""[anti-NATO pro-peace rallies](https://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/verona/politica/22_maggio_10/verona-corteo-anti-nato-diventa-notizia-russia-42d5e202-d03f-11ec-a7c6-4db6d8e1e645.shtml)"" run and crowded by some of the same rabble-rousers that ran the COVID-negationist antivax rallies a couple years prior ([and more vocal PR stunts](https://www.larena.it/territorio-veronese/citta/lista-zelger-lettera-choc-a-putin-aiutaci-a-resistere-nella-lotta-per-la-democrazia-in-italia-1.9331371)). Oh, and a totally-in-good-faith [fundraiser ran by representatives of the aforementioned ""embassy"" right in front of the city hall""](https://www.larena.it/territorio-veronese/citta/europa-a-verona-il-banchetto-pro-bambini-russofoni-del-donbass-il-post-di-riccardo-magi-br-1.9363780).

Don't feel too ashamed about the idiocy of your fellow Italians, there's definitely some effort at play to target the most reactionary, close-minded and disinformed of us, especially in those contexts which are perfect breeding grounds for propaganda.

Look, as a Canadian this definitely concerns me but the OP is putting some spin on it as well.

The money didn't come from the government, it came from the Canada Media Fund which is an organization funded through both public and private sources (specifically Canadian media companies), and the purpose of it is to fund Canadian media projects so our entire media system isn't just swallowed up by the US system. That wasn't a dig at the US, it's just one of the downsides of being America's hat.

This propoganda film was partially funded by the CMF, through one if it's grants. That makes me angry, and there needs to be an audit done of how that happened.

However, it's important to remember that the CMF hands out more than $380m in funding a year (of which this piece of shit film only received $340k), and is kept at an arms length from the government. Canada has free and independent media, and government officials are not allowed to be a part of the CMFs funding decisions.

So saying that Canada ""funded and thereby endorses"" this gross film is, at best, a misrepresentation.

I'm betting the filmmaker misrepresented themself when applying for the CMF grant, and that was compounded by the board who looks over the grant proposals shitting the bed on their due dilligence. Worst case scenario, a board member or two deliberately greenlit a film they knew to be Russian propoganda and they should be fired. They should honestly be fired either way.

But again, no government official was involved in the process. Our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is a *trainwreck* of a politician. But one of the *few* (so very few) things he's done well is steadfast support for Ukraine from his government.",2024-09-08T19:59:51

""[Those credits are] put at the end of any credits that have received grant money. You'll see that exact BC Creates logo that is there as well in the credits of every Avengers film. If you recieve grant money you have to include those logos. It's not an endorsement.

Governments want credit for funding the arts, so any grant recipient has to include those in the credits, but governments don't have any control over the films. That's what I mean by 'arms length'.

To explain what I mean, these are the steps for funding:

1.) Politicians pass a bill to fund the arts. 

2.) This funding is then dispersed to one or more semi-independent bodies. Those bodies (like the Canada Media Fund) have a set of rules they have to abide by as set out in their mandate. For example, the CMF can only fund projects with significant Canadian content creation (such as taking place in Canada, or made by a Canadian filmmaker, etc). One of those requirements [to recieve this funding] is the logos in credits thing, because again, the government wants credit.

What's important to understand is that while the government sets the overall mandate for the organization, it **does not** have a say in specific projects or the day-to-day operations. This is the 'arms length' part, and how we try and promote the arts without creating just more propoganda outlets.

3.) Based on the mandate set for them, the organization (in this case the CMF) has a grant application period. Filmmakers can pitch ideas and apply for grants. Again, the government does not have a say on these individual applications.

It is an objective fact that public money helped fund this film.  The fact that Canadians don't support russian propaganda is precisely why it is important for them to know that this is being done with their money.

If funding organizations had been simply fooled by the filmmaker somehow, would they not have forced the fraudulent film to not use their logos and disavow it?  Would they not have fought the film's inclusion on the festival circuit?  Neither of those things happened, which makes it obvious that the people who helped fund and distribute the film are complicit and simply believe the propaganda.

You'll see that exact BC Creates logo that is there as well in the credits of every Avengere film. If you recieve grant money you have to include those logos. It's not an endorsement.

Governments want credit for funding the arts, so any grant recipient has to include those in the credits, but governments don't have any control over the films. That's what I mean by 'arms length'.

To explain what I mean, these are the steps for funding:

1.) Politicians pass a bill to fund the arts. 

2.) This funding is then dispersed to one or more semi-independent bodies. Those bodies (like the Canada Media Fund) have a set of rules they have to abide by as set out in their mandate. For example, the CMF can only fund projects with significant Canadian content creation (such as taking place in Canada, or made by a Canadian filmmaker, etc). One of those requirements is the logos in credits thing, because again, the government wants credit.

What's important to understand is that while the government sets the overall mandate for the organization, it **does not** have a say in specific projects or the day-to-day operations. This is the 'arms length' part, and how we try and promote the arts without creating just more propoganda outlets.

3.) Based on the mandate set for them, the organization (in this case the CMF) has a grant application period. Filmmakers can pitch ideas and apply for grants. Again, the government does not have a say on these individual applications.

4.) Approved grants are sent out and the organization then has little to no say over what is actually done with the money. They can sue the filmmaker if the money is mispent, or charge them with fraud, but they don't have actual control over the projects once they are funded.",2024-09-08T22:33:08

The government of Canada doesn't just hand out money for projects like this. It's handled by genuinely well run organizations. The Canadian Media Fund is significant to funding Canadian produced content. Shows like This Hour has 22 Minutes, Hudson and Rex, Murdoch Mysteries are part of their funding. It's all listed and audited on their website.

The person escaping scrutiny is the producer, Cornelia Principe, who knows what government grants to apply for to receive funding. Trofimova was used because she qualifies for cultural funding as a Canadian. Cornelia Principe is no slouch in this manner. Her last documentary film she produced was ""To Kill a Tiger,"" which was nominated for an Oscar (coincidentally, it lost the award to ""20 Days in Mariupol""). She has worked long enough in the film community in Toronto to know which programs to apply for funding. Her name attached to a project can influence the decision to approve funding.

Cornelia Principe used Trofimova's eligibility as a ""Canadian"" film maker to apply for funding from the Ted Roger's Fund, Canadian Media Fund, and other organizations that put the project in motion.",2024-09-08T18:57:47

Ukrainian politicians are pushing the Toronto International Film Festival to cancel the screening of a documentary about Russian soldiers fighting Ukraine. The film is propaganda that glosing over the war crimes of Russian soldiers, the Ukrainian media said in a statement.

The film ""Russians at War"" by Russian-Canadian documentary filmmaker Anastasia Trofimova was shown at the Venice Film Festival and is scheduled to be shown for the first time in North America at TIFF next week.
It was produced in collaboration with two Canadian public broadcasters, Ontario-based TVO and British Columbia-based Knowledge Network, and funded in part by the Canada Media Fund (CMF), a nonprofit that receives its funding from the government and telecommunications companies.

I remember seeing RT in disbelief on TV sets inside elevators in hotels in Las Vegas. Putin's team understood that disinformation could be fed to the public in small sound and video bites. They did this for 17 years, and when we finally realized something was off with the channel, we took it down and concealed it from public scrutiny and criminal investigations.

Most likely the applicants lied and misconstrued the purpose of the film.  Canada is a very strong supporter of Ukraine not just from the Feb 2022 invasion but has been providing military and financial aid to Ukraine since 2014.

CMF is a non profit that receives money from both the federal govt and industry, and its purpose is to seed both media and digital software production.

Quite plainly, the organization funding mechanism was abused.  This has to be recognized and reasoned discussion should acknowledge that fact and not construe that CMF deliberately set out to fund a ruzzian propaganda piece.

Canada is a democracy which places a high value on equitable conduct and freedom.  Furthermore virtually all of its principles of governance operate on the premise that participants are forthright individuals of good intention, morals and ethics.  The average Canadian deals with others on the basis that they will act reasonably and responsibly.

By the standards of most Canadians the last 10+ yrs have seen a very rapid change in how people interact, particularly in respect of more widespread duplicitous behaviour.   And quite simply the trust based foundation of most aspects of Canadian life have not kept up with this change.  This has evidenced itself several times recently in Canadian politics and media.

And although Canadians like I abhor the misuse that is occurring the question comes to mind: do we wish to change our systems to become more suspicious and operate intrinsically of the premise that the applicant is lying and deceitful?  What level of additional controls have to be implemented to perhaps arrive at a new ""happy medium""?

In my mind the issue is that if we have to change our society due to the actions of illicit individuals then in one context thee enemy has won.

ruzzia works hard to exploit the holes in ideals that free democracies cherish. All are now aware from revelations in the last week that ruzzia is devoting significant resources into propaganda and media influencing (despite the fact there have been repeated warnings over the last decade).  Exploiting good intentions of organizations such as CMF is just a wee little aspect of ruzzia's objectives.  Every success and the blowback assists in chipping away at trust in government institutions - and that breakdown in trust is ruzzia's ultimate goal, as then it leaves the whole of society weakened.

So don't be a victim to these goals of the enemy ruzzia.  While we seek to find ways to put a stopper on ruzzia's efforts understand the intent instead of blaming the victims.  Otherwise you just play right into enemy's goals, which are eradication of all the democratic principles we in the west cherish.",2024-09-08T16:31:37
1fbymee,"Russian propaganda film ""Russians at War"" whitewashes war crimes, funded by Canadian taxpayers: Discussion",duellingislands,3691,2024-09-08T14:08:20,CaptainSur,4,"I hardly know what to say to such a response.  There was nothing in my original comment that was ""triggered or defensive"" but rather information about the organization that provided the funding, and in the grand ""Discussion"" context thoughts about ruzzian propaganda, its goal of inciting attacks on democratic mechanisms and the importance of looking beyond headlines for understanding.  I would think your a trumper for this nonsensical reply to my comment but for the fact I know you are a staunch Ukraine supporter.  

I provided such ""Discussion"" after reviewing the other comments at the time I made my remarks, as it was clear some felt this might have been a deliberate act by CMF, that some thought CMF is a govt entity (it is not) and few were examining the motives that underlie the real intent of ruzzian propaganda - the message of the film is just the surface.

Now if more complex critical thought about goals that are in fact very much a long arc issue is not to your taste (or perhaps understanding) that is regrettable.   As it is the long arc that is of the utmost importance here.  If one cannot see the forest for the trees then one is blind to all but what is in front of them.  And that is a critical mistake to make in context of opposing ruzzia.  They are definitively playing the long game and have been since well before this war commenced (2014).",2024-09-08T18:35:36

One thing I remember from both Ukraine trips (a return trip when the kids were older) was how often fashion-modeling shows were on TV's.  Our flats TV had models on the runway.  Every electronic store had TV's with a model on the runway loop.  It was constant so I think it was important.  I spent a total of 5 weeks in Ukraine so I am likely very wrong.  Can Ukrainians tell me what is up with models and runway walking or is it no big deal?,2024-09-05T06:59:57

Cats especially breed like crazy. I ran a rescue and some places we took cats from they had 2-3 cats a year or two prior and despite losing many to illness they had 40-100 cats all because of the lack of neutering. Many people opt to shoot or kill them by other means and refuse to neuter so they don’t “run out of cats”. Ukraine is going to have a ton of cats and I’d imagine a lot of the rebuilding will be apartments which tend to have 0-2 pet restrictions rather than small homes.,2024-09-04T10:45:11

They haven't moved much for the last 1.5 years.  A little bit here and there at the cost of hundreds of thousands wounded.

Just for fun.  Because the FSB watches this channel for someone to be stupid with ops sec.  Time to throw in some dirt:

I can't wait for all those special ops that Ukraine slipped in across the border while the border checkpoint was taken.  Stolen car with some documents and presto.  They are sitting across from the airfields where the expensive shit is.   I'm sure they are ready to drone the hell out of it.  Then the oil refineries.  Can't make gas without a refinery right?  Replacement date?  2027-2028.  Terrible shame the hundreds of special ops that slipped past.

I remember joining Reddit after the first days of the invasion, in search of inside info, and searching and finding the r/Ukraine. I remember trying to post support in response to your first sun rising posts, about me having my coffee and feeling humbled and grateful for your sacrifices in defending and keeping the borders of your country and Europe safe, and a sense of luxury of us all being miles away from the violence of war and what Ukraine was enduring, with a burning sense of injustice.

I remember the Orange Revolution (I was rooting for you) and then I never heard much more after that. It really was as though the world did not think of you as a real country. I myself called it THE Ukraine and now, when I hear somebody call it that I kinda want to punch them, but I only correct them instead, and if they are receptive, I explain what is wrong with that moniker. In any case, I am very happy to be part of this Reddit community, and I'm very glad to send the help I do. Unfortunately the guys I am sponsoring took a bad hit recently and we haven't heard from them since. They were alive and I just hope they still are. Every day, I cheer for your victories and every day I am pained by the terrible atrocities being done to you. And every day I am glad to see a sunrise post. Thank you.

Day 100:  When I first heard A Duckling Swims.  I listen to it at least once a day so I can grieve for each needless murder, military or civilian, the little innocent Ukrainian ducklings, and those surviving who must carry the burden of their loss.

u/Lysychka- The personal memories of your father are so enlightening. And thank you for translating some of the Suspilne stories for the Reddit Ukraine community.  So many are never told.

I think there’s a chance that among Russians there are some good people and likely many unfortunate souls who’ve been forced to run at Ukrainian bullets—even if they did so thinking they were fighting a moral “special military operation”.  But my guess is that ordinary Russians can believe two opposing things at the same time.  1. They know that Putin is corrupt and that this is all wrong, 2. They know Putin is thier guy and he can do no wrong.
I think it takes a special level of fear, manipulation and coercion to get that many people to hold both views at the same time.  Ordinary Russians have been robbed of their wealth, their freedom and their critical facilities.

Many things are not disclosed :) Most, because we share a border with ruzzias Königsberg/Królewiec on the north and long border with Belarus on east. And only 80km long border with Lithuania on east north (Suwałki gap)

But neithgter the less we pay a tribute everyday. Most refugees from Ukriane still remain in Poland, and their lifes are payed from taxes, ours. I'm not against, in fact I'm for it.

And military agreements are undisclosed. Except one lately it came up, Ukraine builds their infantry trucks in Poland.

Poland, we keep mouth shut, just. Ukraine has only TWO direct friendly neighbours. Poland and Romania. Between are Hungary and Slovakia. And imagine where all the help is going thru? Thru hubs located in neighboring (friendly) countries.

Poland is a transportation hub from west and north including baltics. Romania perhabs is another hub from west and south (Italy &amp; balkan countires), Bulgaria and Türkiye if they don't ship it by Black Sea on inner turkish, bulgarian, romainan and Ukrainian waters.

I do not capitalize the “r” because ruzzia is not a proper noun, and the “zz” because they’re the nation of z’s now. This term to me differentiates ruzzia from Russia, and ruzzians from Russians. 

For example, ruzzians go to Ukraine to murder innocents. Their leader is a cowardly little bunker troll. Real Russians stay in their own country and commit courageous acts of defiance against their terrorist government. Real Russians fly a white/blue/white flag.

Also, this is another example of how Westerners (including myself) don't fully understand communism in a historical context. It's viewed much differently here, which erases the lives of people like Geo.

1dt4kvb,Debunking Common Myths About Ukraine: A Guide for Effective Conversations,UNITED24Media,428,2024-07-01T21:26:50,Mkwdr,17,Maybe it’s too complex for this format but the ‘fascism’ accusation is also common. It’s worth pointing out that many countries have right wing nationalists especially as a reaction to a history of Russian aggression. But right wing militias in Ukraine were both being dealt with and a fraction of the size of those such as the Wagner group in Russia. And right wing nationalist parties had a small and shrinking vote in elections - again far less than such types of parties in Russian elections?,2024-07-01T21:53:51
1dt4kvb,Debunking Common Myths About Ukraine: A Guide for Effective Conversations,UNITED24Media,428,2024-07-01T21:26:50,thegoodrichard,4,"In 2014 the DPR militias quickly got the upper hand when sympathizers in the UA defected, in many cases bringing their tanks, trucks, and artillery with them.  ""Aid convoys"" from Russia dispersed before crossing the border, distributing troops and equipment strategically before re-forming and arriving at their destinations half or 2/3 empty.  Losses from battle and defection were severe, but the Azov Brigade (right-wing militia that was not yet part of the army) provided much of the resistance that kept Russia from winning back then.  Are there still some neo-nazis in Azov Brigade?  Probably, but also probably not enough to still make it the defining characteristic.  Before he was killed, Yevgeny Prighozin said the story about Ukrainian nazis killing or abusing people in the occupied territories was a big lie, and those nazis did not exist.  Putin killed him for saying that, as much as for plotting any ""coup"", because that's the lie that justifies his whole war.",2024-07-02T07:45:05

Poroshenko made fun of Zelensky's poor Ukrainian during their election campaign, but apparently he is much more fluid now.  Until today I didn't know he had a law degree.
Edit: Where my mother's family lived near Mariupol, villages were settled along religious lines, so there were Orthodox villages, Jewish villages, and many Prussians lived in Lutheran villages (the church at Grunau was a big one), and they spoke their own languages and enough Russian and Ukrainian to get by.  Not long into the Russian Revolution, the churches and synagogues are being shut down, and all men and boys are required to learn to read and write Russian in school.

That left them needing a new name so they elevated the word “ukraïna” by insisting that it is just a name with no ""borderland"" meaning. I don’t think that “ukraïna” (as originally used in Ukraine) ever meant that the land was “the borderlands of moscow’s empire” so I don’t think it was necessary to try to redefine the term this way. To me, the English name ""The Ukraine"" is perfectly fine unless one allows themself to be troubled by moscow's imperial propaganda.",2024-07-02T18:10:39

For the ""Rus"" part. Rus was destroyed there was no such country or government. Even the term russia appeared much later in the history after Rus as a country disappeared. For some reasons russians decided that they are descendants of Rus, while the majority of them are descendants of tatars.

For the name of Ukraine it was never implied that Ukraine was the borderland of something, so there is no reason to have ""The Ukraine"" in the first place. Ukraine is not the land somewhere, it is a sovereign, independent country, so using ""The Ukraine"" is disgraceful in the first place.",2024-07-02T18:22:02

You bring the foam up once?  I was ""trained"" in Jordan that the process required 3 rounds of bringing up the foam.  Sugar added with the coffee and water before heating.  At least in Jordan the best coffee ""powder"" had cardamom already incorporated.  Fond memories of making ""Saba kahvesi"" at 0430 for about 10 (of 30 total) dig participants.

I never would have known something about the coffee culture in Ukraine being influenced by Turkey and about the Crimean Tatars. Thank goodness for Usein Bodanynsky for documenting this moment in history, despite the fate suffered.

Cold brew is another favorite in the US (well, one of my favorites at least). It’s taking a large amount of coarsely ground beans and soaking them in water for about 16 or 20 hours - brewer’s choice in terms of time and amount of beans. It’s like French press without heat and lots more time. As a result, the coffee tastes smooth and less acidic. Then add ice, a sweetener of choice, and cream if desired. A perfect beverage for summer!

The official title in Ukrainian is ""Марш Рівності"" (equality march, march for equality). The distinction is subtle but important.

Some news outlets mistakenly (purposefully?) reported this event as a gay parade. Many people picture gay parade as a colorful celebration in their heads. However, it is far from reality. There were no celebrations on this sober day in a country ravaged by an ongoing war.

The Equality March was focused on two goals: (i) a push for legislative support of civil partnerships and anti hate-crime laws and (ii) a fundraising event organized by LGBT+ military personnel.

Chef Klopotenko's book is now available in English!,duellingislands,183,2024-06-05T03:25:09,WabashCannibal,3,"Yes, I got it a couple weeks ago. It's really well done. I've tried several of the recipes and have been really pleased with the results. Great selection of dishes, though more desserts than I expected. Maybe that is just because I don't have much of a sweet tooth.

What impresses me most is how well the book is laid out. Almost every recipe is kept to a single page, with a photo of the dish on the opposing page. This makes such a difference in a practical cookbook: you can see your steps and ingredients at a single glance together with a visual of the finished result. None of this flipping-back-and-forth-while-you're-cooking nonsense, losing your place and getting red pepper puree and beetroot stains all over the pages (which I may or may not have ever done.)

Highly recommend!",2024-06-25T21:52:40

Of all the Sunrise Posts I've read since day 1, I somehow missed this one!  If the latest Razom for Ukraine newsletter hadn't mentioned the book, I'd continue to print out his recipes from the web which have pics interspersed w/ instructions - 5 pages for borsch if I didn't delete the images when saving.  Immediately ordered the book of course.

I've made his Lviv Cheesecake several times, even making the farmer's cheese (impossible to find now even though that's what all cheesecake in the '50s used - yes, I'm really old) - impressive results!  Looking most forward to the desserts as I love baking. and soups of course.

Back when we were all desperately looking for ways to support Ukraine, I bought *Babusya's Kitchen*, a 2022 published recipe book with reminiscences, made by returned Peace Corps volunteers as a fundraiser for Ukraine.  Will be interesting to compare as the volunteers were all over Ukraine, most in villages.  Don't believe it's in print any longer.

My pragmatic approach: favorite recipes found by the number of stains on the page :)

Thanks again!",2024-06-25T23:43:18

One in particular that got to me was a clearly starved pretty young woman (maybe 15 or 16)  who had managed to escape Mariupol after it had been under siege and made it to the Polish border. She was the only one from her family to make it out alive and appeared to have arrived at the border alone and traumatized. She was emaciated and looked like she hadn't eaten for weeks and was in a thin sweater insufficient for the cold.

Another photo I recall was of a small hatchback car with a dead cat curled up in the bottom front passenger seat and fragments of the owners teeth and jaw bone beside it. There were cannon holes in the back window from the Russians shooting through the window at a woman trying to get away from the invading Russian army and they shot her through the back of her head. Most of her body had been removed, but parts of her and her pet cat that the Russians also killed were left behind.

**Putin must be stopped by overwhelming force, now.** Urge your governments to confront Putin by force now. If they're too cowardly, then to donate arms and material to Ukraine's defense and the defeat of Russia's evil criminal horde now. In the meantime, while our governments dither and fail to do nearly enough to stop Putin's expansion of his criminal empire and genocidal invasion, donate to the only armed force actually putting their lives on the line to defend Ukraine and the entire free world at [https://u24.gov.ua/](https://u24.gov.ua/)",2024-06-03T17:03:39

Do you think these people/animals want to be away from their homes/family/friends while starving/dying? If you're in a Russian uniform/fighting for Russia, you're part of the war effort meant to exterminate/conquer a country and people that are fighting for it's very survival.

Most of the time the people claiming this are just going off the assumption that ""Surely it's just Putin who wants this war"" and ""if the Russian didn't fight they'd be killed.""

In reality the vast majority of the Russian population is either supportive or ambivalent towards both Putin and the war. The bulk of the Russian forces in Ukraine are volunteers who signed up because they were offered a lot of money to fight and most of them aren't conscripts. The punishment for refusing conscription is also just a few years in prison and while I certainly don't envy anyone in a Russian prison it is both a morally better option and potentially a safer option than going to fight in Ukraine.

I don't delight in anyone's death but I'm also not going to feel too sorry for the Russian soldiers who die in this war especially when they volunteered to fight or made no attempt to avoid mobilization.",2024-06-03T22:59:40

Sometimes later the oldest girl (maybe 14) said her mom and 4 yr old sister had been killed.

Basically the tl;dr here is Russia really can't build new artillery *en masse* — they build it, but on a slow, artisanal pace.  Part of it is that their industry shifted to that basis over the last 50 years; part of it is that to add a devastating ""insult to injury"", they lack the **inputs** as a country — Artillery crossed a threshold something like a century ago, where you can't just build a barrel out of regular metal.

The rise of modern metallurgy coincided right at the same time as things like Dynamite were being invented.  ""High explosives"" (dynamite being one of numerous examples) are vastly more powerful than gunpowder — obviously, if you could *put them in a cannon*, the blast being (say) 10x stronger would mean your shot would travel 10x further (not really, but we're *ludicrously* simplifying the math to get the point across).   It was an insane opportunity, but if you did this with regular metal, the blast would be so strong it'd rip the gun to pieces the moment you tried to fire, killing all the operators.

You needed a special steel that was, itself ""10x (or whatever)"" stronger, to hold together and direct the blast.   Fortunately high explosives came out right at the same time we were making terrific advances in metallurgy, and further advances in both have crept in over the years.

--

Getting large quantities of this special steel is really hard, now for Russia, since they shut down their domestic production ages ago.   They can get it, there's just never enough.

Can they still produce artillery?  Absolutely.    Can they do a Stalin-style ""we need rows of factories churning out 50,000 of these a year""?  Absolutely not.   **The critical thing is that it's looking like the production rate is well below the loss rate**.   The prime indicator for this is that the *spread* of gear is consistently shifting its bias to include older and older stuff — stuff that's just overwhelmingly inferior, and is stuff you'd never ever have a sane reason to *choose* to use; you'd only ever use it if you had no other choice.

--

Russia will never run out of artillery; there will always be fresh ones rolling over the assembly line.   It's like a bathtub, where the faucet is running, but the drain is open.   If there's more flow through the drain than the faucet, eventually that tub will empty even if the faucet is always running.  We'll eventually hit a point where they only have a small amount of artillery, like the little puddle on the bottom of any sink/tub with an open drain and a running faucet.",2024-05-29T10:15:52

Modern artillery and rifle propellants (smokeless powder and the like) do not explode like black powder does. Instead they burn at increasing rates as the pressure increases. So a charge at the breach as it is ignited by the primer is at zero pressure but that rapidly increases in burn rate and pressure as the projectile moves up the barrel for the 22 millisecond travel time in barrel so that the pressure is on the order of 50,000 to 65,000psi at the muzzle for a projectile leaving at 2700fps.  But you are correct the steel needs to withstand that 60,000 psi over the entire length of the barrel.",2024-05-29T14:05:16

Yeah; it's wild looking back at the history of firearms; a lot of people don't realize that a large number of historical firearms, even during the ""middle era"" of gunpowder, could be shockingly DIY/homemade stuff.    The Swedes famously pursued building cannons out of *leather* (crimped in place with iron bands, but ... *Leather!),* and quite a few places (like Vietnam) made mortars out of very large blocks of wood.

*Ironically*, this even gets a portrayal in a fairly modern Russian ""historical fantasty"" film, where a Russian settlement/Kreml improvises a leather cannon, when it unexpectedly comes under attack — this, *after* the authorities had levied all the big guns and taken them out of the town to be used where they expected the actual fighting to happen:  [https://youtu.be/7dnZTZxZBnk?t=5255](https://youtu.be/7dnZTZxZBnk?t=5255)",2024-05-31T06:33:42

They had one big cannon ,probably a 36 pounder but no cannon balls to fit it. They tried wrapping smaller balls with leather but the leather ripped off at the muzzle and the shots fell short. Meanwhile the British ship of the line was dismantling the town from a safe distance. Then one errant shot from a British 36 pounder went skipping through the waves and rolled up onto the beach smoking hot. That ball was soon picked up and loaded into the American cannon and a well aimed shot hit the UK ship well enough that it had to withdraw saving the town.

They're months away from non-replacement of losses. Replacement will only be what they can produce or buy, and that's going to be under 1,000 pieces a year.",2024-05-28T18:27:53

SPGs are mounted on tank chassis so need hulls from the graveyards as a starting point so are in competition with the tank refurbishment factories. There may of course been one to three thousand pieces stored indoors out of sight of satellites not counted.

I have seen no reliable figure on current production of SPGs , towed pieces or even just replacement barrels but the fact they shipped in trainloads of old towed artillery from North Korea tells me they are getting close to exhausting their own stock.",2024-05-29T14:17:07

NATO doctrine is based off of having less pieces of equipment that work better, more often, than say russian equipment 

The losses in this war for russia are evidence that it is a sound military doctrine. We are using Cold War era technology to absolutely obliterate anything the russians have produced, including their modern weaponry

As to the volume that russia produces, that is irrelevant. What matters is that we are destroying more than they can build, not that we are building more more than them

Just look at the numbers. Do they have more artillery or less artillery than the start of the war?

They have worked down their Soviet era stockpiles, and no matter how much they want to pretend, russia is not the Soviet Union. They will never, ever replenish those numbers. They will never ever come close, they couldn't in 100 years

**—however—**

That didn't mean they were planning to *quit*; it meant they had a ""surge, bite, and hold"" strategy; a ""pitbull"" maneuver.   Such a thing would have a few distinct phases:

1\] the initial ""we could take it all"" invasion

2\] the reassessment.   They decide they can't take it all, *but* there IS a window of a few years before Ukraine strengthens up.   So during this window they literally try to throw everything they've got at it, all the old equipment, everything they can find.   Push for this period of time until they can't get any further.   Once Ukraine gets more and more warfighting gear, and Russia runs low, it's not worth trying to advance — but until then there's an opportunity, so take it.

3\] at some point, they assess that they can't go further, so now the objective is to just defend.

*In theory*, this would be an awful strategy because by the time you reached #3, your troops would be broken and unable to defend.  I think that Russia's assessment is that by being profligately willing to spend men, they can continue to defend (despite horrendous losses), no matter how hard Ukraine tries to counterattack in the next few years, and that they won't break on the battlefield.   No matter how bad the losses are, they think they can just surge in new replacements fast enough that there won't be a repeat of UA's breakthrough from '23.

It'll be a shitty consolation prize, but I think they expect the land will be Russia's forever by hiding behind the spooky nuclear shield — since nobody would *start* a conflict with them (UA's only fighting because the conflict was forced upon them).

It's a dangerous gamble, because troop mutiny's a thing that's toppled multiple empires, 1-2 of which were Russian.   They're putting the ""load-bearing"" of their war's stress on their troops (rather than just, say, their economy), and just kinda hoping they don't have a bad dice roll on mutiny for the next 3-6 years.",2024-05-29T10:32:59

In many ways, it was like Stalin's genocide worked and we were erased. I can't describe how glad it makes me to see it being undone...

1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,tallalittlebit,66,"Hey everyone! Thanks to Chosen Company for helping us fundraise!

Protect a Volunteer supports the most effective volunteer efforts in Ukraine. We support mostly military efforts but some humanitarian as well. We do this through directly matching donors with volunteers in order to help them afford gear or flights. We also fundraise for specific teams. If you would like to donate, here is how:

1. The website is [www.protectavolunteer.com](http://www.protectavolunteer.com). If you would like to sign up to be directly matched with a volunteer (including our lads from Chosen Company, please click the links on the site and a volunteer will get in contact with you.
2. You can directly donate to specific causes via our Paypal. Here are the options:

General Fund: This is for emergencies. This week we used some funds to get gas masks for a GUR team. We use this at our discretion when teams reach out for urgent needs and usually assist Ukrainian units.

3rd Assault Brigade: These funds go to Ukraine's famous 3rd Assault Brigade. Jackie, an American volunteer who trains with them and has worked with PAV for a long time, determines how to best spend them.

Loveable Bozos (Chosen Company): Want to support our lads in Chosen Company? This is the way. We mainly help them afford night vision and scopes.

Laser Kiwi Boys: A fan favorite, this is the team with the famous Laser Kiwi flag. It is a special forces team that PAV has worked with over a year.

Team Mars: A highly effective foreign team that stays under the radar.

Droney McDroneface: A specialized drone team. PAV has worked with them for over a year.

Sergei's Unit: This supports a Ukrainian team led by Sergei, a paramedic featured in the 20 Days in Mariupol documentary.

CivMed Evacuations: This supports the crucial efforts of Augustae Annia, a tiny but extremely effective NGO delivering supplies to the front line and military hospitals.

Please note that we are NOT a 501c3 organization as we cannot be given the aid we provide. However, we are partnered with some organization that are. If you would like to make a donation but need a 501c3 for tax purposes or corporate matching, please get in touch with me and depending on what you would like to support we can make that happen.",2024-05-20T11:25:33

Were always on the market for med supplies as those do get used but we also can use weapon attachments especially suppressors.  In country you can get some cheap ones for around 6000 uah but as we found out on a op that when you fire rapid rounds the suppressor will cause weapon malfunctions and stoppages.  When you're in an enemy trench it's nice to have your shots muffled but nicer to have your rifle function properly.  That being said the proper quality suppressors are around 25k uah but theyre also made for combat and the ammo we put through them.  Med supplies help patch us up but killing the enemy before they can put holes in us is much preferred.  On top of suppressors, thermal sights are a huge help in spotting the enemy and putting them down well before they know we're there.",2024-05-20T11:55:02

Non-profits and any kind of charities have restrictions on what you can purchase to help the military. Understandable.

But let me try to explain my pov on that, put some nuance on it.

I’ve been donating regularly for a variety of things: stoves, water reservoirs, flood lights, meds, protective clothing, surgery, food, (animal) evacuation, …

Only on like 2-3 occasions have I donated directly towards a lethal purchase, e.g. nvg.

Lethal, it just doesn’t sit right with me to donate towards as a civilian. That’s where my (many) taxes are for. Imo governments are the ones that should provide Ukraine and you guys with whatever you need in that department. (and yes I know, there’s a big caveat here …) I not only fully support that, it’s a prerequisite: my vote in June will depend on who’s willing to send.

Plus, I feel like there’s plenty of people who ARE willing to cofund such purchases, no? (I hope)

Besides, in my view any active donor - or even any active supporter of Ukraine, even in the form of just Reddit comments - goes a long way towards influencing public opinion. Towards keeping the focus, by being a catalyst in his/her environment.

But, you’re the one who’s risking his neck over there, so I tip my hat to you Sir, and thus you may categorize me as whatever you wish ;-) Be safe, and give them hell!!",2024-05-21T06:42:10

There's a lot of people that have similar views and that's how she goes.  For us on the ground you get to see that what we need gets to us and not lost to another unit for some other reason.  I think nvgs and thermals are possibly the most common asked for items and are also costly aswell.  As I agree soldiers should have them I don't think all should.  There's a need for them on the front but also they need to be maintained and trained on them.  They're a mission essential piece of equipment and some guys are careless and break them just from ignorance and inexperience with them.  Also they don't stand up well to getting blown up so they need to be replaced when destroyed or damaged.  They'll always be needed.  The good thing with donating to someone you're talking to is you know where they're going and that they're being used and not just going to be used to make someone look cool or sold on the side for beer money.,2024-05-21T07:32:04

We do indeed have countermeasures in place to prevent these people from getting into Chosen. An extensive and intricate vetting process being key to that.

Obviously some people like that do slip through the net and get into the company. If they don't meet the requirements or they're just not fit for the company they are moved on.

As for people wanting to come to us, the attraction resides in the eye of the beholder.

When we first came together as a unit we had to spend time to learn from each other. See what makes us tick as a unit. I remember when I first walked through the door back in early Summer 2023, and there was a slight air of caution in the room. We were still in that learning phase, kinda keeping to ourselves, scoping the place out. Then after a few ops, we bled together, grieved together, shared the same victories and losses. That shaped us as a unit. Brought us together. We've gone through things most people will never go through with their own work colleagues. Experiences like this shape people. War changes people.

2. Also dependent on unit and what they have available. But that's why groups like PAV fill a lot of the shortages through donations. Also, don't fall for the laser trap. Works both ways.

3. Also depends on unit haha. But regardless of platform, accessories are plentiful. Some can be marked up pretty high though especially if it's from the west.

lock it up, keep accountability, and be in a trushtworthy unit, also dont take your whole life with you, jsut take what you need and one or two comforts.

2)Difficult and depends on availability, generally i suggest until you are really proficient with them, you let ppl use it that wont lose or break them or that will make use of them the right way.  
Also keep in mind, if you lose them to Storm Z vs if you lose them to trained troops.

3)Yes, everything has a price though.

4)depends on your role, unit and ambition, everything is a little bit up to you and the motivated people in the general units.

Barbaric tactic when you don't care for the lives youre sending into battle.

Wagner guys are still around just not under Wagner command, they were absorbed into the Russian military so there are times you'll find Wagner patches on the corpses, so you know there are remnants around but they're still being killed off.

It's always a bit surreal to see all the dead and that Russians will just continue to walk through them.  I'm more curious what is going through their mind being sent in waves knowing the previous wave is laying on the ground you're walking on.",2024-05-20T12:57:27

How many grenades do you guys usually carry on a trench assault? I recall seeing at around 20(?) going off in one of your videos a while back and wondered how many you guys were carrying at the time.   
How many different types of grenade do you use? I'd imagine you'll generally use a lot of russian/soviet grenade variants due to both sides having stockpiles.  
Do you guys have any preference on which grenade you guys use? Between things like comfort or dud rates what makes it preferable? (as I remember (one of?) your Australian ""Dave"", was calling out a dud in a video; mildly curious as to what kind of grenade it was)

How many different western weapons do you guys usually use? I've seen a decent number of what look like the Czech Bren 2s in use, but it's mostly just those and M4's  
Would you guys prefer using the AK platform or prefer to use western guns (as a personal preference)  
Do you find AK's or western equipment easier to manipulate when pushing trenches?

Being Australian I've got to ask, how many Australians and Kiwis do you guys have or interact with? Also do you have many members from said nations? Wishing them all well from back home.

Those are just the first major questions that came to mind. Sorry for the number of them: there's a number of things I'm curious about with this.   
You guys are all awesome and I wish you all good luck and hope that you guys will make it home safe.

So, generally speaking, you're looking at between 4-8 grenades. Your role will determine that. Then you still have smokes, incendiary, high explosives, Claymores.

We've gone through all sorts of grenades. To many to list all the different types. I personally prefer the Russian f1 grenades. 

Several different western weapons. Much like grenades, too many to list. I would rather take AK over M4. Cz Bren 2 over AK. Manipulation comes down to the skill level of the user. I'm not a fan of certain aspects of the AK but would still take it over an M4.

Yes, we have aussies and kiwis. Several, I just won't go into numbers.

1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,ChosenCasEvac,12,"I am very happy you asked this question.

Major blood loss is still the number one cause of mortality.  
I would say there should be more focus on the skills to manage this, especially junctional wounds do not receive enough training attention.

I strongly believe early TXA, calcium and blood transfusions (buddy to buddy or fresh whole) need to be implemented into CLS and then ALS level.

In terms of medical gear, any form of quick clot and TQs are used rapidly.  
Chest seals probably on spot 3 preceded by Israeli bandages.

overlooked items are ACE bandages.  
Israeli bandages are a scam and expensive and do not work very well on junctions.  
Junctional TQs are a rarity to see, active warming solutions are still quite missing as well.  
Igels are quite popular now but were a rarity up until around summer.

Ineffective gear   
Honestly, misinformation, ill preparation and so many fake medics as well as so many fake medics that use drugs like there is no tomorrow, just because they are not supervised.  
There is some cases of ineffective TQs from chinese knock off companies or ineffective clotting gauze that isnt actual clotting gauze, but id say the majority of inefficiency comes from a lack of education, a lack of repetition and the consequently following inability to react.

Also NPAs have no use in TCCC in my opinion, but that is up to studys to decide.",2024-05-20T17:37:46

From the perspective of a person in the field, what would you recommend for realistic training for physical activities, for someone preparing to come? I’m not talking about shooting drills, I’m talking day-to-day stuff I can simulate to get my muscles ready for being effective. What do you think about the following, and do you have any other suggestions-

1) Rucking 100 pounds progressively longer distances, 3.5-4 mph. Up to 3 miles without a break. Takes a little less than an hour. 

2) what distances are we discussing where you really need to be able to fucking hoof it with a full load? Is 100 pounds too much for this purpose?

3) arm strength— if anyone else is looking for cheap ways to simulate the weight of a typical grenade/shape to throw around, the best/cheapest analogue I have found are two/three pound cannonball fishing weights. Exactly what it sounds like. Two pounds is where grenades usually top out in weight. I figure if I get my throwing muscles really strong by throwing those a couple hundred times a day, that’s a plus. What’s the most effective throw? Do you guys just end up heaving them like heavy baseballs, or is there more of a form to it?

4) trench digging. No explanation needed on what’s being simulated. My wife and back yard hate me. My son loves me. My son and I are working on a pit which has turned into a pick and rock bar job through bedrock. What should I be practicing to dig trenches most effectively?

5) Prioritizing training- AK platform, or NATO/Western rifles? 

6) shotguns- I hear there is a shortage over there, because people Are starting to use them for drones. True, or no? There are shitloads of shotguns in the US, can they be sent without violating ITAR? Would clayshooting be good practice?

I recognize the 100 lbs is overkill for an op, I figure if I get used to a shitload of weight a normal load on an op will be cake. I could only think of one scenario where I might actually overload like that, and welcome your thoughts on that, as well. On the initial trip to a posting I intend to carry heavy packs to bring as much stuff as I can to share with my unit. Is this a useful and good idea, or is this stupid? 

As an example, I see dudes digging trenches in relatively relaxed settings, with a trench shovel. If my pack is 60 lbs and I have room to spare on the way to a post, I would consider bringing a maddox or pick; or even a gas-powered handheld jackhammer for digging. Or maybe just a shitload of extra food, or even amenities people who will have been posted a long time in one place do not have.

1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,FoxxyFrost,9,"Personally,

I would go no more then 45-50lbs (dry) in a ruck. Make sure you have good boots that are broken in. A good test of endurance that you really should benchmark is being able to complete a 12 mile ruck in 3 hours or less with 45lbs dry and full kit if possible. 

As for your 2nd paragraph. Im sure you will get a trench or some sort of E-tool. Your unit might distribute picks or other shit to carry with you while your going to a PB/OP or trenchline but you wouldnt bring that to an assault. I would not even consider brining a jackhammer not even a little bit. Your gonna need that extra room for your other gear. In the infantry you'll learn really quickly that if your stopped for any amount of time, you'll start digging in fast with a shovel. 

Note while I have not been to Ukraine the same fundamentals and principles of being an infantryman do apply there.

PS.I would actually prioritize physical fitness above marksmanship training or any other training. People dont realize how exhausting being in the Infantry really is, and how much it sucks lol. I could probably take a group of Randoms and teach them how to move, shoot, and communicate in a day. Fitness is a lifetime.

You are the second person to cite the 12 mile/3 hour standard. That’s definitely what I would love to do with 100 pounds, but likely unrealistic. When I plateau with the 100 lbs I will switch to 65 pounds and increase distance. When you say “dry” you mean no canteen? Or literally wearing dry clothing? Full load “wet” about 65 pounds?

Fitness  
in terms of fitness, I recommend doing things that are available to you in austere environments.  
For me that is running, stretching and kettlebells.  
Your shoulders and hips are likey going to be carrying the majority of weight and stress.  
I highly recommend TBphysio on instagram,   
Enhanced tactical performance is quite interesting as well.

Think of your back muscles as well, as your plate carrier is gonna weigh down in it when prone.

Shotguns  
Id guess any kind of training, is going to be really good for you if it furthers your reaction speed and accuracy, however a lot of drones are too high up for shotguns.

Trenches,  
I dont want to give away SOPS, but think of the most dominant threats on the battlefield and how to coexist.

1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,Alex3mercian,5,"Hiya mate. Well for a start off, it's great that you're training. A lot of people don't bother doing anything at all before coming here. But silly of them really! But I'm gonna be honest with you dude. Being in the most hottly contested country fighting against a better equipped, much more numerically superior force requires conditioned soldiers. People who have an actual military background and served a few years at least, preferably even did a combat tour. When you fight against russian forces you need to be able to move tactically on the battlefield. You need to know how and when to look for openings and exploit them. These aren't things that you can practice at home. Only in a military training environment over a period of time. Throwing grenades, rucking and shooting are only a very small part of an enormous job, and the less of that job you can do, the more the people around you will have to pick up in order to compensate. Unfortunately a lot of people come here with minimal or no prior military experience and they very quickly become a burden on their unit. I've actually known people get other people killed through lack of experience which is tragically unfortunate but it's a huge problem here.",2024-05-21T05:26:24
1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,bgeorgewalker,2,"I completely understand. I recognize I lack necessary military tactical training. I can’t really get that at home, which is why I’m focusing mainly on conditioning and things I can control. I study manuals and watch videos on small unit tactics, but I hear you loud and clear on real life experience. My assumption is I would go straight into whatever is the equivalent of boot camp upon arrival, and then assigned to an appropriate unit after training. 

Are you suggesting I should reconsider and not come because I would probably be more of a drain than help? I’m not coming for glory or fun, so if I’m accomplishing the opposite of helping by coming, I wouldn’t. But if that’s what you are suggesting, why would a raw Ukrainian conscript not necessarily happy to be fighting, be preferable to a civilian volunteer who is physically qualified and willing? Does it take more resources/logistics to train/accommodate foreign volunteers than Ukrainians? Is the language barrier a significant enough issue to make foreign volunteers not worth the resources?

I’m really not trying to be an asshole, don’t misunderstand. I really want to understand your thought process, because it makes me think I have not considered something. If I show up and they tell the most helpful thing for me to do is dig trenches all day setting up fallback positions in the rear, so be it. If you think staying at home would still be more useful than coming over and at least digging trenches, well, you’re breaking my heart, but let me hear the unvarnished opinion.

I’m training my body so it’s conditioned for extremely strenuous activity. That’s all I can really control. I don’t have an issue with putting myself in harms way; but as you said, other people’s mistakes can get you killed just as easily. I don’t want to get anybody (on our side) killed, but by the same token, I don’t want a doofus on our side getting me killed unnecessarily. I don’t have any illusions of grandeur in terms of “skills” or lack thereof. 

If you are not completely discouraging me from coming— I just want to be with a unit with a mindset aligned with my own, so I don’t get stuck with a bunch of goofballs who accidentally get me hurt; glory seekers who think they are the light brigade; or losers who think they are helping by being there, but are doing jack shit. Nothing is beneath me in terms of assignments, but I would certainly want to be assigned to a unit with like-minded folks who want to get shit done— whatever it is, whether digging trenches or storming them. You have any thoughts on where someone like me might be a good fit?",2024-05-21T13:10:39
1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,Alex3mercian,3,"You've kinda hit the nail on the head there mate. Unfortunately Ukraine doesn't really do boot camps as such. They simply don't have the time or the resources. When Ukrainian volunteers and conscripts are done with their medicals they go straight to a unit and jump on with training for a few weeks before being deployed. Unfortunately, some dont even get those few weeks. As a foreigner coming into Ukraine, you'll be expected to bring some form of experience, something valuable to the table. Inexperienced young Ukrainian soldiers quite often need to look to us to lead the way. We're expected to orchestrate what goes on around them and that requires quite extensive experience. As a foreigner, to just turn up with the intention of helping but then immediately need to be tutored, fed, clothed &amp; sheltered without bring anything special to the table is counterproductive. It essentially just makes you another mobilised troop, which Ukraine already has a lot of. Acquiring contracts and admin stuff for foreigners is also 10x harder and more long winded for the Ukrainian admin teams than it is for Ukrainian men.

Another point you brought up was the language barrier. It can be a huge problem, even for me and I've been here since the start of the war and I can speak a little bit of Ukrainian (certainly not proficient, it's an insanely hard language to learn). Not being able communicate on the zeroline can be detrimental. Speaking English over comms devices also let's the russians know there's foreigners in the area as well which is particularly dangerous.

I'm definitely not trying to discourage you, I actually admire your determination and your willingness to listen. My advice would be to join your military back home. Gain a wealth of experience. Tactical knowledge, disciplines and all the other invaluable things it takes to make a soldier. Then when you've done your time there, if you think this is still for you, you can give it a shot. You need to make mistakes to learn. Make your mistakes in the safety of your respective military. Mistakes only get people killed here.

Just bare in mind mate, Ukraine is the very deepest of the deep end when it comes to the world of combat. Even the most seasoned soldiers can very quickly get out of their depth here. Nobody becomes a soldier overnight, it often takes months to even years of constant conditioning. Always listen to those around you. Keep an open mind. Work hard and become a good soldier. This war is going nowhere any time soon. It'll still be here when you're ready to head here yourself.",2024-05-23T07:21:22

Usually westerners who came over in the early days of the war, not wanting to fight but wanting to feel 'important' in a sense. So they bodged a gap in the system that required the training of soldiers.

I've personally visited one of these training establishments and had to pull half the staff off the job because of the stupid shit they were teaching Ukrainians. Stuff that will 1000% get people killed. There's also a lot of people who claim to be 'medics, nurses &amp; doctors' training people up who don't even know how to apply a tourniquet.

1.0) How do volunteer forces like Chosen determine leadership in the company? 

1.2) To what extent do roles generally in the company emulate or differ from conventional military? (e.g. section leader, gunner, rifleman)   

2.0) When Chosen are planning an operation whats one of the best assets to have that aids in success ? 

3.0) This war has evolved in a few ways since onset, one has been the rise of drones in a big way. Are drones becoming the future of fighting on a battlefield or does EW have the final word on that?

1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,ChosenDirtyP,3,"Leadership is determined by the teams and unit overall.  Some people are good leaders.  Other people seem to think they should leave but can't find their way out of a paper bag.  Within chosen we have some very experienced guys so our leadership is pretty much set by now and as we grow that will grow too.  

Roles tend to be the same.  I was a rifleman that ended up as pkm my last go.  So I had an AG on most ops.  Most of the ops the AG was good to go.  I had one that was absolutely dog water.  Guys train for their roles for an op for each op.  Sometimes your roles change up.  Being willing to jump into different roles is good.  Not all ops will need a 50 gunner but that doesn't mean you can't run as an at or rifle.  

Our leadership is our best asset I'd say.  We have a lot of trust and brotherhood built into our unit and that bond plays a big role in trusting eachother.  Equipment would be drone support we have access to but I'm sure most units will say that haha.  If you have some good drone pilots then those boys can be better than artillery.

Drones and EW are in an arms race.  I think it'll be the future of warfare for the next while until one side defeats the other.  Russians were using tethered drones for a bit, those aren't affected by ew but you have a tether trailing the drone.  Not the greatest solution.  It'll be an interesting and deadly game of cat and mouse to see which side pulls ahead that's forsure.",2024-05-20T23:08:19

Surprised to learn of this. The image that came to mind was a drone trailing a cable hundreds of meters long in the sky, which does sound problematic - or were they using the tether in a shorter range capacity? 

I could imagine something tethered within the tens of meters range of close fighting being used to look into a nearby building or guide a grenade into a trench",2024-05-21T00:05:28

There's multiple ways the explosives or payloads can be activated and armed.  For fpvs you can see in a lot of videos some sort of metal ring device and what that does is complete a circuit on impact which sets off the payload.  That one's simple.

My questions revolve around the experience of working with civilian/non-military background fighters.    
  
\* Knowing that CC does not or rarely recruits those without real-world experience, can you speak on your experience with the civilian-crowd as a whole?    
  
\* Have you noticed anything that separates the LARPers from people who didn't know they were soldiers?   
  
\* What is the relationship between veterans and the new soldiers, is there animosity, lack of trust?

I can understand the media does not want to promote civilians quitting their jobs and running to war, but I have to believe that there is a percentage of civilians that go, who are there to do the work, and are able to excel in their combat roles.",2024-05-21T02:05:29
1cwd04k,AMA with Chosen Company,horunzhij,602,2024-05-20T11:13:07,FG_Johno,3,"1. Civilians have been a flip of the coin. Mixed bag type of thing. Good discipline, bad fighter. Good fighter, bad discipline. Good at both, bad at both. It's a hit or miss. We've gone away from recruiting civilians for the most part. The reason being, with civilians you generally have to start from scratch and all that. We just don't have time for that. We need guys who understand already the fundamentals of basic tactics, operational planning, training, etc etc. With us, you're going to hit the ground running. 

2. LARPers will be useless and it's noticeable very quickly. Almost immediately.

3. No animosity. No lack of trust. I would say for the most, there's a baseline of trust and respect everyone starts at when they arrive. Through training, it builds up as long as you perform. You show up, you're integrated with the group. Do some fighting, and you'll always have a place in the family. New guys aren't treating like privates in basic. NCO's take out the trash as well.
