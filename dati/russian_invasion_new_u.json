Specifically he keeps saying how there have been violent repressions against ethnic Russians in Ukraine since the Maidan. For context I'm Bulgarian.\n\nI've tried looking up information about these alleged repressions and all I've found is articles from Russian media outlets which instinctively makes me think this is just Russian state propaganda to justify the funding of the Donbas separatists and the subsequent invasion. I want to know if there's any amount of truth to this or if my dad's brain is just cooked. He keeps comparing it to our situation with Macedonia and I just don't want to argue with him for the billionth time.",

Like, you guys used to have russian language and literature classes at school just a few decades ago, didn’t you? And russia has a habit of using those kind of “russian culture lovers clubs/classes” as its soft power, pushing imperialistic narratives in-between the lines.\n\nI’ve also heard those narratives aren’t tolerated in Bulgaria these days and that’s really a big step. But that doesn’t cancel out the two older generations that have already soaked in the narrative and might push it upon younger people who avoided the Soviet period.\n\nHonestly, I believe most people around 40 or older aren’t prone to changing their mind, so there might be nothing to be done. Just keep on educating yourself and researching the topics, reach out in this community if you have any doubts.\n\nTo answer your question: no, there have been no violent oppressions. In-between 2014 and 2022 (8 years in the war on the eastern front) Ukraine has finally removed russian language’s status of one of the official ones in the country and it finally stopped being taught in schools. Those kinda laws appeared. But that barely affected the lives of russian-speaking citizens and ethnic russians. That I can tell and actually show you first hand :)\n\nSo in case you want to change your dad’s mind, I invite you and him to come to Ukraine.

Their testimony in the Hague helped in the prosecution of Putin for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  If Putin really is the good guy how come he's a war criminal?\n\nThe \"Little Green Men\" were ready because for years they were actively involved in false flag attacks on civilians in the Donbas.   Take for example the testimony of Igor Salikov, an officer of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).\n\n[https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/)\n\n&gt;Having been involved in Russia’s war against Ukraine since 2014, Salikov witnessed Russia’s covert takeover and hybrid warfare in eastern Ukraine. In a bombshell interview with with founder Vladimir Osechkin, he tells how chief puppetmaster Vladislav Surkov carefully constructed the fiction of a “Donbas uprising,” how he and other Russian proxies were allowed to use only legacy Soviet equipment to avoid giving Russia away, and how Russia conducted shelled its own territory to frame Ukraine, constructing the Big Lie of a “Donbas genocide.” \n\nBefore the war, the number of civilian deaths in the Donbas was declining and nothing like what it now is due to Putin's blatant shameless war of aggression.\n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/)\n\n&gt;Prior to the war, fighting took place in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and separatist forces supported by the Russian government. Over the course of 2021, 25 conflict-related deaths were recorded in Ukraine. Between April 14 and December 31, 2014, the number of killed civilians exceeded 2,084. These include 298 victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) which was shot down in July 2014.\n\nI'm guessing your dad doesn't care about the 298 civilians killed when a commercial plane was shot down by the DPR in July 2014.   They don't count because they're not 'ethnic Russians'.\n\nIf Putin cared a jot about civilian deaths would he now be levelling villages, towns and cities across Ukraine?  Even Trump has admitted Putin's response to his peace talks is to launch mass attacks against civilians night after night after night.",

As a matter of fact, before Maidan, in 2012, pro-Russian politicians brought to power by the Kremlin passed the infamous \"Kivalov-Kolesnichenko\" law, which heavily expanded \"regional\" languages and gave more power to the Russian language. It pretty much allowed regional languages to be used as official language if more than 10% of the region spoke the language. It was revoked in 2014. The biggest thing that really changed for an average person after it was revoked was that any official forms or documents would have to be completed in the national language, Ukrainian. Which was the case anyway before 2012. Documents were done in two languages anyway - Ukrainian and Russian. Not just in the region, but throughout Ukraine. \n\nIt affected nothing else pretty much. Russian books weren't banner, Russian TV was still available via cable or antennas if the coverage was there, and so on. \n\nWho really suffered in Ukraine for DECADES are people choosing to speak Ukrainian in urban areas, heavily Russified over the Soviet period. Especially in the east, in places like Donbas. People would be ridiculed and mocked. I had a colleague like that in Donetsk. She moved from Lviv with her husband for work and spoke Ukrainian her whole life. Now, the immediate circle was great, as everyone was more or less educated and a decent human being. But I'd still catch people \"from the outside\" throwing glances at her once they heard her speak. She'd often be treated with dumb \"bandera\" jokes or other stupid comments. She often spoke about harassment and bullying. \n\nAs a mirror example, her husband was a Russian speaker who grew up in Lviv, but never really felt oppressed. \n\nEverything else is manufactured propaganda. Russians are good at playing the victim card and too many people buy into that shit. Remind your dad that Hitler used the same type of excuse to start WWII. \"Defending ethnic ABC\\_XYZ\" and all that bullshit is nothing new.",

You can't communicate with a lunatic. P.S. I was born in Russia so I surely would have experience supposed \"repressions\" against Russians if they were real. They are not. If anything, under Russian occupation (including Soviet occupation) Ukrainians were always persecuted in Ukraine for their ethinicity just for refusing to accept Russian identity. In Donbass region, where I lived, even after the fall of the Soviet Union persecution of Ukrainian identity was encouraged by local criminal authorities that had close connections with Russia.",

I don’t know why or what problem fyroms have with Bulgaria, I can see how your dad thinks that communism “created” them, the same way ruzzian ppl believe Ukrainians were created by communism. I would maybe lay into the fact that the fyrmaceos are taking two people’s cultures. While Ukraine is really the predecessor to the god forsaken ruzzian people. With Volodymyr in Kyiv and his three sons fighting for Kyiv and starting new settlements. So maybe a stretch you could say which is true for Ukrainians is that russians want Ukrainian history while Ukrainians don’t want their name to be linked to the atrocities of russia.

If your dad was working in the 80s, had active social life, you kids were young - and now he’s retired, social life is just hanging out with other old folks and watching tv/reading facebook… sure the 80s was better, so it’s easy to think it was because of communism. Being in the Soviet sphere but on the periphery was also way better than being in Russia itself. I mean compare growing up in Sofia in the 1960s or 70s vs let’s say Chelyabinsk (same size city in Russia) at the same time, Sofia seems like paradise by comparison. Add to that Russians are still seen in very positive light in Bulgaria because of the liberation from the Turks, so the idea of them conquering anyone causes a lot of cognitive dissonance there in particular\n\nThe main bit of advice I have is just watch “Servant of the People” with him over some rakiya. It has Zelensky playing the main character, it’s hilarious (if you grew up in old soviet republic) and it’s in Russian. Also was super popular show on Ukrainian TV in 2015-2016. So any kind of “Russians are oppressed” story is kinda obvious bs just from that\n\nP.S. I say the show is in Russian but that’s not entirely true, it goes back and forth sometimes so quickly you can miss it. From what I remember in the opening scene Zelensky (playing a school teacher) is talking to the kids in his class in Russian, one of the kids asks a question in Ukrainian and he answers in Ukrainian, then continues in Russian, it’s seamless",

During this time, the peninsula has been viewed by much of the world as a “disputed territory” or even a potential bargaining chip in the peace process. However, with the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, it became clear that Crimea serves not only as a military base but also as a platform for committing war crimes, carrying out systematic repressions, and executing strategic manipulations.**\n\n# Crimea as a military launchpad for invasion\n\nSince the beginning of the occupation in 2014, Russia has turned Crimea into a strategic military base. Shortly after its illegal annexation, the peninsula became a key hub for the Russian Black Sea Fleet and a center of regional militarisation: military infrastructure expanded rapidly, with new missile systems, aviation units, air defense systems, and more deployed. According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of fall 2019, Russia had stationed 40 tanks, 583 armored vehicles, 162 heavy artillery systems, 122 combat aircraft, 62 helicopters, and 12 multiple rocket launch systems in Crimea. Additionally, 34 Russian warships and seven submarines were already operating in the region.\n\nIt was from occupied Crimea that Russia launched its offensive against southern Ukraine in the early days of the full-scale invasion. The peninsula was used as a launchpad, allowing the Kremlin to coordinate attacks on ground targets, firing missiles at civilian and military sites, and using both aviation and naval forces. After the initial assault has stalled, the peninsula continues to serve as a launch point for strikes on the surrounding Ukrainian regions: Bessarabia, Prychornomoria, Tavria, Pryazovia, Podniprovia and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nRussia uses Crimea actively for several reasons. First, its convenient rail and road connections allow quick delivery of troops, fuel, equipment, and ammunition, which are then moved to the front lines stretching nearby. Second, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, based in Sevastopol after Crimea’s 2014 occupation, uses the peninsula as both a staging area and a launching platform for missile strikes and maritime reconnaissance. Third, Crimea’s proximity to the front makes it a convenient base for launching drones and rockets. Since the distance from Crimea is shorter, missiles reach their targets faster, which also gives the Ukrainian forces less time to react.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvov5e560jff1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1664efe2b18d71ba0ed47c014ef753ea2bbd4cd\n\n# Deployment of Russia’s military equipment to Crimea\n\nDue to its convenient logistical location, Crimea has become a main route for transporting weapons, troops, and supplies to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nBefore military equipment is sent to the front, it often needs to be serviced or repaired. For this, Russia has built the necessary infrastructure in Crimea — repair bases, technical stations, and workshops. Old farms, factories, and industrial buildings have been widely repurposed into storage sites for ammunition, fuel, and other military supplies. In 2018, journalists from the Ukrainian media Crimea.Realities discovered abandoned cowsheds in the area. By 2019–2020, a large military facility had already been constructed there — a storage base intended for use in the event of a full-scale war. This is not an isolated example; Russia began constructing such bases long before the full-scale invasion.\n\nAdditionally, the peninsula has become a key center for conducting military exercises, with many military units and barracks built after 2014 to accommodate Russian troops and civilians from Crimea who have been forcibly conscripted into the Russian army. In 2015 alone, two out of six planned dormitories were completed for the 126th Separate Coastal Defense Brigade and the 8th Artillery Regiment of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to quarter up to 1,800 occupying troops. According to multiple reports, over 10,000 apartments were built between 2014 and 2021 across different parts of the peninsula to house Russian servicemen and their families. In 2023, the Russian government passed a law guaranteeing housing for soldiers fighting in the war against Ukraine. These servicemen were also granted simplified procedures for registering ownership of these homes.\n\n# How Russia violates international treaties on the militarisation of occupied territories\n\nThe militarisation of Crimea clearly shows Russia’s disregard for the safety and well-being of the local population. Many Crimean residents understand that their lives have become hostage to war — the peninsula has been turned into a massive military base, and people are effectively used as a resource to serve the needs of the occupying forces. Moreover, Russian forces deliberately integrate civilian infrastructure into their military strategy, constructing facilities near residential areas to reduce the likelihood of Ukrainian strikes. The coordinator of the Yellow Ribbon resistance movement reported that residents of Sevastopol — the administrative capital and the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet — have repeatedly complained about the construction of military sites close to their homes, significantly increasing the danger for civilians.\n\n***Note: \"Yellow Ribbon\" is a public resistance movement in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, created in April 2022 after the Russian military invasion. The goal of the movement is informational resistance to the Russian occupiers.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lazxkm7e0jff1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1ab98866501cc5b6b595b5f88c29d9533bdbb1\n\nRussia’s military presence on the peninsula also fuels the crackdowns on local activists, public society, and civilians loyal to Ukraine. Faced with the constant threat of forced mobilisation and repression, more than 200,000 residents have been forced to flee as of July 2024, as reported by the Permanent Representative of the President in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This decision requires careful planning, as Russian occupation forces strictly monitor and control departures from the peninsula.\n\n# Illegal mobilisation of Crimeans into the Russian army\n\nForced mobilisation of Crimean residents began immediately after the 2014 occupation of the peninsula, but the most active waves started following the full-scale invasion in 2022. Forcing civilians in occupied territories to serve in the occupying power’s military is a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. According to the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, up to 25,000 draft notices were issued, with 90% of them handed specifically to Crimean Tatars.\n\n***Note: The Mejlis is the sole supreme representative and executive body of the Crimean Tatar people. It was established in 1991.***\n\nMany Crimean residents initially refused to accept Russian citizenship. However, due to severe restrictions, such as denial of access to medical care, education, employment, pensions, and direct threats, they were forced to obtain it. Holding a Russian passport automatically makes every man eligible for military service and, consequently, for mobilisation. Procedural violations often accompany the draft. Military enlistment offices routinely reject medical certificates, while officials often ignore or destroy deferral and exemption documents on the spot. Occupation authorities also dismiss religious beliefs as valid grounds for exemption, despite their prior recognition under Ukrainian law.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ywb4wel0jff1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5f2ccdc86d41182e916643f495af9f61b3bc2b\n\nOpen sources also report repeated cases of men being detained in the streets directly after work by enlistment officers, often being taken immediately to enlistment offices. Detainees are not informed of their whereabouts or what will happen next; occupying forces instruct them to turn off their phones and deny any contact with their families. Under physical and psychological pressure, many are coerced into signing “voluntary” applications to join the Russian army.\n\nFormer Presidential Representative in Crimea Tamila Tasheva reported that in 2023, approximately 44,500 Crimean residents were conscripted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Others try to avoid the draft by not staying at their registered address, hoping to keep away from the visits of military offices or security agents.\n\nThose who ignore draft notices, avoid military offices, or skip medical check-ups face administrative fines that increase over time. Furthermore, police put such individuals on wanted lists. The occupying authorities track them using phone data, social media activity, and street surveillance. Men who try to leave the peninsula but fall under the mobilisation category are stopped at checkpoints and denied exit. Filing a legal complaint against such persecution is futile — most end up with penalties and forced enlistment anyway.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Join us tomorrow for Part 2, about human rights violations and the persecution of Crimean Tatars.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1251st day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦\n\n",

Not even the Germans and Japanese were this depraved by using POWs (or foreign civilians) as meat shields in their campaigns. The last time this tactic was widely used was during the МоngоІ campaigns 800 years ago. It should be no surprise then that the МоngоІѕ' most loyal ~~collaborators~~ *bootlickers* from Muscovy have emulated the tactic in the present-day, no matter how hard Russians keep insisting on their \"European\" and \"Christian\" credentials.\n\nThis is also linked to postwar Russians' deranged flex and gross attempt to fish for external sympathy by shedding counterfeit tears about their oh-so-sacred ancestors suffering more than 25 million casualties in WW II.\n\nThey deliberately cover up how the oh-so-precious and oh-so-peaceful ethnic Russians got off quite lightly [compared to the Ukrainians and Belarusians when looking at the depopulation of each ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#Soviet_Union). If you'd believe the Russians' insufferably sob story, you'd think that more than 25 million *Russians* died when the truth reveals how shamelessly and routinely the Russians have appropriated and stolen *anything* from **non**\\-Russians be it tangible like land, money or women, or intangible like culture, dignity or victimhood.",

The economic dislocation of the nineties, the cheerless noughties, and now President Vladimir Putin’s iron rule – with its fake elections, corrupt bureaucracy, monopolization of mass media, political trials and ban on protest – have inculcated a feeling of total helplessness. People do not vote in elections: ‘They’ll choose for us anyway;’ they don’t attend public demonstrations: ‘They’ll be dispersed anyway;’ they don’t fight for their rights: ‘We’re alive, and thank god for that.’*\n\n&gt;*A 140-million-strong population exists in a somnambulistic state, on the verge of losing the last trace of their survival instinct. They hate the authorities, but have a pathological fear of change. They feel injustice, but cannot tolerate activists. They hate bureaucracy, but submit to total state control over all spheres of life. They are afraid of the police, but support the expansion of police control.* ***They know they are constantly being deceived, but believe the lies fed to them on television.***",

He had been expelled from a technical university in 2023 for poor academic performance but stayed in Ukraine.\n\nThe SBU later detained his father, accused of planning to pass the documents to Chinese intelligence. Although based in China, he had visited Ukraine “to personally coordinate” his son’s activities.\n\nA Ukrainian official told Reuters these are believed to be the first arrests of Chinese spies since Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nUkraine’s domestically built Neptune missile first gained international attention by sinking the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva, and has since been used against other Russian targets.\n\nBoth suspects are charged under Part 1 of Article 114 of Ukraine’s Criminal Code (espionage) and face up to 15 years in prison and asset confiscation.",

    "selftext": "I found this useful for understanding my own biases, and I think it could be very useful when discussing the war with liberal minded folk like myself. I've run it through an AI translator that I think did an excellent job.\n\nOriginal: [https://trafo.hypotheses.org/52570](https://trafo.hypotheses.org/52570)\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nBy Olena Komar\n\n  \n\n\nIn this article, I demonstrate a series of biases against Ukrainians in Western countries, which I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome” (by analogy with the “North African syndrome”). These prejudices have emerged due to how Ukrainians speak about the war and how they are perceived in connection with Western European stereotypical expectations. Furthermore, these prejudices have a colonial nature, stemming from an inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians. This bias is reinforced by historical short-sightedness, influenced by pro-Russian sentiment in Slavic studies as well as by pseudo-pacifism.\n\n  \n\n\nPseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence but also to shift the blame onto the victims—denying them the right to self-determination and the capacity to make informed decisions about their fate. These prejudices are also a form of epistemic injustice, which must be confronted by rooting out ignorance. Such ignorance can be intentional, serving the interests of the oppressor by sustaining misunderstanding of the experience and suffering of the oppressed.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are several levels of epistemic injustice:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Stereotyping Ukrainians’ struggle for survival and identity as a manifestation of belligerence;\n2. Rejection of war as a negative phenomenon is projected onto war victims—their experiences and emotions become unwanted. This leads to silencing or victimization;\n3. Injustice of testimony and gaslighting result from “blind spots” in people’s knowledge: a distrust of Ukrainians’ accounts and understanding of their own history and of Russians;\n4. Unjust equalization, coercion into peace and compromises that benefit only the aggressor.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nNegativity or Resistance to Oppression?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nA Ukrainian athlete refused to shake hands with a Russian athlete, Ukrainian writers declined to participate in a joint panel discussion with a Russian writer, and Ukrainian scholars protested against the idea of delegates from Russian universities participating in a conference.\n\n  \n\n\nHow do Western Europeans react to such news? Do they view these actions as legitimate, just, reasonable? Most often, such events escalate into scandals, and the Ukrainians involved are accused of xenophobia, racism, or nationalism, cruelty, aggression, and discrimination, because Ukrainians distrust talk about peace negotiations, refuse to build “bridges of friendship” between intellectuals, and their statements are interpreted as hate speech.\n\n  \n\n\nIs there something wrong with the Ukrainians themselves and how they deliver their messages? Or is the problem on the side of the listeners, in how they perceive these messages and their trust in the speakers? I want to draw attention here to the latter.\n\n  \n\n\nThe stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied plays into the hands of Russian propaganda, which tries to portray Ukrainians as simply “bad Russians.” In my opinion, without a proper understanding of hermeneutical injustice, the harm caused is likely to grow—reinforcing the formation of what I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat Are the Preconditions for This Argument, and Where Does the Term Come From?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI use this term by analogy with the one used by Frantz Fanon, who introduced the “North African Syndrome” in his essay of the same name. This is not a medical diagnosis but a prejudice held by French psychiatrists toward North African inhabitants. Modern science recognizes this syndrome as a manifestation of racist colonial bias—under which North Africans were seen as lazy or overly emotional.\n\n  \n\n\nThis viewpoint did not necessarily stem from malice on the part of individual doctors, but rather from stereotypical perceptions of Africans as mentally inferior and emotionally unstable—perceptions shaped by colonial attitudes. This bias arose unconsciously as a result of institutional instruction—but does that absolve the doctors from responsibility for their own ignorance?\n\n  \n\n\nModern science considers such ignorance blameworthy and irresponsible because, first, it could have been avoided and corrected through proper epistemic conduct, and second, it harms others and therefore is not innocent.\n\n  \n\n\nMany studies have been devoted to decolonizing knowledge and to the concept of “white optics” or “white ignorance,” which allows one to “not see” numerous discriminatory manifestations.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd yet there is still no clear understanding of the place of white Slavic peoples in Europe, who for much of the last few centuries have been more oppressed than oppressors.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe Lack of a Hermeneutical Perspective Toward Ukrainians\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe absence of a hermeneutical perspective regarding Ukrainians as Eastern Europeans who, for most of their history, were enslaved, restricted in rights, oppressed, or engaged in struggles against attempts at genocidal extermination has extremely harmful consequences for understanding the present-day Ukrainian condition.\n\n  \n\n\nImposing a Western European optic onto Ukrainians leads to dramatic distortions because Ukrainians historically have been neither a privileged part of the Western world with its colonialism, nor do they identify with the “Russian world” and its imperial ambitions.\n\n  \n\n\nAnti-colonial and anti-racist criticism also often misses the mark, since Ukrainians are not “white privileged oppressors.” Therefore, accusations of racism for helping Ukrainian refugees—which are often inflamed by Russian propaganda abroad—are deliberately divisive messages.\n\n  \n\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainians have never been perceived by the West as a distinct oppressed community, because they were viewed only through the Russian colonial optic as “the edge of Russia” or as “Little Russians.” This was reinforced by both the Soviet myth of the equality of brotherly republics and the Russian myth of the “younger brother.” The current rhetoric of the Russian regime toward Ukrainians is even worse, consisting of the total denial of Ukrainian subjectivity—as “bad Russians” or even as a “virus.”\n\n  \n\n\nAs a result, Ukrainian identity is extremely blurred in the Western European focus, and in many aspects—including language—there is a blind spot. For example, refugee assistance centers abroad default to offering help from Russian-speaking interpreters. This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.\n\n  \n\n\nSince many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nBravery or Belligerence?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAt the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.\n\n  \n\n\nYet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nA Personal Anecdote\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n“My son, age 10, visibly tenses when I suggest adding a slide with a photo of the destroyed museum to his school presentation in Vienna about the Ukrainian artist Mariia Prymachenko. On February 25, 2022, the museum in the town of Ivankiv, which housed a collection of the artist’s paintings, was destroyed by the Russian army during their advance on Kyiv.\n\n  \n\n\nOf course, Austrian teachers and students will love Prymachenko’s fantastical animals, birds, and flowers—works admired by Pablo Picasso. They are colorful and joyful. But why should they see that the artist’s museum was destroyed by Russian soldiers? They might not even like that you mention “Russian”—there’s a Russian student in class, it might make him uncomfortable, and that could be labeled as ‘xenophobia.’”\n\n  \n\n\nEven a young child in primary school quickly learns that Ukrainians with “their war” do not fit the standards of pacifist countries—especially German-speaking ones.\n\n  \n\n\nAre our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nEuropean Pacifism and the Rejection of Ukrainian Pain\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe pacifism of modern Germans and Austrians—their rejection of nationalism and aggression in any form—has a clear historical basis: a desire to forget and cleanse themselves after World War II from the image of a nation burdened with collective guilt for Nazi crimes or, at the very least, for their failure to resist evil.\n\n  \n\n\nThose who, more than anyone, should understand what Ukrainians feel today—once again victims of aggression—prefer not to reopen wounds of memory, even if that means ignoring the destruction of Ukrainians.\n\n  \n\n\nBut there is a huge difference between renouncing the idea of attacking other countries and denying others their right to defend themselves by any means available when they are attacked.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n“Kriegmüde” – War-Weary\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n“Kriegmüde” (literally “tired of war”) is a new German word I learned from a letter from another school. Europeans are tired of the war, of high prices, of helping refugees, and they ask us: “When will there be peace? Why don’t Ukrainians compromise?”\n\n  \n\n\nBut can Ukrainians afford to be tired of the war? Do they keep talking about it because they want it to continue?\n\n  \n\n\nSi vis pacem, para bellum — “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Peace will come through justice, not through compromise if that compromise is rotten.\n\n  \n\n\nAccording to Professor Margalit, author of On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, those compromises that preserve a regime of cruelty and humiliation are morally unacceptable—even in the name of peace.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThis Isn’t the First Time the West Has Looked Away\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThis is not the first time in world history that Western Europeans have not wanted to know about the destruction of Ukrainians by Russians.\n\n  \n\n\nAt present, “peace” for Ukraine on Russian terms means slow, systematic extermination, as has happened in previous periods of history. In his 1983 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe, Czech writer Milan Kundera—himself exiled because of Soviet aggression—criticized Western Europeans for not valuing what other Europeans were ready to die for.\n\n  \n\n\nHe wrote:\n\n  \n\n\n“One of the great European peoples (almost forty million Ukrainians) is slowly disappearing. And this immense, nearly unbelievable event is taking place, and the world does not notice it.”\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAllies Stabbing in the Back\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nUkrainians are genuinely angered and frustrated by a number of topics related to false or misguided support from allies—especially when these same allies simultaneously express support for supposedly “good Russians” or try to build “bridges of friendship” with them.\n\n  \n\n\nSince the start of the full-scale war in 2022, many Western institutions—including universities and academies—have issued public statements that repeat the phrase:\n\n  \n\n\n“We support Ukrainians and brave Russians who oppose the war.”\n\n  \n\n\nBut this seemingly inclusive language is deeply flawed. First, it equates the aggressor and the victim. Second, it places the virtue label “brave” on Russians, while Ukrainians are merely pitied as victims. Third, it often borrows Ukrainian symbols to promote Russian Studies, which many Ukrainians perceive as an act of appropriation.\n\n  \n\n\nEven if well-intentioned, these gestures often backfire. Ukrainians feel betrayed, silenced, or spoken over. This is a form of gaslighting—and as scholar Rachel McKinnon explains, betrayal by an ally hurts especially deeply. It is compounded by “westsplaining” and “russsplaining”: imposing Western or Russian colonial views on Ukrainians, who are framed through Russian-dominated academic lenses.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nFalse Equivalence and Real Injustice\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nA disturbing example: the Finnish Migration Service housed Russian men avoiding mobilization in the same shelters as Ukrainian refugee women and children. This was traumatic and dangerous for the Ukrainian women—but it stemmed from an epistemic blind spot, a refusal to differentiate between the oppressed and the complicit.\n\n  \n\n\nThis kind of moral flattening continues in many forms:\n\n  \n\n\n* Demanding Ukrainian victims engage in panels with “brave Russians”\n* Framing the war as a “family conflict”\n* Calling for equal dialogue between an aggressor and their victim\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSuch gestures are not neutral. They entrench injustice. Real justice means amplifying Ukrainian voices, prioritizing the needs of the oppressed, and resisting narratives that “both-sides” the war.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat Real Parity Requires\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nEqual negotiations cannot occur until:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Full cessation of aggression and guarantees against future attacks\n2. Compensation for historical discrimination\n3. Transformation of social structures to eliminate injustice\n4. Affirmative support for the voices of the historically oppressed\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nOnly then can genuine parity be discussed. Otherwise, reconciliation efforts only entrench discrimination and deepen epistemic injustice.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe literature on decolonizing knowledge and epistemic injustice is relatively new. Yet Ukraine remains almost a tabula rasa in that discourse.\n\n  \n\n\nWestern Europe faces a historic choice:\n\nEither to finally discover the real Ukraine—\n\nor to unwittingly assist Russian propaganda in cultivating the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”\n\n",

        "body": "Just read this on FB:\n\n&gt;I no longer write posts in English about the latest shelling and destruction in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. I realized that what hurts and burns me at first horrified Europeans, but over time they got used to it. For me, these are the children of my friends sleeping on subway cars or in the bathroom. These are destroyed buildings on such familiar streets of my hometown. Cities where the tragedies of strangers are perceived as our own. Do you know what the scariest thing about tragedy is? Its routinization. Seven dead, five dead, ten wounded. Translated into English, it's just statistics. Sad statistics of Ukrainian life. Horror that is already perceived as the norm.\n\n&gt;The further I go, the less I believe they will understand us. No one will understand what it's like to stay up at night, covering children with your body. What it's like when it flies into your neighbors. How it blows out windows. How floors crumble. Life is falling apart like dust. They won't understand. Even such simple, obvious and terribly terrible things, not to mention more subtle matters.\n\n&gt;The other day, a new neighbor moved in next door to me. A young Russian woman. She was settled by the mayor's office of our town, under a social program, just like me. The only difference is that I ended up here because there is a war in my country. A war that her country unleashed. From which many people close to me died and are suffering. There is no war in her country (yet).\n\n&gt;I asked in the chat room of German volunteers who have been helping Ukrainian refugees all these years, and besides - refugees from everywhere, whether there are really refugees from Russia in our district, and even if so - is it normal to settle us next door, because it's not really okay with me. \n\n&gt;In response, I received a lot of interesting things, such as quotes from the textbook Leben in Deutschland - about tolerance, helping everyone who needs it, and that not all Russians are necessarily evil, and suddenly this is a good Russian and why shouldn't I check it out. And in general, for us refugees, to have conflicts - in the hostel for asylum seekers, Africans and Syrians are always fighting. What kind of people. \n\n&gt;And then I understood! “Whatsthedifference” (aka “kakayarazitsa”) - a universal phenomenon. And there is no point in explaining that Africans and Syrians are not in a state of military conflict, and that domestic quarrels have nothing to do with existential conflict. And in general, there is probably no point in explaining anything. That is why this post is in Ukrainian. Like the post quoted below. It is for my own people - those who will understand.\n\n&gt;\" Seven dead were found in the collapsed building. But that's not all. Andriy is standing in front of the house - under the concrete are his 11-year-old daughter Maria and his wife Svitlana. \n\n&gt;He smokes, drinks water, answers endless calls. And so it has been for more than seven hours. Someone hugs him, asks to talk for a minute. He refuses. \n\n&gt;He stands and crosses himself. \n\n&gt;Svitlana and Masha lived on the third floor. Now there is the most debris there and rescuers are removing layer by layer with their hands. \n\n&gt;The boys are running around - Masha's classmates. They are here with their parents, they lived in neighboring houses, which were also damaged. \n\n&gt;A Russian Iskander hit the house on Dorohozhychi after four in the morning. \n\n&gt;There was a resounding alarm, people were returning from shelters. Then the alarm went off again and in two minutes part of the house collapsed. \n\n&gt;Maria and Svitlana were found dead 12 hours after the explosion.",

It’s a lot of text in the article for discussion but here are some notes.\n\n\"inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians.\"\n\nA large part of the West (at least where I live) does see both as very similar, but there are also people who see them as a different and independent people (me and many other people). What are the arguments of those who don’t see them that way? History and the fact that many of them speak Russian daily outside of Ukraine here.\n\n\"Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence\"\n\nTotally agree with this, but there are many people who are tired of politicians and their policies in their countries regarding how they handle corruption and money, and this has an impact on this. However, I don’t think anyone blames ordinary Ukrainian civilians for anything.\n\n\"Such ignorance can be intentional\"\n\nThats a fact, a lot of people simply don't care about what happens in Ukraine because they are feeling safe and its not \"their\" war. They carry on with their lives, dealing with their problems.\n\n\"The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied\"\n\nI don't think this is true at all, maybe im wrong but i don't see Ukrainian people like that. Maybe quiet, close and cold at first but thats normal when they are in a new country where they don't speak the language, for example.\n\n\"they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions\"\n\nThis is normal nowadays, it does happen with everybody even inside our countries with our own people.\n\n\"Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation. \" \n\nThey are not forgotten or unwanted, but those people need to show them, right?\n\nI believe there is a lot of misinformation in some Western countries due to language barriers, simply not knowing people from Ukraine or simply not caring at all.",

All of the sanctions Russia is feeling now should have been on since Russia invaded Crimea.\n\nI think the reason it wasn’t was because we have an industrial complex that was dying after withdrawing from Afghanistan and Covid, etc…  a speedy resolution was less attractive than firing up industry to make shells, tanks and artillery just like China has been doing in preparation for invading Taiwan.  We also saw an opportunity to ween Germany off of Russian energy. Something that various administrations have worked on and wasn’t ready at the time of the Crimean invasion.\n\nI feel like the slow escalation was working at the detriment of both Ukraine and Russia people.  But Ukraine was finally getting access to long range weapons it needed to disrupt supply chains and push back.\n\nWith the current US administration, if Russia nuked Kyiv, I am less sure what the response would be.  Before, I assumed that would mean Russia would lose most of their nuclear capabilities overnight.  Now, I think there would be some kind of international meeting and resolution that would give most or all of Ukraine to Russia in the name of peace.\n\nHaving Russia think that they can diplomatically take over Ukraine keeps them from scorched earth decimation across the country.  \n\nEurope needs to step up and end this.  If you can’t make your own artillery fast enough, buy it from the US.  This is a win-win since a developed and democratic Ukraine will be a huge engine for mutual growth and prosperity of Europe.\n\nDo I actually think Russia will try to invade Europe?  No.  But the advantage Europe would have if they end up with a European Ukraine is completely worth the effort, imho.\n\nDon’t forget.  If Russia takes over Ukraine, those Ukrainian soldiers we helped train become Russian soldiers.  Even the threat of invasion of the former Soviet states by this expanded army will result in their immediate capture.\n\nMost Americans I know want an immediate surge in the support of Ukraine.  Giving just enough to support to maintain battle lines has been awful and expensive.  I think those that oppose this support, might see a united new Europe as a huge threat to USA in terms of trade.  I think they might have a point as well.",

June 2025 is shaping up to be a disastrous month for Russia and its war against Ukraine — not only due to unprecedented drone attacks on strategic bombers and surveillance aircraft or sabotage on the Kerch Bridge, which have angered and alarmed the Kremlin.\n\nAs *The Economist* reports, by the end of the first summer month, Russia is likely to surpass one million troops killed or wounded. “The data suggest Russia is performing poorly on the battlefield,” experts write in the report. In Kharkiv, for example, Russian forces have been advancing at an average pace of just 50 meters per day — slower than British and French troops in World War I, who moved about 80 meters daily. According to author Seth G. Jones of CSIS, Russia’s campaign in Ukraine is on track to become one of the slowest offensive operations in modern warfare.\n\nBut the most shocking statistic is the scale of Russian casualties.\n\n“Russia is likely to reach the milestone of one million casualties in summer 2025 — a staggering and horrifying figure,” states the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). According to the think tank, around 250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, and total casualties exceed 950,000.\n\nThis, the authors argue, reflects Putin’s blatant disregard for the lives of his troops. “Placed in historical context, Russia has suffered about five times more casualties in Ukraine than in all Russian and Soviet wars combined from the end of World War II until the full-scale invasion in 2022,” they add.\n\nCompared to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which lasted a decade, Russia’s losses in Ukraine are 15 times higher, and 10 times more than in the 13-year-long war in Chechnya. Increased Western support has only added to Russia’s burdens. According to the study, the most critical factors have been tactical missile systems (ATACMS), HIMARS rocket artillery, 155mm shells, air defense systems, and intelligence sharing. All of this has crippled Russia’s offensive — without the U.S. losing a single soldier.\n\nExperts argue that the issue isn’t whether the U.S. holds the cards, but that it hasn’t played them decisively enough — failing to apply real economic and military pressure. As the study concludes, “Without serious pain, Putin will continue to stall peace talks, prolong the fighting, and wait for the U.S. to back down.”\n\nPutin can afford these losses in part because many of the killed and wounded soldiers are from the Russian Far East or recruited from prisons — not, as the analysis notes, the sons of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites.\n\nFor Russia, the war in Ukraine is turning into a historic catastrophe — militarily, demographically, and geopolitically. The losses surpass those of all previous modern Russian conflicts and reveal a regime sinking deeper into isolation, unwilling to retreat even at the cost of massive human suffering.   \n  \nThe war is no longer about victory, but about the survival of a regimes, democracy and freedom.\n\nSource: www.csis.org",

Also according to zelensky russia are returning their own soldiers bodies to ukraine pretending theyre ukrainian fallen soldiers in military body swaps as another way to get rid of their soldiers.

The burden on society is largely seen as one of the things that caused the soviet unions authoritarian regime to collapse. Imagine now, when Russia has less than half the population the soviet union did, now there are 100's of thousands of mangled and wounded men coming from an unjustified war of genocidal conquest that will be a humiliating defeat. Russia is going to get weighed down to death. Roughly 30x the casualties with .5 the population so 60x the problem you had after the afghan war. And this is still going. Thats if Russia stopped now. Meanwhile in all of the territories east of the Ural mountains in that vast space you use to claim you are the largest country, you have around 6 million poor and mistreated minorities with scattered ethnic russian who were moved there during the soviet days. Right across the border hundreds of millions of chinese citizens who need the fresh water and resources. Russia is grinding itself down on a front that it never was at risk at. So fucked right now.",

Although he sang so much before, oh so much.\n\nWe also do not observe any great joy from the European partners. Well, there are a few responses from those who do not decide anything, such as Boris Johnson, but in general there is a deep strategic silence.\n\nIt would seem, why not be happy? You were all so afraid of Russian nuclear weapons - well, we have reduced the number of aircraft that can launch these nuclear weapons by about 41 pieces. Targeting you too btw.\n\nAnd judging by the unidentified explosions in the port of Severomosk, where Russian nuclear submarines are located, the time is not far when these clay legs of the nuclear Colossus will also buckle thanks to Ukrainian ingenuity.\n\nThe question is - why aren't you happy that Ukraine found a way to strike at the Russian nuclear greatness that you were so afraid of?\n\nToday, The New York Times published an article that explains everything.\n\nIt turns out that they are all in deep shock, because everything has collapsed. The military was the first to speak.\n\n\"Ukraine has taken the war to a new level.\"\n\n\"Operation \"Web\" showed that it is possible to destroy an aircraft worth over $100 million with the help of a $600 drone.\"\n\nAnd not only an aircraft, we understand. Anything.\n\n\"According to a representative of the defense ministry of a European NATO country, Ukraine's strikes will obviously force allies to reconsider the vulnerability of their military facilities.\"\n\nYeah, right.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have shown that they can cheaply and effectively create in a matter of months what Western countries have been unable to create for decades for huge money.\"\n\nOf course.\n\n“We are gradually beginning to realize the threat that drones pose to American military bases located in many countries and regions of the world.”\n\nWOW, really?\n\n“These bases are unlikely to have protection against short-range weapons, and the lesson of the Ukrainian attack is that a strike on large bases, where many aircraft are located, can be launched at any time.”\n\nYou don’t say.\n\n“Moreover, Donald Trump’s $175 billion Golden Dome project, which is supposed to protect the United States from all types of missiles, including with the help of spacecraft, may turn out to be a waste of money,” - General Ben Hodges, former commander of the US Army in Europe.\n\nWell, one hit of an FPV drone on your spacecraft - and that’s it.\n\nAnd you know what the trick is, guys?\nYou did all this yourself. \n\nIt was your decision - to first take away all weapons from Ukraine, not just nuclear, but all of them, and leave it naked and barefoot in the face of its asshole neighbor.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the Russian invasion, it was your decision to give Ukraine as little weapons as possible, while the Russians were pelting us with every possible missile, bomb, and artillery, when the ratio of shells on the battlefield was 1 to 10.\n\nYou saw all this, and still came up with some lies, twisted formulations about escalation, and whatever else you wanted - just to not give Ukraine enough weapons - so as not to anger the Russians.\n\nIt was your decision - not to give Ukraine long-range missiles. You and the whole world watched as bombed Ukrainian cities bled, almost every day - new tragedies, new collapsed buildings, torn people on the streets, flowers and teddy bears on children's swings.\n\nYou looked at all this and helped only with words of \"deep concern\".\n\nUkrainians asked you, begged you: give us long-range weapons - to destroy their air bases, from where bombers take off.\n\nUkrainians sent to you a special diplomatic mission: here is a list, here - damn it, look: they brought a map, on the map - these military bases, which we will shoot at with your missiles.\n\nWe will not shoot at anything else, fuck the Kremlin, we want Russia to stop killing our people.\n\nNo. They did not give it.\n\nThey also mocked us. They gave long-range missiles, but they did not give permission to shoot them at Russia.\n\nAfter the strike on Okhmatdyt, when the Internet was flooded with photos of bloodied sick children, and all social networks exploded with rage with one single message: finally let Ukraine strike back! - no, they did not allow it.\n\nThe White House spokesman, then Biden's, came out that day, July 8, and said: \"Nothing has changed in our policy towards Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd now you wonder why Ukraine began to develop drones.\n\nA lot of its own drones. It began to improve them and bring them to a new level. Not only to fight with them on the front lines, but also to get these drones to Russian air bases, from where the fucking bombers take off, killing Ukrainians. And where it could not get them in any other way.\n\nThe Ukrainians have the right to destroy these bases and these bombers. And they have no other choice - they are forced to do it in order to survive.\n\nIf the Ukrainians had an immeasurable number of YOUR long-range missiles, then it would not have needed to develop Operation \"Spiderweb\", because it would have been slapping those missiles at Russian air bases.\n\nBut you didn’t give us missiles, and you can see how it turned out.\n\n“The Russian military will also draw conclusions and try to repeat similar operations in Ukraine or later in NATO countries, and Western militaries should be prepared for this,” military commentators say for The New York Times.\n\nAnd an Israeli military expert calls June 1, the day the operation was carried out, the beginning of a new era.\n\nBecause what Ukraine did is so cheap that almost any terrorist organization could do it – and believe me, they have countless ideas about what objects to attack there, in the West – both in the USA and in Europe.\n\nAny person with an average technical education and a 3D printer can make drones from shit and sticks bought on Amazon and organize such a coordinated attack.\n\nAnd now, the expert complains, Israel, the United States, Europe - they all need to completely change their strategy for protecting both civilian and military facilities.\n\nAll their bulky installations and machinery, which cost millions, turn out to be worthless in front of cheap drones.\n\nHere you go. \nAs the NAFO puppers say, the dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubricated.\n\nUkraine has changed the world again.\n\n(c) Nadia Palyvoda",

Ryan McBeth wrote about almost this exact scenario in his recent book, detailing how vulnerable military assets are within the borders of a country. Both the UK and the US have experienced suspicious drone activity, either attacking infrastructure or (potentially/alleged) sabotaging commercial travel. Over the last few years Finland, Sweden and Norway have all experienced similar threats to installations.\n\nNone of this should be a surprise to anyone, and the fact our governments have been caught with their pants down should lead to a thorough spanking.\n\nI'm not claiming no one in our governments/military had the common-sense to see this coming, or that they lacked the required imagination to be able to predict it, but clearly there has been some kind of lack of foresight/action here. Someone dropped the ball, and whether that's in the imagination stage, the assessment stage, or the development stage, those involved should all be embarrassed.\n\nAnd I'm fully with you, OP. If our stupid governments had done what they should have done at the start, this would have been over within a few months, and it wouldn't have reached this point. Instead, they forgot the phrase \"Necessity is the mother of invention\" and they forgot our own history in which we made remarkable developments during WW2.\n\nOur nations allowed this to continue, and this is the result. Our arrogant leaders underestimated Ukrainian abilities over and over and over again. Our nations have been historically so high on our own romanticized notions of historical heroism, we believe we're better than everyone else and didn't think Ukraine had the same abilities.\n\n(To clarify, I'm speaking of those in power. I think most citizens of our nations fully respect Ukrainian ingenuity and ability.)\n\nWell, now we're stuck in a difficult place where Ukraine has had no choice but to unleash a Pandora's Box of possibilities.\n\nAnd now I find myself wondering what else Ukraine has up its sleeve that the rest of the world will be surprised by. Will our leaders finally work out that we should help to end this now with conventional means, or will they again all sit back and deliver piecemeal nonsense, only to be shocked once more when Ukraine releases another \"unboxing\" video?\n\nSadly, given how stupid so many of those in power are - and have been for a long time - I fully expect them to do nothing again, and for them to be blind sided when Ukraine delivers another means of attack to the world that our so-called \"experts\" didn't have the intellect or imagination to predict.",

        "body": "I agree with what you are saying OP, and you've said exactly what I have felt since the day this war started. Plenty of us were screaming that Putin's nuclear threats 100% needed to be treated as a bluff. The day the Kharkiv offensive took place was the day the west should have flooded Ukraine with weapons to push the russians out once and for good. Instead, after the awe was over, the fear of eSCaLaTioN crept back. Those of us who were screaming for more, Zelensky included, were told repeatedly that the drip feeding policy was 100% fine and by doing this we are \"keeping the conflict contained so we do not have to send out children to die one day in the future\".\n\nExcept...that entire drip feed policy has crept us closer than ever to a world-wide conflict. I 100% believe that had Biden and his team shown some actual muscle and provided the FULL support Ukraine needed, the Dems could have used that as a launching pad for Harris to win the presidency. What a wave of patriotism that would be; finally the bad red army has been defeated, shamed and never allowed to invade another country again. All for pennies on the dollar, *not a single American soldier's life lost*, all handed on a silver platter. But now, we are stuck with a POTUS that has shit all over literally every single ally the USA has built over the past century, and he's not done yet. A weakened NATO that looks more fragile than ever where it seems like a given that the US will NOT come to the aid if called upon. The stability and leadership the USA has provided to the Western world is cracking and one day, some country somewhere will start some shit that will drag us all in, mark my words. What's that, talks of taking over Greenland or even f'ing Canada? I can't imagine Harris doing something like that. If only she had won, right?\n\nUkraine being given what they asked for, when the asked for it, being allowed to use it how they see fit would have resulted in conventional war staying exactly that way; conventional. Instead, we now get to witness the birth of the drone era of war in which the 2 countries that are by far the most advanced in that kind of warfare, get to test it in true battlefield scenarios. This isn't US drones chasing cavemen in mountains where 20 operators sit in a room and peacefully sip coffee while they launch attacks at a wedding. This is the future of war, of terrorism, on display and once again we can thank the policy of eSCaLaTioN management for allowing this kind of progress to be made. \n\nWhat I have learned is that if a nuclear-armed country wants nuclear proliferation to be a thing, you'd better step the fuck up and help other countries who have abided by your policy (in this case, Ukraine) of disarming and help them when they need it. And it should be done in such a way that other countries watch what happens and think twice before waving their own nukes around and invading another. A quick swift victory against the russians would have sent a strong message to China to think twice about about attacking Taiwan, lest you feel the swift axe of the west. Instead...it's a ticking time bomb and once again with Trump in power, it's not certain that the USA will come to Taiwan's rescue.\n\nAfter living in the aftermath of this attack on russia's nuclear bomber fleet, we can now use the power of hindsight to see just how the dominos have fallen ever since escalation management has led us to this stage. The frustrating part is that this was all entirely preventable, predictable, and those in power simply kept kicking the can down the road. The desire to keep your children and their children out of conflict, is in fact turned upside down, and for many it seems closer than ever. Especially for those that live within the sphere of American imperialist ambitions, and a fractured NATO alliance, thanks to a president who is very clearly on the Orc's side. One who would likely not be power right now had his predecessor shown more courage in the face of threats and shown his people that his side was worthy of their vote by defeating their eternal enemy, all for pennies on the dollar.",

So even though it's tempting to play on our noses towards ruzzia, it is not our place to do so.

Hats off to AFU&amp;SBU on execution but the idea? How tf are we shocked, again?     \nSince this year we've even changed the law to enforce authorizing all drone flights. There's a new fine and everything.  Our flight agency has the tool to set our drone's ass down or to return to point of start at moment's notice. But I've noticed multiple times in last weeks  that people fly over restricted zones and they don't call it in in Drone Tower and... nothing. Maybe someone seeks  the fine, but that's just silly afterthought that ought to be nothing more than deterrent. The real response should be forcing a landing, and then if you can't do that - that's when you know you're dealing with imminent danger. \n\n  \nThis  is one of the ways Ukrainians are helping to keep us safe - we get to adjust to these innovations without actively fighting a war which among other things makes command more rigid.  \n\nPS.: as a lazy motherfucker myself, I've got to wonder: what do you think your post achieves?

It made us go \"never again\", getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it was at the time, and pursuing a strategy of military autonomy up to this day, as controversial as it also has been.\n\nThat being said, I don't like being lumped together with the US under the umbrella term of \"The West\", and drawing blanket statement about us from it. Especially now that it's so fractured, with Trump saying things like \"The EU was created to screw over the US\", wanting to seize Canada and Greenland, it seems the US caught the fascist disease, like Russia.\n\nAnd for all that this term of \"The West\" is worth, Ukraine is now part of it, isn't it? Or at least part of the EU bloc as a Candidate country, which is more important than many realise. Ukraine's genius hasn't been only in the battlefield, but also in the political sphere. The Zelensky government has positioned Ukraine, not as a lesser country begging for missiles and external help, but as a hero of Europe, a leader and defender. Seemingly with the complicity and support of many EU leaders. Pretty much everyone in Europe now knows the motto of \"Slava Ukraini! Heroim Slava!\" This is rooted in the true glory of Ukraine, but I don't think it spread this far just by accident. Some even say that Ukraine is now the new leader of the \"Free World\", and in heart I agree.\n\nAs cruel as it may be in this cruel world, a \"self-actualised\" Ukraine doesn't get to complain about \"the West\". You are part of the West now, you are now the \"France of the East\", you are a leader who has to play with the hand you have been dealt with, we Europeans are the imperfect hand you have been given, but at least it's not \"you have no cards\" as the other would say.\n\nWe Europeans believed we achieved forever peace and mothballed our military. We were caught with our pants down. On the plus side, now that we are rearming, we can invest heavily in drone warfare just like Ukraine, you can guide us in that, we can together create the EU army of the future.\n\nWe have failed to provide you with enough weapons, but in many cases it wasn't that we were sitting on big stockpiles refusing to give it away, we didn't have much really.\n\nBut at least we have a lot of money lol, we've invested a lot of money in keeping Ukraine up and working, and in your military, to develop your own weapons, our weapons for the future.\n\nAs far as the EU is concerned, we depend on you as much as you depend on us. We are not the West as opposed to Ukraine. We are in this together. Your victories are our victories. If they are causing \"deep shock\" for the world, good. We are Europe, Europa Universalis.

For all of Americas accomplishments they have never really been under real stress. They don't get really exposed to war or privation. They don't really suffer poverty(American poverty is wealth in the rest of the world). In general, their lives are to good to make them fight for anything with any real risk to their lives.\n\nAs to governments... it's.. complicated.   \nIn every metric it is better to help Ukraine for the western world.. but there is also a few with real fear of Ukraine too at the heights of power. Ukraine could easily become Russia 2.0 in these peoples minds. Even if the concept is absurd to a Ukrainian the fear of a powerful unified nation with a modern army and a different way of thinking skews things. Then there is also the might makes right crowd that stupidly agrees with the Russian way of doing things. \n\nTLDR until the war hits home for Americans.. they'll continue to just be \"situationally interested\" for the greater majority.",

They've demonstrated that no part of the world is safe from this new form of hybrid warfare and that will shake the core of the great powers. \nThe second and related reason is the idea of mutually assured destruction. It relies on the fact that nuclear armed nations have the capacity to annihilate each other if a nuclear war were to start. This extends not only to nations nuclear arsenals, but also their defence against the nuclear arsenal of another nation. If you can demonstrate that you can defend yourself against a nuclear attack from another nation or you can pre-emptively cripple your adversaries arsenal before they're able to launch a strike it paradoxically moves the entire world closer to that precipice. Ukraine directly attacking the delivery systems of Russia's nuclear arsenal shows that not only their but also every nuclear armed nations arsenal is now vulnerable to relatively cheap and widely available weapons that smaller nations and even some terrorist groups are fully capable of utilising against them.

I’m not taking away from Ukraine, I believe we’re simply supplying/assisting and training.\n\n2. I really don’t like Trump and i’m livid at how he treated Zelensky. But isn’t the timing strange? Ukraine was likely pressured as we all witnessed, to be quiet and to not pull off any further substantial attacks. Especially ones that would seek to humiliate Putin which Ukraine is so damn good at. Trump wanted to be in full control of anything that might threaten peace talks.\nHowever after Ukraine signed the minerals deal and did all that Trump said, it became clear to Trump that Russia was the only one not playing ball. Something we all knew but he didn’t because he’s an idiot. \n\nI think because of this, Trump has given Ukraine the go ahead to start biting back again to force Putin to the table seriously. The issue is that Putin doesn’t want to legitimize Zelensky. He has paraded him on Russian media as a terrorist and an illigitimate leader. He also sees Zelensky as below him with no real power and therefore not his equal. He wants to discuss these talks with Trump and only Trump. If Zelensky and Putin are to be in the same room it would be with Trump. Putin is evil and very cunning.\n\nThe timings of the attack right before the 2nd round of talks is telling though. Especially since Russia snubbed the first round. They got a taste of their own medicine. You want strength and cunning power? Ukraine can rise to the occassion.\n\nLastly, this is just an opinion based on my observations. I say that because it is highly possible Ukraine just said “F this, Trump is getting us nowhere and it’s making things worse”. I just know that Zelensky has countless times put his own percieved image on the line for the US and Europe etc to politically/diplomatically get things done by the book so we are all kept on the right side of history and not stooping to Russia’s level of degenerecy, showing once again that our system of life is far superior despite it’s failings.\n\nGod Bless the Ukrainian people. 🇺🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿",

As you say you are  part Russian I am sure that as a tourist you will either be very, very unwelcome and possibly at risk of violence from the population,  not allowed into the country at all, or at risk of arrest under suspicion of spying or being a saboteur. I cannot believe that you do not know what the civilian population of Ukraine has been subjected to over the last three years and more.  Every major city,  including Odesa, is under daily attack by drones, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, rocket artillery,  conventional artillery, and air-dropped munitions. Many thousands of Ukrainian civilians, including hundreds of children have been killed.  Thousands of children have been kidnapped and taken from their parents by Russia.Thousands of attacks have been made on innocent civilians- several hundred attacks and air raids have taken place during the last week alone, all over the country, including on the beautiful city of Odesa. To hear you say that you are vaguely aware that the Russian navy has occasionally shelled Odesa fills me with incredulity. You are living in tne UK for God's sake,, where there is totally uncensored media and access to the Internet, which allows you to research such information at the drop of a hat.  Have you been living in a cave on a remote mountain for the last few years? This isn't a minor squabble between two families living in the same street, you know?  Do you understand? This is the biggest war in Europe since 1945 and hundreds of thousands of people are dead as a result, and hundreds of thousands have been wounded,  crippled,  orphaned, made widows of and been made homeless and refugees. Hundreds of Ukrainian civilians and Ukrainian Prisoners of War have been tortured,  raped and executed by Russian soldiers and FSB agents.\nYou cannot possibly be serious about travelling to Ukraine as a Russian tourist.  If you are, then you are probably the stupidest man alive. In fact I am astounded that you have managed to qualify to study at University doing such a complex subject as engineering but maybe you are one of these people who are book smart but lack any common sense at all. You claim not to be political but it is time you properly educate yourself about what is going on in Ukraine, starting now and for God's sake, and for your own safety, stay out of Ukraine- possibly for ever more.",

Some ground was retaken directly south of Pokrovsk, and also within Toretsk. The battle for Toretsk has been a horrific meat grinder for the Russians, and the fact that the fight for the city continues, and they don't even seem to have much of an upper hand, is a bad sign for them. There were also reports this week that Russian forces tried a massive motorcycle attack against Ukrainian positions near Pokrovsk, which was completely destroyed by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed almost 100 motorcycles, 21 armored vehicles, and dozens of Russian soldiers. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7mp1rrypswe1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6815c4821a5a7737e21040352ea9c92a300310d1\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8vh9rh0qswe1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a0241559f71dec862201c2042fdddb97270b1b\n\n* No changes here. \n\n**Peace Deal Analysis:**\n\n* The terms of the deal set out by the US between Ukraine and Russia are as follows:\n   * Official recognition of Crimea as Russian.\n   * No NATO membership for Ukraine, though EU membership is accepted.\n   * Freezing the conflict along current front lines, with some minor territory transfers (Ukraine getting some territory in Kharkiv, and Russia getting some territory in Donetsk), importantly, this would be a de facto recognition, not an official (de jure) one.\n   * Sanctions lifted on Russia.\n   * Some kind of economic cooperation agreement between Russia and the US.\n   * A \"robust\" security guarantee for Ukraine, provided by European nations, though the exact terms of this are vague. \n   * Unimpeded passage on the Dnipro river for Ukrainian ships.\n   * Compensation and assistance for rebuilding Ukraine, though the terms of this are also vague.\n   * The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be considered to be on Ukrainian territory, but will be operated by the US, with power supplied to Ukraine and Russia.\n* Overall, this deal is reasonably close to what I was expecting. You can look at comments I made over a year ago about the eventual resolution of the war where I sketched out something very similar to this. It favors Russia more than Ukraine, but the inclusion of EU membership, no demilitarization of Ukraine, and real security guarantees are all significant elements that don't leave Ukraine out to dry too much. \n* A lot depends on what exactly the security guarantees are. European peacekeeping contingents and a continued flow of arms to Ukraine are crucial to preserve any peace. I've seen some reports that this deal precludes any European peacekeeping forces, but I haven't seen direct confirmation of that. If it does, then it should be totally rejected. \n* It's important to remember that the chief Russian goals of the invasion were to eliminate Ukrainian sovereignty and \"de-militarize\" the country. Any deal that leaves Ukraine with control over its own government and preserves the strength of the Ukrainian military, is, in a way, a colossal loss for Russia, even though it may not feel that way, since Ukraine would still have to cede territory to Russia in response to an illegal invasion. For these reasons I also think it's unlikely that Russia will accept the deal, since accepting it would mean a tacit acknowledgement that they failed in their explicitly stated goals for the war.  \n* I also think it's unlikely Ukraine will accept the deal, since they have written into their constitution that they can't cede any territory to Russia. \n* This is a great example of the problem of justice vs. peace, similar in some ways to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Ukraine wants justice, while the US wants peace. You can certainly make the case that peace without justice is wrong. But if you look at how that policy has worked out for the Palestinians, you get the sense that at some point, sacrificing your people for the sake of land is also wrong. There aren't any good options here unfortunately, and in some ways, this kind of deal represents one of the least bad options. To keep fighting the war for another couple of years, Ukraine will certainly have to further lower their age of conscription. They already have a huge demographic problem and comparatively very few young people, so having to send those 18- and 19-year-olds to the front line would really hurt the country's prospects going forward. I do think it would be worth it to sacrifice Donetsk and Luhansk to save those young people, though that is obviously an extraordinarily bitter pill to swallow. \n* The bottom line for me is, when you are fighting against someone much stronger than you, you have to accept that survival is the most important victory. This deal, if it did include peacekeeping forces, would allow Ukraine to survive. I'd love to be in a world where Ukraine is able to take back the territory they've lost. But unfortunately, we haven't seen any indication that they are capable of that. And waiting on the Russian military to collapse is not a winning bet. Ask Napoleon or Hitler how that worked out for them. \n\n**Events this Week:** \n\n* In a grim continuation of a recent trend, Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike against Ukraine, including attacks that explicitly targeted civilians, which is a war crime. At least 9 people were killed, and many more wounded. This attack did prompt Trump to angrily post on social media \"Vladimir, STOP!\" He has publicly expressed his frustration with Putin more than once, and a part of me still holds out for the day when he may finally realize that trying to work with Putin is a fool's errand. But he and JD Vance also posted more false and incredibly stupid criticisms of Zelensky and said that if the proposed deal isn't agreed to soon, the US will fully step away from the conflict. \n* A massive explosion occurred at Russia's 51st GRAU arsenal close to Moscow. It's unclear if the explosion was because of a Ukrainian attack, sabotage, or simply a mistake. But the damage and fires are clearly visible on satellite imagery, so this was a very powerful explosion. Some sources have claimed that over 100,000 tons of ammunition were destroyed.\n* Putin announced a farce Easter truce last weekend that was immediately violated hundreds of times by his own forces. \n* Reuters reported this week that small groups of officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army have arrived in Ukraine behind Russian lines to observe conditions and gather information. These officers are not fighting in the war but are there to signal Chinese support for Russia and help the Chinese military learn lessons from the war. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,470 (+145)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,938 (+21)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,874 (+58)\n* Russian SPG losses: 918 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 320 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 139 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,678 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,156 (+5)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,326 (+11)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 886 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 529 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+1)\n\nLighter losses on both sides this week, though Russia losses are still fairly bad. Ukrainian ones are mostly back to normal.\n\nThanks for reading! ",

    "selftext": "Peace is out of reach for Ukraine due to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing aggression, European defense ministers stressed Friday, even as the United States pushed ahead with talks with Moscow.\n\nTop Trump administration official Steve Witkoff met Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, shaking hands with Putin at the start.\n\nPutin and Witkoff were set to discuss Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the meeting, which ended at 10 p.m. Moscow time (3 p.m. ET), according to Russian state media TASS.\n\nPeskov had referred to the assembly as “a good opportunity” to convey the Russian position to Trump. A possible Putin-Trump meeting may also be on the agenda, state news agency RIA Novosti cited Peskov as saying.\n\n“The painstaking work continues. Naturally, Witkoff, as a special representative of (US President Donald) Trump, will convey something from his president to Putin. Putin will listen to it. The conversation will continue on various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement,” Peskov said, state media TASS reported.\n\nWitkoff, who is Trump’s foreign envoy, also met Friday with Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev in St. Petersburg, according to RIA Novosti. Dmitriev later described those discussions as “productive” in a post on X on Friday.\n\n# ‘Russia is the sole cause of this war’\n\nThe US meetings in Russia come as Ukraine’s key allies gathered Friday in Brussels, where the defense ministers of the United Kingdom and Germany emphasized that Putin has continued his aggression against both military and civilian targets despite claiming to want peace.\n\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting was co-hosted by the UK and Germany, with a noticeable absence at the table: US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who only attended virtually.\n\nThe group of roughly 50 nations, which was created by former US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the Biden administration, meets regularly to discuss bolstering military support for Ukraine.\n\n“Given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a news conference immediately after the meeting, speaking alongside the Ukrainian and British ministers.\n\n“We will ensure that Ukraine continues to benefit from our joint military support. Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it,” added Pistorius.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made a virtual appearance, where he warned the past month had made it “completely clear” that “Russia is the sole cause of this war.”\n\nHe made explicit reference to Putin’s refusal to accept a US-proposed ceasefire in March. “Without strength against Russia, there will be no will in Russia to accept and implement any realistic and effective proposals for peace,” he said.\n\nBritish Defense Secretary John Healey also noted that “today is one month to the day in which Russia rejected President Trump’s peace settlement.”\n\n“Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. Putin said he wanted peace, but he continues to drag his feet and delay negotiations. Putin said he wanted peace, but his forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike,” Healey said.\n\nFriday’s meeting marks the first time a senior Pentagon official has not attended in person since the group was established in 2022 just months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which comes amid a series of policy shifts by the Trump administration seen as moving closer to Moscow.\n\nIt came as Trump’s envoy to Ukraine suggested Kyiv would have to cede its eastern territories to achieve a peace deal with Moscow, in remarks that would likely alarm Western allies and leaders in Kyiv.\n\nGeneral Keith Kellogg, a former national security adviser, said Ukraine could be divided “almost like Berlin after World War Two,” in an interview with British newspaper The Times, published Friday. British and French troops could engage zones of control in western Ukraine as part of a “reassurance force,” with Russian troops occupying the east, he added. Kyiv’s forces would line the space in between, alongside a demilitarized zone, he said.\n\nIn a post on X, Kellogg later said that he had been referring to potential “zones of responsibility for an allied force” rather than the partitioning of Ukraine, and emphasized that the idea did not foresee US troops on the ground.\n\nWitkoff, another senior Trump aide, has touted the view that Ukraine would need to give up the four regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – to see an end to the war, indicating a stunning policy departure from the previous administration.\n\n# ‘A matter of priorities’\n\nGermany’s Pistorius said ahead of the Brussels meeting it was the Trump administration’s decision to attend virtually and was “not his business” to comment on the signal that sends.\n\n“It’s not a matter of priorities. I think it’s a matter of schedules,” Pistorius added.\n\nAhead of the meeting, the British defense minister offered strong words of support for Ukraine and called for putting “even more pressure on Putin.”\n\n“Our commitment is to put Ukraine in the strongest position to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and deter future Russian aggression,” Healey said in a statement.\n\nNew pledges of military aid announced after Friday’s meeting total more than €21 billion euros ($23.8 billion), Healey announced, calling it “a record boost in military funding for Ukraine.”\n\nGermany will provide a further €11 billion ($12.5 billion) in military support to Ukraine through 2029, including IRIS-T mobile air defense missile systems and PATRIOT missiles, Ukraine’s defense minister said Friday from Brussels.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Norway will also jointly give an additional $589 million in military aid, to provide maintenance to vehicles, radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones.\n\nAir defense is Kyiv’s priority, Zelensky said ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe absence of US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, pictured at Thurday's cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, will mark the first time since the group’s founding three years ago that a senior Pentagon official will not. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\n“We just need to address the shortage of air defense systems to make our sky protection stronger,” Zelensky said. “Our partners can help with this and also speed up the implementation of all agreements reached earlier. Patriots that remain unused in storage with our partners should be protecting lives.”\n\nZelensky said earlier this week that Russia was “preparing” a new offensive, as CNN reported that Russia’s army has increased operations across the front line in recent weeks.\n\nUkraine’s military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told Ukrainian media on Thursday that Russia has “already begun” its new offensive against the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.\n\nMeanwhile, a new United Nations report revealed this week that Ukraine experienced a significant increase in civilian casualties from Russian attacks in March.\n\nThe number of civilian casualties was 50% higher than the previous month, with at least 164 people killed and 910 injured in March, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Friday’s meeting was the first without a US defense secretary present. It is the first that a senior Pentagon official has not attended in person.\n\nCNN’s Mariya Knight, Matthew Chance, Svitlana Vlasova, Clare Sebastian, Catherine Nicholls and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.",

Basically his idea for consolidating and solidifying Putin’s power was to turn all any and discourse in the country into a show and an illusion. Nothing was supposed to be certain and nothing was supposed to be what it seemed. Even Russian opposition was always in the throes of paranoia which one of them had closer ties to the FSB. It is indeed a very complex and interesting policy that actually deserves its own deep analysis. \n\nAnyway the point I am trying to make is that this cock goblin Dmitriev can say whatever the hell he wants. It is all smoke and mirrors as is the current Russian tradition. The point is whether the companies are American or European they all have to undergo a certain procedure that involves notifying the government officials and the said officials have been lamenting recently that no application has been put forward.

There's finally a way to stream the Oscar nominated critically acclaimed Documentary *Porcelain War*. It's possible to start a 14-day trial at Docplay as soon as you're in Australia, New Zealand or the UK (e.g. for vacation, wink) It's possible to cancel the trial subscription right away, so it ends automatically after 14 days.\n\nIt's OV with English subtitles. It seems like it is exclusively published on Docplay.\n\nhttps://www.docplay.com/shows/porcelain-war\n\nFor anybody who's wondering, here's a short description: \n\nArt is resistance. Amidst the chaos and destruction of the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, three artists defiantly find inspiration and beauty as they defend their culture and their country. In a war waged by professional soldiers against ordinary civilians, Slava Leontyev, Anya Stasenko and Andrey Stefanov choose to stay behind, armed with their art, their cameras and, for the first time in their lives, their guns. Despite daily shelling, Anya finds resistance and purpose in her art, Andrey takes the dangerous journey to get his young family to safety abroad, and Slava becomes a weapons instructor for ordinary people who have become unlikely soldiers. As the war intensifies, Andrey picks up his camera to film their story, and on tiny porcelain figurines, Anya and Slava capture their idyllic past, uncertain present and hope for the future. Porcelain War embodies the passion and fight that only an artist can put back into the world.",

However, the Chancellery under Olaf Scholz blocked the plan.\n\nScholz was also in favor of the aid, but insisted that it could only be financed with an exception to the debt brake, unless cuts were to be made elsewhere. This exception comes now that, following the Bundestag, the Bundesrat also approved the constitutional amendments for the billion-dollar debt package agreed upon by the CDU/CSU, SPD, and the Greens.\n\nPlayer: audioThree billion extra for Ukraine: Why is it stalling?\n\n# \n\n# Air defense systems, drones and small arms in the pipeline\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Defense, additional weapons are now to be delivered to Ukraine this year. A spokesperson mentioned the Iris-T air defense system, guided missiles, surveillance radars, drones, combat vehicles, and small arms. He also stated that support for Ukraine must be considered for the coming years. According to government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit, German aid to Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion of the country has amounted to more than 44 billion euros.",

Which means that if, for example an artillery battery fired one shot, and drone filmed 5 people, and a shell landing right on them - it already means 5 casualties. No one counts how much were actually dead, how much pretend to be dead, how much got wounded, and how much got severe wounds. Keep that in mind. \n\nAlso, often times when soldiers get wounded - Ukrainian side registers russian casualties, but russians may possibly patch those soldiers up. And those same soldiers could potentially go back to the frontline and have another shot fired at them. And still make it back alive. But Ukrainians would obviously register that soldier as a casualty twice. \n\nSo don't rely too much on this statistics. Only relative to the losses dynamics. So for example today this number increases by around 1200+ eliminated personnel per day. Two years ago this number was around 600+ per day. We don't know for sure how much were eliminated in reality, but we know that based on dynamics the losses count increased significantly.",

Born into serfdom, he used his words to fight oppression, exposing imperial injustice and advocating for Ukraine’s national liberation. His poetry was so dangerous to the Russian Empire that they not only imprisoned him but banned him from writing altogether. Yet, neither exile nor censorship could silence his legacy. His Kobzar became Ukraine’s most-read book, spreading underground and shaping the national identity.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSince the full-scale invasion began, supporting our team and gathering donations has become more challenging as we, like everyone else in Ukraine, focus on fundraising for our defenders.

In the interview with NOS he dodged every question about him talking to Trump about the incident.\n\nhttps://nos.nl/collectie/13985/artikel/2557791-navo-baas-rutte-zelensky-moet-relatie-met-trump-herstellen\n\nTranslation:\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky must ensure that the relationship with the American president is restored quickly. That says NATO boss Rutte after the hard clash yesterday between Zelensky and Trump in the White House.\n\nRutte calls the confrontation in the Oval Office 'unfortunate': \"I don't think Trump was looking for a fight.\" According to Rutte, Zelensky and Trump first had a good conversation for half an hour. Then, according to Rutte, it was \"misforte wrong\", after which they fly \"full of each other in the hair\".\n\nThe NATO chief said he had contact with the Ukrainian president: “What I have told Zelensky is that we should respect what Trump has done so far.” Rutte says Zelensky must now find \"a way to restore the relationship with Trump\".\n\nRutte says he is convinced that Trump would also like a \"lasting peace\" in Ukraine. “What is needed is that we all work together: Europe, Ukraine and the United States.”\n“US remains committed to NATO”\n\nRutte also emphasized that the United States is the leader in NATO. The NATO chief said Thursday that he had called Trump for another half an hour and he is convinced that the US president is committed to the military alliance. According to Rutte, the US is \"totally\" committed to NATO, \"also as regards Article 5\". That article stipulates that an attack on one of the NATO countries is seen as an attack on all allies.\n\nRutte also underlined that in 2019 it was Trump who sent Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, which then helped Ukraine three years ago stop the Russians in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky and Trump came together yesterday to make a deal on Ukrainian raw materials, but that did not happen. During the meeting and in front of journalists, a quarrel between Zelensky and Trump and Vice President Vance came to a quarrel.\n\nZelensky called the incident afterwards in an interview with Fox News \"not good\", but refused to apologize. On X, he repeated today that he is \"very grateful\" for all American support. Trump said he was no longer interested in a commodity deal and says Zelensky has overplayed his hand. According to Trump, Zelensky is only welcome back to the White House \"when he is ready for peace\".\n\nTomorrow European Summit in London\n\nTomorrow, European leaders will meet in London led by British Prime Minister Starmer. Zelensky is also present. According to Rutte, it is important that the countries agree on security guarantees when it comes to an agreement with Russia.\n\n“We do not want war forever, but a lasting peace. In addition, it is important that Putin or his successor never dares to lift a finger in an agreement.\"",

While I don't think there is no choice, without USA Ukraine can't do anything else than heroically defend while being slowly pushed out. \n\nWhile production some smaller systems like MANPADS or ATGMs etc is ongoing and can be delivered to Ukraine, Europe has no stockpiles of the weapons that will let Ukrainians stop offensive and counterattack with successful breakthroughs - Tanks, IFVs, Breaching vehicles, ARVs. Without those they will be on constant defensive.\n\nEurope dropped the ball. There are only 2 NATO countries in Europe that make new tanks(hopefully soon K2 or Abrams will be produced in Poland): Turkey and Germany(with Greece, because hulls are made there). Italy has no manufacturing plant, UK built apartments in place where Challengers were built, France has no capability to build Leclercs. MGCS was a great chance to restart production, but Germany is sabotaging and delaying it, to not get a rival for Leopard. So France currently is without a capability to produce tanks and MGCS was delayed to 2040(and I already heard some voices about 2050). Not to mention that MGCS technical requirements are just absurd, much better protected tank with bigger canon but sub 50 ton. It's just not realistic. There is also upcoming KF51, but it doesn't exist in reality(it's turret technology demonstrator on hull of Leopard 2A4, to which Rheinmetall obviously doesn't have rights).\n\nPersonally I expected Europe to wake up and start with rearmament, but look at the orders for Leopards, everyone orders like 1 or 2(rare) battalions of tanks. It's a joke, same with the price of Leopard itself. Austrian gov approved procurement of 58 vehicles, with unit price of Leo 2A8 being 28 million euro. When you compare it to our(Poland) procurement it's unfunny joke. M1A2SEPv3 unit price is ~15.6m EUR and K2 unit price is ~18m EUR. Not to even talk about delivery time for Leopards vs K2s and M1s. I bet Leopard salesmen wear black nylon gloves and call it craft tank to justify the slow production and absurd price.\n\nThere is a reason why EU told USA that we can buy weapons for Ukraine from USA if they approve it, because there is nothing in EU stockpiles or production power to sustain Ukraine.",

History will surely look back at this day in disgust at the antics of the President and Vice President. I am ashamed and embarrassed to call myself an American today; well, for about the past month, really. You want to frame yourselves as the so-called leaders of the free world, yet you willingly eat up regurgitated Russian propaganda straight from the mouth of the authoritarian dictator Putin, and then try to spew it to your fellow Americans and the rest of the world.\n\n\nYou side with a fascist invader, the leader of an army of murderers, torturers, kidnappers, and rapists, over a sovereign democracy. One that we signed a pact with, one that we were supposed to back and support in the event that Russia broke the same pact and invaded Ukraine. It's obvious that you wanted to try to look strong and tough and bully Zelensky into groveling and signing away the rights to Ukraine's natural resources to the tune of $500+ billion in exchange for no security guarantees. Instead you looked like children throwing a temper tantrum, the epitome of weakness. Everyone with a higher than room temperature IQ can see through the facade, and that this was the game you intended to play from the start. Sadly your sycophants don't care because they want to get their grubby hands on a piece of the magat pie.\n\n\nI pray that the rest of the free world rallies behind Ukraine and shuns the weak, spineless cowards currently occupying the White House; leaders who refuse to stand up to oppression and tyranny and instead side with dictators, warmongers, and other scum. You're quickly destroying the reputation of The United States and eroding the trust that our long-term allies have previously had in us. Bravo.\n\n\nI sincerely hope that Mr. Trump has some sort of epiphany or receives some form of guidance and realizes that true strength and leadership means standing up to Putin and his ilk, because that is what America is, that's what we are supposed to represent. We stand up to fascists, dictators, and tyrants. We punish mass-murderers, not ally ourselves with them for the sake of money and power. And no matter how hard you may think it, you cannot control people like that, and they are not your friends. Putin is not your friend. Russia is not our friend. They have shown time and time again that they have no regard for anyone other than themselves, and they can't be trusted.\n\n\nGodspeed to us all in these troubling times.\n\n\nP.S. Funny quote at the top there about not forgetting the constitution, seeing as how Mr. Trump has repeatedly violated it just in a month. You can be better than that. You can represent the ideals of freedom, opportunity, democracy, strength in the face of adversity, unity amongst all peoples that live within these great United States. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she with silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\nSend these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”",

Feel free to copy\n\nMr. President and Members of Congress,\n\nI am writing to express the deep shame and anger I feel as an American in light of the recent actions taken by our president and vice president. The ambush of a foreign leader, an act of such profound disrespect and betrayal, is a clear violation of the values that our nation was supposedly built on. I can no longer stand idly by as I watch this administration tarnish our reputation and undermine the very principles that we are supposed to uphold.\n\nAs a nation, we are blessed with vast resources and wealth, and with that power comes the undeniable responsibility to help those who are struggling, both domestically and abroad. It is appalling to witness a government that so willingly ignores the needs of its own citizens and the suffering of others while prioritizing personal or political gain. The current state of affairs is unacceptable, and I can no longer condone the actions of those in power.\n\nThe GOP, a party that has long viewed Russia as an enemy, must find the courage to stand up to this administration and speak out against the destructive course we are being led down. It is time for them to grow a spine, show some integrity, and defend the principles of freedom, democracy, and international respect that we claim to represent.\n\nThis is a critical moment in history, and I sincerely hope that the American people, along with our elected officials, will find the strength to do what is right and restore the honor that has been tarnished by those currently in office.\n\nSincerely,\n\nXxxx",

President Zelenskyy is a tireless advocate for his people. He’s an honorable man who stepped up to inspire his country, and the world, under an invasion. Trump and Vance showed their asses today and Zelenskyy deserves better. Ukrainians share our values of freedom, the right of self-determination, upholding the rule of law, and democracy. Trump and Vance weaken our position on the world stage. They threaten our national security by working with authoritarian regimes like Russia. I have the utmost respect for President Zelenskyy and I will support Ukraine however I can. On the contrary, I hold zero respect for Trump and Vance. Trump is a twice impeached felon who clearly demonstrates signs of dementia. Vance is a know it all blowhard and a jackass with a god-complex. Elon Musk is a ketamine-addicted narcissist and a fraud, not a genius. As a country, we are fucked with them at the helm. \nAll of you are a disgrace. ”\n Also emailed my rep to thank him for speaking out about this trash behavior and requesting he support Ukraine in speech and legislatively. Just one of many.",

I’d very much want the U.S. to fully support Ukraine and no more slow walking.\n\n“Greetings Mr. President, I am writing to you with the concerns that transpired at the Oval Office today. I served in Ukraine teaching the Ukrainians English and enhancing their capabilities to meet NATO standards back in 2020-2021 during the end of your first term. I would very much like to reaffirm our commitments with Ukraine as they are a Christian and Democratic nation. We must support democracy. In addition, Ukrainians have vast military knowledge that will be vital in learning and adapting our tactical and strategic operations for future combat as drone swarms will be a path for the future. It is important to collaborate with the Ukrainians as they will improve our military and economic endeavors. Ukraine is sitting on lots of oil and natural gas that can be used for American companies to invest and help supply Europe and take away competition from Russia and/or gain leverage. I’d also recommend that VP JD Vance go to Ukraine unannounced if he feels Russia is not a threat. There would be no reason for VP Vance to be concerned for his life if he is in a residential area.  This is my recommendation for both of you to understand the dangers and threats that Ukrainians face daily. I appreciate your time and God Bless.”",

I saw a vice president act like a bully to a guest of another nation, and a frightened American president stammer and shout about his own self image. There was no deal making. There was no self control by the president and vice president. I did not see a strong America.\n\nI am also uncomfortable with the coziness the president has with Vladimir Putin of Russia, and I hope you share this unease. Comments such as, \"we go way back\" referring to his relationship with Putin should concern every American. A leader of the free world associating and normalizing in any way actions of a dictator like Putin, who has encumbered and persecuted his own people and terrorized independent and sovereign ex-Soviet nations, should be rightfully concerning to Americans if their own president permits or shares those same aspirations. The cruel and chaotic way the president has allowed Elon Musk to dismantle government and harass Federal workers affirms those concerns.\n\nI will give limited optimism that this is the President's negotiating style and 'give him room to work'. But he better start showing results soon. Right now I see a president who is way in over his head after making big bold statements about his abilities and is freaking out about being nakedly impotent for a complicated issue that is millions of lives and several nations bigger than him.\n\nPlease reassure me, as your constituent, that America is not faltering on our principles to defend freedom. If we must retreat and admit we no longer can sustain that fight, which I do not believe we are there yet, let us do it with dignity, not that shameful display in the Oval office yesterday.\n\nThank you,",

But, Zelensky was actively sabotaging any chance of negotiations by trying to force Trump to publicly acknowledge all of that.\n\nMarco Rubio summed it up quite nicely.  Aside from talking about needing an apology, which is just dumb.\n\nI'll remind everyone that the entire world has sat back and for the most part left Ukraine to fight alone.  Yes, some equipment and logistics have been provided, but what else?  It's great all the happy meetings are taking place, but I'm doubtful much will amount from it.  Europe has always had a much bigger stake in what happens in Ukraine.  Yet, they don't seem overly inclined to go beyond material support.\n\nThe cold truth is the USA has no obligation to Ukraine, but we've been sending help.  Everyone mocks the USA for overstepping and being \"The World Police\" until they actually need it.\n\nI get everyone is frustrated.  I'm also frustrated.  I was hoping the deal would just be signed and we could get working on diplomatically restoring Ukraine.  All of it.  Putin can be dealt with after.",

    "selftext": "**Disclaimer**: I wrote this text for a video, I might as well post it here.\n\nOn 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of February, people around the world are encouraged to gather in major cities to show support for Ukraine. I'm not telling anyone to go, but I am going to tell you why supporting Ukraine is important.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Russia invaded Ukraine because they saw that Ukraine is moving towards Western democracies and away from the Russian influence, but also the corruption inherited from the Soviet Union. This full-scale invasion was actually the second time Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, and the invasion ended, at least for the most of the world, with an agreement where Russia basically said that they are forever satisfied with the territory they captured, and they will never want any more of Ukranian lands. Probably because Russian speaking minorities were now protected.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine because when Poland and the Baltic States joined NATO, Russia was too weak to intervene. And yes, we joined NATO, because NATO is a defence alliance where you have to apply to join. In fact, in the early 2000s, Russia themselves wanted to join NATO, but since they weren't given an invite, Putin went home and started to form the propaganda claim that NATO promised him to not expand east. Actually, Russia has always had a border with NATO, but no one even thinks about it, because Russia has never really developed its eastern part.\n\nBut that is the main claim of Russian propaganda, that NATO and the evil west started the war. And now, the United States has taken Russia's side. At least the government, although there are politicians from Republican Party who express support for Ukraine and even counter Trump's recent claims. Trump would probably insult them, but what else can you expect from a president whose claim to victory is that within few weeks in the office, he defeated the Gulf of Mexico?\n\nSome people see the current peace talks of Trump as the new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union with a secret protocol to divide Europe into spheres of influence. This time, the Nazis are from the US government, and you can easily imagine it, seeing as Trump openly says that he wants to annex Canada and, basically, Denmark.\n\nWe should also highlight that a lot of propaganda is spread by the unofficial vice president Elon Musk, who was masterfully convinced to buy Twitter. Even simple things, such as carefully selected street videos that coincidentally only portray two specific Russian cities, convince young and youthful-spirited people that Russia brings peace and love. And then there are massive projections how Ukrainian generals buy fancy cars and real estate, which is, of course, what Russia is doing.\n\nBut, the further away Russia and Ukraine are from a person, the easier it is to make the person see Ukraine as this faraway place that does not affect them. This is likely why so many Americans cheered on Trump's claims. They may have genuinely believed that no one else can possibly know both Putin and Zelenskyy. Trump has repeatedly said that if he had been the president, the war would have never happened. Considering his recent claims, he would have likely avoided the war by ordering Ukraine to surrender.\n\nIt is ironic that the nation that is famous for its \"freedom isn't free\" attitude has so many people willing to let other people have their freedoms taken away. And yes, it is not only the United States, there are pro-Russia people even in Ukraine. But United States hurts in a special way, because United States has always hailed themselves as the beacon of democracy.\n\nAlso, Trump is now calling Zelenskyy a dictator for not holding elections during war time, but Putin being in power for 26 years does not bother him at all. Technically, he was prime minister for a brief period, but we all knew who held the real power. Probably even Trump, who, at the time, may not have even been thinking about running for president.",

If I am missing something please point it out but I have been researching quite a bit and not seeing where the US agreed to outright protect from ANY invasion. \n\n  \nLike I said, I am not siding with Russia. I just don't understand why everyone is talking like the US is responsible for protecting Ukrain. The agreement was for them to get rid of nukes and if they get attacked by nukes in the future than the US would help.  \n\n  \nNot trying to argue, just trying to understand responsibilities based off of the agreement",

They had dreams, hopes, and a future that was shaped by their upbringing, just like children everywhere. However, the reality of war robs them of their innocence and forces them into situations no child should ever face.\n\nIt's also worth noting that NATO, for all its claims of protection and peace, often ignores the welfare of children caught in the crossfire of conflicts. The focus on military strategies and geopolitical goals tends to overshadow the lives of the innocent, especially children, who suffer the most in these situations. We must ask ourselves whether the true protection of children is truly a priority in these larger political battles.",

There was never a blanket protection agreement made unless I'm missing something. Like I said in my last comment, the agreement was to send help if they were attacked by a nuclear weapon which has not happened. \n\nI've seen so many people say that by not sending more money/help that trust is being broken but I don't understand why the US is EXPECTED to send help just because they were invaded and if they are ever invaded again in the future. Is there an agreement that I don't know of saying that in the event of ANY invasion, the US will step in and assist?

It started with a Facebook post summoning protesters to the Independence Monument on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) on November 21, 2013. It ended when disgraced, corrupt pro-russian president Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine for russia in the wee hours of February 22, 2014, and Verkhovna Rada officially removed him from the presidency.\n\n# Sayonara, sucker\n\n\n\n[Maidanivtsi guarding Mezhyhirya](https://preview.redd.it/890tu9w3ckke1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9de5a8d0b3d42355372ec4f1f35a556364c13ba)\n\nThe Mezhyhirya estate started life as a monastery. It served as a state residence in Soviet times and early in Ukraine's independence. It was privatized, probably illegally, in 2007, while Viktor Yanukovych lived there. When Euromaidan scared him into the arms of his russian master, he and his entire security team abandaned Mezhyhirya, and the Maidanivtsi moved in.\n\nYanukovych had been relatively secretive about his private life. Little was known about Mezhyhirya with him in residence. The Maidanivtsi found themselves in a sickeningly opulent monument to corruption: in addition to the expensively furnished main house, they discovered a bar and reception facility on a replica Spanish galleon moored on one of the property's manmade lakes, a golf course, a museum for Yanukovych's collection of classic cars, and a private zoo ... all on an official salary of about USD $100,000 per year.\n\nThe Maidanivtsi opened the estate up to the public, giving Ukrainians a close look and just how hard Yanukovych abused their state funds.\n\nAfter Euromaidan, Mezhyhirya became an unofficial Museum of Corruption. Early in the full-scale war, it served as a shelter for people displaced from surrounding towns. On January 28, 2025, the car museum was struck by a russian drone. While I wouldn't normally cheer a russian drone strike, there is something amusing in it wrecking that russian puppet's precious car collection.\n\nThey never did find a gold toilet, by the way.

He signed an agreement to return to the 2004 constitution, stripping the presidency of much of its power, and to hold early elections in December 2014, three months earlier than the next presidential election would normally have been held.\n\nBattered and bloodied but not broken, the Maidanivtsi, were--not to put too fine a point on it--royally pissed off. They'd spent deepest Ukrainian winter living in tents on Maidan. They'd held out against Yanukovych's murderous government forces. And now they were being told that Yanukovych was going to be allowed to remain in power for another eight months.\n\nOne man brought their fury to the Maidan stage and gave it voice: 26-year-old Volodymyr Parasyuk from a village in Lviv Oblast called--really--Maidan. He was a member of one of the self-defense units (sotnias) protecting Kyiv's Maidan from Yanukovych's thugs.\n\nIn a short, impromptu, impassioned speech, Parasyuk sketched the reasons they were out there in the first place, what they'd lost, and their absolute refusal to accept the terms of this agreement.\n\n[I highly recommend that you watch it.](https://youtu.be/Ude6JX3YxVI?si=To5Y3C-YrJxWGYCp)\n\nThere was no such statement.

In 2013, Ukraine began to awaken and build its muscles, finally recognizing the need to assert its agency. It would be naive to assume that building this agency would be painless, and expecting someone else to pave the way to this goal would be an even greater mistake.  \n  \nFor eleven years, we have relied on half-measures to fight a war against a country with an advantage in population and resources. Moreover, for three years, Ukraine has endured a full-scale invasion by one of the world’s most combat-effective military forces. The daily feats of Ukrainian soldiers should inspire us and prevent us from despairing despite any statements made by foreign politicians, analysts, and experts. The frontline should always have the last word.  \n  \nOf course, we have not succeeded in every area, and much work remains ahead. Indeed, we put our trust in empty promises and gave away our nuclear weapons, critically weakening the country’s defensive capabilities. However, Ukraine has already achieved the impossible. Ukraine’s resistance to Russian occupation, the courage and strength of its military, our strong horizontal public relations, and our diplomats’ skills have already secured a place in history for our country. This is where the real Ukrainian agency comes from. And this is what vexes those who perceive a strong and independent Ukraine as a thorn in their side.  \n  \nNothing in today’s information environment should divert us from the path we have chosen. The same goes for those who eagerly began preparing for political games and illusory elections — under no circumstances should Ukrainians pay attention to them. All focus and strength must go to the frontline.  \n  \nDesperation arises when circumstances force people to stop fighting for their cause. But that is not about us. We hold our lines, and we destroy the occupiers!  ",

Yanukovych's government had positioned snipers along the route. They picked off protesters, and then government goons broke through the barricades and attacked Maidan.\n\nThey burned the tents. They fired on the protesters--not just with rubber bullets, but with live rounds, which were illegal except under martial law, which had not been declared. They fired stun grenades and tear gas. The Maidanivtsi fought back with whatever they had: some guns, but mostly more homegrown solutions like cobblestones, fireworks, and Molotov cocktails.\n\nThe fighting raged for three days. The Maidanivtsi bled. Dozens died. They did not fold.",

The dictatorial new laws did nothing to diminish the presence on Maidan. The laws were ignored and widely mocked.

Massive clashes erupted between the Maidanivtsi and the government forces, culminating in the Hrushevskoho Street riots and the first murders of protesters on Maidan.\n\nVerkhovna Rada cancelled nine of the laws on January 28, 2014, but the damage was done.

He chose instead to tie Ukraine inextricably to russia with the russian-Ukrainian action plan, which would have indebted Ukraine to russia and kept it firmly in russia's sphere.\n\nUkrainians, who'd been eagerly anticipating this turn away from russia and toward the EU, were outraged.

He visited Moscow in 1987 and was buttered up by the KGB over Trump tower Moscow prospects. When he returned to the US, [Trump took out a full page ad in the newspapers that questioned US membership in NATO and asked why those nations couldn't pay to defend themselves.](https://apnews.com/article/05133dbe63ace98766527ec7d16ede08) To be clear, this was 38 years ago, longer than I've been alive. And Trump's positions on these items essentially haven't changed since. \n\nAnd now, face to face with Putin, Trump always defers to him and adopts the Russian position. I guarantee you that Trump not only understands what Putin is doing (see Trump's similar language vis a vis Canada and Greenland), but firmly believes that if he helps Putin, Putin will reward him with property in Moscow.\n\nTrump is compromised, at best a useful idiot and at worst a knowing agent of Putin and the Russian federation, neither of which he has seriously criticised. Trump *wants* Ukraine to lose and *wants* to sabotage NATO as a quid pro quo for Russian favour and property deals, the better to personally enrich himself.",

The Donbas advances are the only thing you could really point at and call a success, for Russia, in the last two years. It has cost them a fortune in manpower and equipment for incremental gains.",

The full lifting of the siege was in January 1944. The lifting of the full blockade was a full year prior to that, in January 1943. Operation Iskra (spark) established a corridor into Leningrad, and prevented the link-up of German and Finnish forces, and strategically eliminated the possibility of any capture of the city. This was happening AFTER Operation Uranus in the south that resulted in the encirclement of the Axis forces by Stalingrad, so if any forces were pulled, it was South, not West. There's absolutely no historical basis for the claim that Normandy, or Sicily for that matter, had any impact on the Siege of Leningrad. At all.",

He began by fortifying the Atlantic Wall in Normandy with more machine gun bunkers, millions of beachfront landmines, and by flooding inland marshes to trap Allied paratroopers. Rommel’s strategic preparations would ultimately help the Nazis inflict terrible Allied casualties on D-Day.\n\nI think that's earlier than 6-months.",

For awhile there was a lack of defense lines and fortifications in the Sumy region.  The defense lines in the Sumy region were significantly upgraded only in 2024.  A large Russian force was slowly building up in the Kursk region and if nothing was done was likely to launch an attack before the upgrade was completed. The incursion bought time and in addition turned Russian defense lines into Ukrainian defense lines.  In addition to that, the town of Sudzha now acts as an important bulwark.  Overall it was a brilliant strategy.\n\nQuote from the following article available from the following link:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1h5kufz/comment/m06w2vk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1h5kufz/comment/m06w2vk/)\n\nQuote: \\[In 2024, the state allocated a large resource to the Sumy region to create fortifications that would significantly increase the region's defense capabilities.

        "body": "Nineteen-year-old Danylo Todorov was born and raised in Ivano-Frankivsk in a military family—his father is an ATO veteran, and his mother worked at one of the region’s military units. When the full-scale war began, Danylo was 16 years old and studying in the 11th grade. Upon completing his studies in early summer 2024, he signed a five-year contract with the 10th Mountain Assault Brigade.\n\nDanylo admits that his parents found it difficult to accept the news of him becoming a soldier. \n\n\"When I was studying at the military college, they were fine with it. But when I actually joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine, they started worrying a lot. Still, they supported me then and continue to support me now,\" says the soldier.\n\n**Overcoming Hazing Fears and Learning to Fly Drones**\n\nInitially, Danylo was assigned to engine repair and maintenance. However, seeing his potential, his commanders transferred him to drone operations training.\n\n\"When I first joined my platoon, where older and more experienced fighters served, I was afraid there might be hazing. But there was none of that. On the contrary, the experienced guys gave me tips, helped me, supported me, never humiliated or pressured me. In our unit, we live by an unwritten musketeer rule: ‘One for all, and all for one.’ The brotherhood keeps us motivated to improve our skills so we can take down more enemies together.\"\n\nInitially, he carried out reconnaissance flights, and soon after, combat missions. Within six months, Danylo progressed from a beginner to an expert drone pilot, largely thanks to the supportive and motivated atmosphere of his unit.\n\nHis drone, operating at night, is equipped with a thermal camera to detect enemy movement, even when they try to stay hidden. However, not everything that \"glows\" on the thermal camera is an enemy—sometimes, it’s an animal. That’s why a drone operator needs sharp eyesight, attentiveness, and keen observational skills.\n\n\"It’s important to have quick thinking—the ability to make the right decisions fast in difficult situations. And you have to be stress-resistant. For me, music and something sweet help me unwind,\" Danylo adds with a smile.\n\n**He notes that fear and anxiety are a normal part of war.**\n\n\"Fear is common in war. But you have to control it. The hardest thing for me was getting used to the constant shelling by enemy artillery. But over time, I adapted. The key is never to lose vigilance.\"\n\nOn January 14, 2025, Russian forces launched five massive assaults on the positions of the 10th Brigade. Danylo was among those who helped repel the attacks.\n\n\"We did everything we could. But honestly, our infantry did an outstanding job. \n\nOver 50 Russian soldiers were neutralized, more than ten were wounded, and one was captured. Additionally, the enemy suffered significant material losses, including two BMPs, 39 motorcycles, two ATVs, and 16 FPV drones.\n\n**Danylo’s view of the enemy is clear-cut:**\n\n\"These are people who want to take my land, my home, and my freedom. They bring death to my fellow Ukrainians and destruction to my country. If I don’t take him out, he’ll take me out,\" he says.\n\n[https://versii.if.ua/novunu/stav-veteranom-vijny-v-19-rokiv-yak-edelvejs-danylo-todorov-pikantno-likvidovuye-okupantiv-foto/](https://versii.if.ua/novunu/stav-veteranom-vijny-v-19-rokiv-yak-edelvejs-danylo-todorov-pikantno-likvidovuye-okupantiv-foto/)",

    "selftext": "Hello r/Ukraine! I've been studying this conflict since 2014 and have been writing these updates for the past year and a half. Recently I've had to find a new home for these updates on Reddit, and this seemed like the best place to go. The mods here have given me their blessing, so I will be posting here every week from now on until the war ends. \n\n**Video of the Week**:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ik8vzu/video/khad6v9hrjhe1/player\n\n* This video depicts a Russian MBT (a heavily modified T-72 variant) as it is attacked and destroyed by Ukrainian FPV drones. The crew and dismounts appear to all have survived.\n\n**Why is US Military Aid to Ukraine Important?**\n\n* Establishing the precedent that nations can take territory by force once more is dangerous for the whole world, particularly when it comes to China and Taiwan.\n* Russia specifically poses a credible threat to the NATO alliance, especially if NATO is perceived as weak and not unified. Part of the point of the war is Russia testing the United States to see how far it will go to defend European countries.\n* The aid we've provided so far is a tiny percentage of our total military budget. Much of what we've given is obsolete equipment by our standards that would cost money for us to hold on to or destroy.\n* The war has shown how much more effective our military equipment is than Russia's creating demand for our equipment all around the world, benefiting the US economy and our global standing. Much of the aid money dedicated to new production has also been spent in the US, further stimulating our economy.\n* Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in return for security guarantees, and if we fail to live up to that commitment, it makes other countries far more likely to pursue nuclear weapons, dealing a huge blow to anti-nuclear proliferation efforts.\n* A stronger Ukraine can negotiate a more favorable peace deal with Russia that ensures a lasting peace, and not a period of re-armament and re-invasion.\n\n**Maps (all images pulled from the Institute of the Study of War):**\n\nKursk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbqlrd7lrjhe1.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e2092d5817fa25aaf90c1dcd79dab479e9ff404\n\nKursk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f4cjp1orjhe1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83baf85f9786d492997d038a4b233b4f92d4f450\n\n* No changes here, though I saw today that Ukraine has done another limited attack in this area that seems to have been successful. Russia as far as I can tell has given up hope of reclaiming this region even though Putin declared it a top priority months ago. And now that the North Koreans have been pulled off they line, they just don't have much offensive capability left here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4ddj64srjhe1.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4360a60d3c6914e02b25a97aa9fbf79240bbb80f\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eryrb862sjhe1.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e9508db9ce7d1882d5ba73ffbe618459e4b7287\n\n* Russia has slightly expanded the salient southwest of Dvorichna.\n\nKreminna last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t3fhrg3sjhe1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aac15e276e8dc1f9d1708171b1f0eb34765433e\n\nKreminna this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7ob70o4sjhe1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8a0d2d0856820c6601181d618b3ee322540204b\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fq4iet5sjhe1.png?width=881&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ef70b56635288f4c9790f6edefe19a4177fcc64\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4c4j1hy6sjhe1.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a71b6dece19350d2d6b55b7993f37c8d384ff94\n\n* Russia advanced significantly within Chasiv Yar and also took a chunk of territory to its south.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ypthd99sjhe1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4adb145ef49c66a51bc55569f253d012d34c4c8\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3toi7qasjhe1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b40b474c350d2f2a21cf8e522b858e5ab6a6ed\n\n* Russian forces are still on the move here though they are slowing down. Still no fighting within Pokrovsk, though it seems it's only a matter of time before there is. I am very doubtful that they will be able to complete an encirclement of the town, however. And Pokrovsk still has two good open supply roads.\n\nVelyka Novosilka last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flv0gyrdsjhe1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52871e0ffd2a3f3210728c0244ed7d76d1d38b45\n\nVelyka Novosilka this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zvf089fsjhe1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=499b2f40efce24a53959c8ac0b9c620c1798c4c5\n\n* Russia has consolidated their gains around Velyka Novosilka, though I've read that the geography north of the town is much more defensible than the town itself. There were also reports that many Russian soldiers were killed there after being caught in a \"fire trap\" by Ukrainian drones and artillery.\n\n**Events This Week:**\n\n* Months ago, Zelensky floated an idea to sell Ukrainian mineral and rare earth reserves to the US in exchange for military aid. That idea seems to have had an intended audience of one, Donald Trump, and he has now expressed explicit interest in pursuing this deal, or at least using it as a cover to continue military assistance for Ukraine, which as far as I can tell is still ongoing. Zelensky continues to prove himself as the Trump whisperer, which in retrospect is not surprising considering they both have an entertainment background, and Zelensky is a keen observer of what works and what doesn't when it comes to pressuring Western leaders.\n* Bloomberg reports that the Trump team, led by retired general and Ukraine supporter Keith Kellog, is finalizing a peace plan to begin negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to stop the war. Key elements of the plan including freezing the front line, withdrawing Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory (without ceding that territory back to Ukraine) and giving Ukraine security guarantees. The most important element of this plan has to be the security guarantees, if they are weak or easily abandoned, then it is a terrible plan, if they are strong and will protect Ukraine from another invasion, then as far as I'm concerned, it's about as good as we're going to get. Ukraine is going to have to come to terms with the fact that they will have to let go of some of their territory, but at this point, there aren't any alternatives, and ending the war and stopping the intense bloodshed is an admirable goal that should be pursued with great vigor. I'm still skeptical that Putin will come to the table in good faith, but I do think that if these negotiations fail, Trump is likely to step up support for Ukraine, so Putin does have good reason to actually try and make something work. And any deal that preserves the strength of the Ukrainian military and provides them strong security guarantees will mean that the war was on the whole a massive failure for Russia, because their primary goals are to demilitarize Ukraine and bring it back into Russia's orbit.\n* Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was ready to negotiate with Zelensky, and also said that contacts between Russia and the US have been ongoing and serious.\n* The Ukrainian Parliament ratified a 2 billion Euro loan agreement with the UK. They will use this money to buy air defense systems, missiles for those systems, and repair bases for military equipment.\n* Reuters published an article this week describing how aid for Ukraine was consistently slowed down in the past year by Biden administration officials who couldn't make up their minds about what levels of aid would be too escalatory. It's a capstone on the Biden admin's immense failure to fully follow through on their public support for Ukraine, because they were handicapping them in secret the whole time so that they wouldn't piss off Russia too much.\n* Ukraine is now using FPV interceptor drones which are launched from drone motherships to down Russian intel drones. This is a remarkable evolution of cheap air defense technology that has significantly hampered Russia's ability to find and destroy Ukrainian targets effectively.\n* Ukraine's strike campaign against Russia oil continues, with several more targets being hit this week. One report claims that if the current rate of attacks continue, Russian gasoline production will halve by July, which would put a significant amount of pressure on the Russian government and economy.\n* Zelensky's main opposition candidate, former president Petro Poroshenko, has ruled out pushing for any elections while the war is ongoing, saying that they would only help Putin.\n* Zelensky claimed that another Russian command post was hit in Kursk, with many Russian officers and North Korean troops killed. This claim is unconfirmed, but they have successfully carried out strikes like this in the past, so it's a credible claim.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 20,218 (+150)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,734 (+24)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,443 (+54)\n* Russian SPG losses: 877 (+6)\n* Russian SAM losses: 299 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 135 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 151 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 7,746 (+115)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,062 (+15)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,204 (+30)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 458 (+6)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 166 (+0)\n\nHeavy losses on both sides this week. Ukrainian losses have definitely ticked up the past few weeks, while this week Russian losses have returned to their usual dire state after a few weeks of lighter losses.\n\nSlava Ukraine!",

    "selftext": "Recent reports suggest that U.S.-Russia negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine are quietly progressing, despite official denials. It appears that the U.S. may be encouraging Vladimir Putin’s demand that Ukraine hold elections before serious peace talks can begin. In a strikingly ironic development, figures close to President Trump have questioned President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s legitimacy, parroting Russian media claims that they will not negotiate with an \"unelected\" leader. This contradiction is glaring: Putin, who recently secured another term in a highly controlled and undemocratic election, now demands democratic elections in Ukraine—a government he has long dismissed as illegitimate and actively worked to undermine.\nRussia’s History of Election Interference\nRussia has a well-documented history of election interference and political manipulation in Eastern Europe. Before the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Moscow controlled puppet governments within Ukraine, just as it does today in Moldova, Hungary, and Belarus. Georgia is another target of Russian influence. The strategic advantage of having a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine is evident: it would be far easier for Moscow to manipulate a friendly government than to continue military aggression.\nIf elections in Ukraine were forced under these conditions, there is a real risk that Russia could covertly install a more compliant administration, mirroring past tactics. The presence of Russian forces, widespread disinformation campaigns, and direct interference in the electoral process could tilt the outcome in Russia’s favor. The Kremlin would not need to conquer Kyiv militarily if it could simply secure a government willing to make concessions on its behalf.\nPresident Trump as a \"Peacemaker\"—A Risky Gamble\nWith President Trump now brokering a peace deal that aligns with Russian demands, he could present himself as a diplomatic peacemaker—fulfilling a major campaign promise. However, this would come at a great cost to Ukraine’s sovereignty.\nA likely scenario could play out as follows:\n1. A \"peace deal\" is reached under the condition that Ukraine holds elections and does not join NATO, satisfying Russian demands.\n2. Putin spins the agreement as a victory, allowing him time to rebuild his military and refine his tactics based on lessons from 2022 onward.\n3. A weakened Ukraine, now led by a compromised government and plagued by corruption, sees its armed forces gradually dismantled.\n4. After President Trump leaves office, Russia invades again, facing little resistance from a Ukraine without NATO backing.\n5. Europe stands by, unable or unwilling to intervene, as Ukraine is crushed by a reinvigorated Russian military.\nThis is not just speculation. Historical patterns suggest that Russia views ceasefires and negotiations as strategic pauses rather than genuine resolutions. Putin has shown time and again that he uses peace talks to buy time, rearm, and prepare for further aggression, as seen in Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014).\nCan Elections Even Happen in Ukraine?\nThe very notion of elections in wartime Ukraine raises critical concerns. Key questions include:\n* What defines Ukrainian territory? Will elections be held in occupied areas? If so, can the legitimacy of those votes be assured, given that Russia has confiscated passports and forcibly relocated thousands of Ukrainians? The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that over 20,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russian-controlled areas for \"rehoming\" with Russian families—a clear violation of international law.\n* Who will oversee the elections? If Russia refuses to recognize a Ukrainian election commission, would an independent body—perhaps the European Union—be acceptable? Given Russia’s history of rejecting \"biased\" observers, any neutral oversight would likely be dismissed unless it aligns with Kremlin interests.\n* Will Russian troops leave occupied areas? If Russian soldiers remain present in Ukrainian cities, the potential for voter coercion, intimidation, or outright election fraud is enormous.\nUnder these conditions, fair elections in Ukraine seem impossible. This situation is reminiscent of Soviet-era tactics, where \"democratic\" votes were staged under duress, allowing Moscow to claim legitimacy while maintaining total control.\nThe Battle of Economies: Why Ukraine Should Hold On\nDespite battlefield challenges, Russia faces significant long-term economic and military strain. Analysts estimate that Russia's economy and war machine will become increasingly unsustainable by 2025, due to the cumulative effects of sanctions, military losses, and declining oil revenues. While Russia is currently advancing in some areas, Ukraine may have a strategic advantage in the long run by outlasting Russia economically.\nIf Ukraine is pressured into premature peace talks that favor Russia, it risks losing this long-term advantage. Instead, Kyiv should focus on sustaining Western military and economic aid while continuing to resist Russian advances.\nThe Role of the U.S. and Europe\nThe United States, as Ukraine’s largest military donor, plays a crucial role in shaping the future of the war. If President Trump views Ukraine’s rejection of elections as a refusal to negotiate, he may cut U.S. aid—weakening Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. This, in turn, could prolong the war by forcing Ukraine into a defensive posture with limited resources.\nEurope, too, must step up. Early in the war, European nations were criticized for their fragmented and hesitant response. If the U.S. retreats from its role as Ukraine’s primary backer, European powers—particularly Britain, France, Germany, Poland, and Sweden—must present a unified front at the negotiating table. Failure to do so would signal to Russia that Europe has no meaningful commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty.\nConclusion: A Dangerous Precedent\nIf the rumored U.S.-Russia negotiations push Ukraine toward an election under duress, the consequences will be dire. Russia will use this opportunity to undermine Ukraine from within, setting the stage for a future invasion. The lesson from past conflicts is clear: appeasement and premature peace deals often lead to greater wars.\nUkraine must resist external pressure to hold elections under Russian terms. The West, especially the United States and Europe, must recognize that negotiations cannot come at the cost of Ukraine’s sovereignty. For President Trump, the choice is whether to seek a short-term \"peace deal\" for political gain or to stand against Russian aggression in a meaningful way.\nThe future of Ukraine—and the stability of Eastern Europe—depends on this decision.\nSources\n* Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Reports on Russian deportations of Ukrainian children (2023).\n* U.S. State Department, Assessments of Russian electoral interference (2022).\n* The Telegraph, \"Ukraine: The Latest\" Podcast.\n* BBC, \"Russia’s Military and Economic Challenges in Ukraine\" (2024).\n* NATO Reports, \"The Implications of a Russian Victory in Ukraine\" (2023).\n",

At any rate, this makes it one of the earliest and most grand of the Kyivan Rus burials, and its revealed artifacts definitely confirm its chronological place during one of the most fascinating periods of Kyivan Rus development more than 1000 years ago: the time of King [Volodymyr Velykyi](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/w9xibs/520_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_155th_day_of/).\n\nLocal lore tells you that Chorna Mohyla is the grave of **Prince Chornyi**, the legendary founder of Chernihiv, which was the second most prosperous city of the Kyivan Rus besides Kyiv itself.\n\nAnd archaeologically, the mound *was* the resting place of three members of the Kyivan Rus elite, perhaps even two princes; two warriors were found with helmets and chain mail... and one woman with a collection of scythes at her feet.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Bling\n\n[You can't take it with you.

The upper portion of the mound betrays evidence of a truly grand funeral banquet, with coins, fine arms and armor and even a cauldron filled with ram bones.\n\nAnd, of course, many swords.\n\n[Sword found at Chorna Mohyla](https://preview.redd.it/ty70evv63ode1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b45be81ba3d3ba75edb07743b04cb646399cde95)\n\nThere was even a statue of Thor himself!

So, even though an active defeat of Russia is the best possible outcome, failing that, what some might call appeasement will actually represent disenfranchisement of the leading force in this evil. We will be spotlighting his failures as a leader by removing the distraction the war represents.

Despite our best efforts the list of children is getting longer every year. \nI have 52 names left on the list (a gift is around $60 on average) and until the end of January I will be putting everything I’ve got into getting every single kid on it what they have asked for.\n\nMy last peaceful memory of Kyiv is streaming on Reddit from St. Nicholas cathedral in 2022, just a day before the invasion.

    "selftext": "Dear Ukrainian people!\nI am speaking in front of the Mother Ukraine monument. A Ukraine that stands firmly, that is not bowing her head, that looks ahead of her, believes in her future and in victory over the evil Russia brought us. A Ukraine with a sword and a shield, capable of securing a just peace. Of protecting her people, her colours, her independence. Today I’m addressing everyone who values Ukraine, protects their country, and whose words \"This is my country\" are filled with love. I am grateful to you for 2024. To you, Ukrainian people, who overcome hardship with dignity. People who pride themselves on being Ukrainian. I too pride myself on being the president of such people, of Ukrainian people who show that no cruise missile can defeat a people that has wings.\nDuring this year, a leap year, we proved this daily. We saw this yesterday, when we were overjoyed at the return of 189 Ukrainians from Russian captivity. They will celebrate the arrival of the new year at home. Because we’re bringing our people back, 1,358 people this year, 3,956 people [since the beginning of the full-scale invasion]. These are not estimates but exact numbers, because behind these numbers are people, our people, people who matter to us. With each person we bring back, we also bring back life.\n\nAnd we all cry each time this happens. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a mother moved to tears, or a child who finally got to see their dad again, or the President of Ukraine – we all cry, because we are all humans, and we have all managed to preserve our inner light.\nThis light has helped us stand our ground for more than 1,000 days now. To be brave when it is so needed. To be strong when it is so needed. This is what our teachers, doctors, energy and transport workers, air defence personnel and mobile fire units have done. Soldiers who have shot down 1,310 cruise and ballistic missiles and 7,800 Iranian Shahed drones this year. Bravo! We are so proud of them! We are so grateful. We made it through this year together. Together we overcame everything this year brought: victories and defeats, triumphs and challenges, tears of joy when we managed what we set out to do, and tears of pain when we encountered setbacks and had our hearts broken.\nA morning in July. Okhmatdyt children’s hospital. Only weak people and cowards act like that. We will never forget those kids’ eyes. And we will never forgive! When evil brings death, we respond by forming a human chain. That’s what Ukrainian people’s strength looks like. Our unity was visible from space. God saw it. Saw our people, our kids. And I will never forget the eyes of the little boy from Okhmatdyt, a grown-up’s eyes, so full of resolve, of life, of energy and dignity. This one child is so much stronger than Putin. All of our children are so much stronger than Russia’s evil. Ukrainian boys and girls, who are winning this war, studying online and in basements, winning international science olympiads, raising money for our army, coming up with inventive technical solutions to bolster our defence. You are an incredible generation! You are who we’re fighting for. You are who our heroes, our soldiers are defending. The people holding the line and carrying Ukraine’s independence on their shoulders. On every front, where bravery and valour are fighting every day, including today, on New Year’s Eve. On every front. In the east, where the situation is extremely challenging. But we believe and we know: they will stand. Our soldiers will stand. Their spirit and their bravery will stand. Everything that has enabled you to not surrender our Sumy and Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, however much the Russians wanted to capture those cities. Instead, you have repaid the occupiers by bringing the war to their home, to Russia. And those who brought evil to our land now sow it on theirs, in Kursk Oblast and other places that became targets of our attacks, of our justice. Justice. Just one word, but hundreds of thousands of our people stand behind it. Our defence industry and our science, which worked to make us stronger, with 30% of weapons and equipment our soldiers used on the battlefield this year having been made in Ukraine.\n",

For example, authentic carols were substituted with songs about communism and Lenin, the communist star replaced the Bethlehem Star on the Christmas tree, and Ded Moroz (“Grandfather Frost” – translator’s note) took the place of Saint Nicholas.**\n\n[Russian anti-bourgeois\\/'West' propaganda](https://preview.redd.it/u6ss2ef0hb8e1.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78539d68278a94e4f41862851ebe39aea888cdc6)\n\nChristmas holidays were deliberately designated as working days, and in the evenings, communist officials patrolled the streets, recording the names of those celebrating Christmas. There were also instances of detentions and arrests, the most well-known being the “Arrested Carolers” case of 1972.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li3wey2tfb8e1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84a14fabb7e6d09cbd2fd4d86edc0559fab49357\n\n**The arrest of carolers in Kyiv and Lviv**\n\nOn 12 January, 1972, the KGB arrested participants of a Christmas carol — 19 individuals in total from Lviv and Kyiv. Among those detained were young intellectuals and artists, including poet Vasyl Stus, literary critic Ivan Svitlychnyi, publicist Viacheslav Chornovil, poetess Iryna Stasiv-Kalynets, artist Stefania Shabatura, and philosopher Yevhen Sverstiuk.\n\n[Ihor Kalynets](https://preview.redd.it/pvg7vhwxfb8e1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26962f92cb3affecc1f6c27a362070c0bc94b4ad)\n\nUkrainian writer Ihor Kalynets recalls:\n\n&gt;“Those who were meant to be arrested (whether the caroling took place or not) were already on the lists. The investigations had largely been conducted for each of them, and they were all set to be arrested anyway. Many of us were not dissidents. We were Ukrainian patriots.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6ndcm70gb8e1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38d21b2faa1ef8f169f52788296e478965620a17\n\n**Christmas ban in Kharkiv**\n\nDespite the persecution of carolers, by the late 1980s, a branch of the Ukrainian Youth Association emerged in Kharkiv, establishing an annual tradition of organising Vertep (Nativity) plays and caroling for local children and youth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kyt37mn2gb8e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbffd231596ff569c93f0b2751d8cfd1ff266de6\n\nKostiantyn Cheremskyi, a counselor with the Ukrainian Youth Association, recalls going caroling from apartment to apartment in 1982–83. At the time, communist authorities set up “parent patrols” at building entrances to stop anyone from entering. Despite the ongoing repression, the tradition of caroling in Kharkiv persisted:\n\n&gt;“We tried not to photograph the Vertep plays because, unfortunately, everything was being monitored and watched. Unlike in puppet nativity scenes, everyone was dressed up in handmade costumes or improvisatory clothing, and performed plays for themselves. They passed this tradition on to our group. We enriched it, modernized it, and began actively implementing it in life.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ao8sod4gb8e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4057ea09f1d42decdb1217ed89c8d5d84896c9e8\n\n**The forbidden caroling in Kryvorivnia**\n\nDuring the Soviet regime, both the church and caroling were prohibited in the Carpathian village of Kryvorivnia. The Hutsuls (Carpathian highlanders) secretly preserved their traditions, caroling in the remote upper areas of the village to avoid detection, as punishment from the authorities was a real threat. In urban areas, carol lyrics were sometimes altered to replace Jesus with Lenin, as the KGB actively targeted carolers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm2ea236gb8e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0a9399fae1f97e29441b45506eaeaeb5ff6ac8f\n\nThe participant of caroling in Kryvorivnia, Ivan Zelenchuk, speaks about these traditions:\n\n&gt;“The highlanders danced near our church, and some people from Kryvorivnia joined them, too. They danced near the church almost every year. And it was something, you know, when you heard that dance, it truly struck a chord in your soul. There was nothing criminal about it, nothing anti-government in those carols.”\n\n**The dispersal of Malanka in Beleluia**\n\nIn the Halych village of Beleluia in the west of Ukraine, as in nearby regions, the celebration of Malanka (a traditional Ukrainian folk New Year celebration, involving vibrant costumes, merrymaking, often featuring masked performances and role-playing – ed.) was banned in the latter part of the 20th century. Villagers recall that even when the police arrived to break up the Malanka festivities, the head of the local cultural club, Mykhailo Herlib, encouraged the costumed performers to stand their ground and carry on with the celebration. Ultimately, they succeeded in upholding their traditions, though Herlib was later summoned by Soviet officials for questioning and required to submit written explanations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wq5sa1i9gb8e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f7e47953eb291cf5cde9e81eee38507c439823\n\nThis is how Mykhailo Herlib, Director of the cultural center at the People’s House in Beleluia, describes these events:\n\n&gt;“I was part of the Malanka festivities at the time, and both the KGB and the police summoned me. They didn’t like it when people gathered or united. They disliked such traditions. I had to spend a month going to the KGB, writing explanations, and asserting in writing that the Malanka festivities had no religious content whatsoever.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1033rd day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦  \n",

    "selftext": "# The 12 Dishes of Sviata Vecheria\n\nIn today's post we’ll focus on one of the most characteristic Ukrainian holiday traditions: the magical traditional dinner on Christmas Eve called **Sviata Vecheria (\"Holy Dinner\")**.\n\nThere's a lot to cover regarding Ukrainian Holiday traditions, which are so colorful.  To help elucidate, we've collaborated with a famed Ukrainian food anthropologist slash popular blogger named **Pani Stefa**! If my fantasy of the [r/Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ukraine/) sunrise post readership making a Ukrainian holiday dinner for their loved ones is going to come true for at least one of you, we need to get going!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Like a Circle\n\n[Sviata Vecheria.](https://preview.redd.it/knm58rjlzi7e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141f95c72c45e6853e14c83e145b9c45805ab748)\n\nThe tradition of **Sviata Vecheria** has very ancient origins[,](https://imgur.com/a/sJYECPp) and most likely originally was tied to the celebration of the Winter Solstice, called Koliada. This holiday eventually melded with Christmas traditions in the dual-faith folk tradition. Ukrainians had a big reason to celebrate this day, as they believed that this is the day when the deity Koliada gives birth to a new Sun. Koliada’s name is derived from *kolo* \\- \"circle,\" and most likely represents the cyclicity of the year and life.\n\nBut, as it turns out, not *everyone* is happy that Koliada is creating the new Sun. Mara, the goddess we wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/yi1c75/647_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_250th_day_of/), is very unhappy about this development, in fact. To Mara, a new Sun means the end of the winter and long dark nights, which Mara enjoys very much. So Mara hunts for Koliada so she can stop the new Sun from being born, but every year she does not succeed. Koliada finds a way to hide, and even transforms into a goat to evade Mara. That is why during Christmas celebrations even today sometimes kids dress up as goats.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Look for a Star\n\n[Koliada motifs.](https://preview.redd.it/x8qu4n1rzi7e1.png?width=1839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ddb93de0fc70818f145f69ea4294585dabfcb0f)\n\nChristmas Eve Dinner is of course a family holiday, like everywhere else in the world where this holiday is celebrated. Ukrainians believe that even the souls of ancestors gather for a festive Christmas Eve dinner, which is why there is always an extra set of dishes on the table for the family members that died. Extra sets of dishes are set for family members that are traveling far away and could not make it home, for example if they are off saving the world (fighting russians).\n\nLiving family members should be at home all day. Breakfast and lunch on that day is not allowed! Fasting is required for all, except for sick and small children. Any household chores, needlework, heavy physical labor are also not allowed - only light food preparation and light decorations are appropriate.\n\nSpecial attention is paid to decorating the table: hay is laid out on the table, and a tablecloth is laid on top. Then several cloves of garlic are placed at the corners of the table to ensure the health of the family and protect it from evil spirits. Candles are lit, and a festive loaf of bread is placed at the head of the table as a symbol of abundance and prosperity.\n\nWhen the first star is visible in the sky, it is finally time for the family to sit down at the table. You can imagine impatient folks with their mouths watering, running outside every five minutes to check if there is a star visible yet. And it's important that, before taking a seat, you blow on the chair gently so you do not accidentally sit on the soul of a visiting family member.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Solemnity\n\n[Cozy at home.](https://preview.redd.it/v8doozatzi7e1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33f1a2bd2448b159bc8dcc32c38c52c07bdf3839)\n\nThe dinner itself needs to consist of 12 dishes. Some say it is because Jesus is supposed to have had twelve apostles, and others believe it is tied to the twelve months of the year. All dishes are lean, and decadent dishes that contain meat, butter and cheese are served only on the next day. In other words, Christmas Eve dinner is festive, yes... but also solemn.\n\nThe 12 dishes vary in different areas of Ukraine. In the west regions of Ukraine, vegetable, mushroom and fish dishes predominate, while in Central and Southern Ukraine many dishes are prepared from flour - buns, dumplings, pies. However, there are several dishes that are present in the list of 12 dishes no matter if you are in a village in the Kharkiv region or can see the Carpathian mountains from your window.\n\nThe non-negotiable dishes of *Sviata Vecheria* are:\n\n* [Kutya](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/zt5tip/757_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_303rd_day_of_the/) \\- a mystical dish, the soul of the dinner, that we cannot wait to tell you about. It is associated with many interesting folk rituals.\n* **Bread** \\- most likely kolach, which we wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/z5s5c8/). Kolach probably derives its name from the same word root as 'Koliada': *kolo* (circle).\n* [Uzvar](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/zoqixh/754_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_298th_day_of_the/) \\- a drink made of dried fruit.\n* **Holubtsi** \\- Cabbage rolls (we wrote about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/yzuud7/720_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_270th_day_of/)), or cabbage soup\n* **Borshch**, a special version called [Christmas Borshch](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/znyi0o/753_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_297th_day_of/) that is generally made only twice a year - for this event and the Epiphany - the beating heart of the dinner. We will bring you this recipe, curated by Pani Stefa, later this week!\n\nOther dishes could include:\n\n* Dumplings with mushroom stuffing\n* Mushroom gravy or pickled mushrooms\n* [Varenyky](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/18uyrw1/758_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_676th/) (traditionally without cheese)\n* Ukrainian donuts\n* Makivnyk (we wrote about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xncn7u/648_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_213th_day_of/))\n* Fish, traditionally herring but other fish as well\n* Stuffed Buns with various fillings: mushrooms, dried fruit, cabbage, bean paste\n* And others, depending on family tradition!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI personally try to make the dinner as authentic as possible, without using ingredients that are “newer” to Ukrainian cuisine. This means I skip rice, tomatoes and potatoes.\n\nOf course, this philosophy is a slippery slope; one could argue that a traditional dinner long ago probably did not even include red beets (a major component of Borshch) as these are not entirely native plants to the Ukrainian landscape - and that is a compelling argument. Research has also shown that “fancy” desserts are of a newer origin and in the past, nuts and honey were eaten instead. I do not have a good answer for this inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps it's just my attempt to connect to a pre-Soviet Ukraine that had no yet seen what will happen to her. Perhaps I am trying to connect to my ancestors. After dinner - after the living have gone to sleep - the ancestors stay around at the table. We don't remove the dishes, and leave some food and bread so the dead can enjoy the meal. And I want them to taste it the way they remember it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Sviata Vecheria on the frontlines, January 2022, before the full-scale invasion.](https://preview.redd.it/dve45r9yzi7e1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87948489ecb5fca314afde030397022582263b80)\n\n[Sviata Vecheria on the front, 2023.](https://preview.redd.it/8ckelce33j7e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d01c7db9a7e17a1f833a5c0860fff2db913d31b1)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1029th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

The custom of caroling has an ancient history with roots that go back way back to pre-Christian times. There was a myth that the old Sun was killed by a snake-god called Korotun, who would swallow it, and Koliada (a goddess whose name comes from the word kolo i.e. circle), would give birth to a new Sun. We already told you about how Koliada did not have an easy time giving birth to a new Sun, as she was chased by Mara. Yet she would always prevail (at least in the history of humans) and people celebrated with a feast, celebrations and songs.\n\nThese songs were named Koliada songs, or Koliadky, from the name of the goddess, and we call them carols today. Most Koliadky would not mention any Christmas-related themes until much, much later. Originally they were simply about the new Sun, and the happiness and hope for the next year.\n\nCarolers (or Koliadnyky), would carry a big, richly-decorated star with them, and it was able to spin; this elaborate object symbolizes the new Sun, and the cyclical aspects of nature and life.\n\n[Close up of a Koliada star.](https://preview.redd.it/9r5zyny4747e1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f271cd05eec3e76c906e49d3132e5fb213605027)\n\nThis custom is incredibly popular; in one village alone, it was common for competing groups of  to try and outdo each other with their elaborate costumes and impressive singing. This practice is still in effect today, and caroling can be a little competitive in some areas!\n\n[Koliada folk art.

Others would be dressed in masks to represent the spirits of ancestors who were visiting Earth on this day.\n\nWith time, after Christianity came to Ukrainian lands, the nature of caroling started to have more of a focus on the nativity. The funny thing is, the Goat stayed and remained the most beloved character despite having no confirmed role in the story of the birth of Jesus Christ. :) Even today, most Koliadnykys - even if they do not dress up in any other costumes - will have a *Koza* (the Goat) in their group.\n\n[This band is rocking out!](https://preview.redd.it/qg4omvw8747e1.png?width=1049&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f4d4559bc59ce11067a5b2d00383d2b49a099f9)\n\n[Huge Koliada stars in Lviv.](https://preview.redd.it/be6q4rx9747e1.png?width=1575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60056012d102bc2311730d7df91faec91ef55235)\n\n[Kids of Kyiv.](https://preview.redd.it/pf5hjexa747e1.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=279097cef7efe6031fca3c4263ede31c55ecc76d)\n\n[Koza always steals the limelight!](https://preview.redd.it/ycw8q34c747e1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34ffbe6d3234a96885f5d81b13378fea40fab5a0)\n\nCaroling would continue for days, all the way until the Epiphany in mid-January. But after about a week, during the celebration of the new year, Koliadky songs would be replaced with songs called *Shchedrivky*, which are specifically dedicated to wish a good harvest and prosperity to the household. The song *Shchedryk* we wrote about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xelz43/633_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_204th_day_of/) \\- the one that is so famous for Christmas around the world as 'Carol of the Bells' - is actually a *Shchedrivka*, a New Year’s song.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Receiving the Carolers\n\n[Detail from a painting called \\\\\"Carols in Ukraine\\\\\" by Konstantin Trutovskyi \\(1864\\).](https://preview.redd.it/i9uk65ne747e1.png?width=1136&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50009df9169ae1c38ad4fdfa19fffaa4d8706d29)\n\nCarolers would often start singing under the window of a house, without walking into the home. It was believed that the souls of ancestors came home that day through the windows, so the Koliadnykys would make sure that both worlds would hear them - the world of the living and the dead. Then the hosts of the home would invite Koliadnyky into the home so the singing would continue. If time allows (Koliadnyky needed to visit all houses in the village), they would sit at the table. To receive carolers was a great honor, and hosts would be eager to reward them with treats and *nalyvkas* (drinks).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Singing in the Dark\n\nNot all Koliadky are ancient. Some newer ones have been written even in the dark time of soviet union repressions. One of them is “Sad Christmas Eve in ‘46” that talks about a hungry winter after WW2, when Ukrainians found themselves in the darkness of Soviet occupation, political repressions and third Holodomor that was artificially created by russians to refill their coffers after WW2 and continue their destruction of the Ukrainian people.\n\nWhile so many around the world celebrated the end of the horrific world war and began to restore their spirits, Ukrainians continued to endure the inhuman conditions of occupation, Gulag, and starvation. The story has it that this Christmas carol was sung many years after, but with the year being changed to ‘47, ‘48 etc. As the song was sung underground for many years, there are many different versions of it - we translated just one for you:\n\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1026th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

During the Revolution of Dignity, she worked at a makeshift hospital in the Parliamentary Library, providing aid to the wounded (during the rallies, volunteers self-organised to treat peaceful protesters attacked by pro-government forces – ed). The events of the Revolution of Dignity inspired her to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine to defend the country’s sovereignty. Yulia volunteered in the medical service Hospitallers (a Ukrainian volunteer medical unit founded in 2014 to offer emergency medical assistance and evacuation for military personnel in combat zones – ed.), serving in combat zones and rescuing injured soldiers. Yulia admits that she has always felt drawn to danger zones and is eager to be as helpful as possible.\n\n&gt;*The Revolution of Dignity (Euromaidan) was a series of nationwide Ukrainian protests from late 2013 to early 2014, sparked by the suspension of an EU association agreement. The protests resulted in the ousting of Ukraine's pro-Russian President Yanukovych and the subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine.*\n\nIn 2017, Yulia founded her own medical service called Ulf, driven by her desire to build something based on her vision.\n\n“Over time, I felt like I had given everything I could there. I wasn’t growing anymore. I don’t like staying in one place. Additionally, emotional burnout and depression also started to take their toll — these factors also led me to leave the front in 2019.”\n\n[Photo source: The Women Veterans Movement.](https://preview.redd.it/mwb96mebbj6e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4e1c424631164c0984122c3d69b51f5d76b236)\n\nAfter the start of the full-scale invasion, Yulia returned to military service, this time as a paramedic. In 2022, she took charge of the medical service within the Women Veterans Movement.\n\n“We established a Rapid Response Headquarters for the Women’s Veteran Movement, and the medical crew is just one aspect of our work. In terms of medical care, I focus more on quality. I don’t need many vehicles and personnel; what truly matters is that the evacuation transport is equipped with the necessary resuscitation equipment and experienced specialists I trust are close at hand. While we may create new teams in the future, we first need to find individuals willing to train according to TCCC standards. For me, this is a must. Even if someone has a medical background, I wouldn’t bring them on without knowledge of combat protocols.”\n\n**The impact of Ukraine’s Women Veterans Movement**\n\nThe number of women in the Ukrainian army is steadily increasing. As of July 2024, over 10,000 female service members are actively engaged in combat missions on the front lines. In total, more than 67,000 women serve in the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n[Photo source: The Women Veterans Movement.

It advocates for overcoming stereotypical views of women in Ukraine, highlighting their right to participate in various aspects of public life.\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThank you for reading this series!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1024th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

However, modern societies are increasingly rejecting these beliefs. In Ukraine, the decade-long war against Russia has demonstrated how crucial women’s contribution can be. It has shown that gender stereotypes need to be discarded, and at times of war, the entire society has to come together for a common goal — to defeat the enemy.\n\nIn Ukraine, the idea of gender equality in the military is championed by The Women Veterans Movement (WVM), also known as Veteranka. The movement emerged from the “Invisible Battalion” campaign, initiated in 2015 by veteran Maria Berlinska. Initially, the campaign explored the role of Ukrainian women in the war against Russia. It also aimed to raise awareness about the challenges faced by female service members, as well as to ensure equal conditions for women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine at the legislative level. Due to the “Invisible Battalion” efforts, the list of combat positions available to women in Ukraine has been significantly expanded.\n\nIn 2018, the “Invisible Battalion” led to the establishment of the public organisation Women Veterans Movement. This entity was the first in Ukraine to raise the issue of providing adequate material and technical support for female defenders at the state level. As of today, it has grown into a strong community of female veterans and service members who not only support each other but also drive change within the country.\n\n# The work of the Women Veterans Movement during the full-scale Russian invasion\n\nSince 24 February 2022, most female veterans have returned to the front lines, while others, along with many other Ukrainian women, have joined the Women Veterans Movement as volunteers. They provide support through a rapid response headquarters, which was set up the day after the Russian full-scale invasion broke out.\n\nKateryna Pryimak, the organisation’s head, says the Women Veterans Movement is working hard to effectively meet the needs of female defenders on the front lines.\n\n“In the two years since the full-scale invasion started, we have raised over 90 million hryvnias (roughly $2,135,000) for the front lines, not counting the support from our partners. The movement has delivered 98 vehicles, 1,961 drones, 34,000 pieces of ammunition and gear, and more.”\n\n[Kateryna Pryimak. Photo source: The Women Veterans Movement.](https://preview.redd.it/yb6zrh8j2q5e1.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9046c1c8f06561d27d9b5908dad85c3a4c400b)\n\nKateryna shares that the movement has become a strong community for her, one that empowers her to drive change in the country.\n\n“I am very proud of the organisation and the team. I can see how much we have grown. I remember how we started, and the difference in our development is huge. What I’m most proud of is that we don’t stop and have many more achievements to come. I’m proud of all the advocacy work we have done and our community, which now has over a thousand female veterans.”\n\nThe full-scale war has introduced new challenges, particularly regarding the proper state provision for female service members. The female defenders needed help not just with purchasing drones, vehicles, or night vision equipment but also with basic gear such as military uniforms, body armour, and helmets. At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, finding suitable clothing became one of the most common issues. At that time, Ukraine had only approved ceremonial military uniforms for women. As a result, Ukrainian women joining the Armed Forces received standard men’s uniforms they had to wear during service. Women often had to alter their uniforms or come up with creative ways to make them more comfortable — like using safety pins or belts. The Armed Forces also didn’t provide helmets, body armour, footwear, or even underwear specifically designed for women.\n\n[Photo source: The Women Veterans Movement.](https://preview.redd.it/e39d9zpg2q5e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a4d9cee8fe1e40b3b7959e1270e94a4dfde1a1d)\n\nThe first female military uniforms were issued only in February 2024 and were summer field outfits. Before that, women had to either sew or alter their uniforms themselves or get them from volunteers and Ukrainian organisations. The Women Veterans Movement established its workshop to produce both winter and summer uniforms for female defenders. The organisation was one of the first in Ukraine to introduce field uniforms tailored to fit the anatomical features of women’s bodies. Over the past two years, Veteranka has produced and distributed around 700 sets of such uniforms for free to female defenders. In addition, the movement also manufactures camouflage coats for scouts, gaiters for artillery crews, and covers for drones, Stingers (an American portable surface-to-air missile system – ed.), and small infantry shovels.\n\n[Photo source: The Women Veterans Movement.](https://preview.redd.it/b3jzxn192q5e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1516a4e8cfe1843a9f0d18b4166a96518ed5e7e)\n\nVeteranka also organises charity events, having successfully hosted over 50 of them that featured celebrities. They also held two charity photo exhibitions showcasing works created by female defenders and movement members. The Women Veteran Movement has collaborated with over 100 organisations and influencers and launched numerous awareness campaigns to raise funds for female defenders and their units. One notable campaign was the fundraiser game “Legend of Sister’s Power”, which raised nearly $150,000. This money was used to purchase 1,200 pairs of boots, seven drones, three vehicles, and five night vision devices. Another initiative, the “Ukraine on the Line” flash mob fundraiser, raised about $75,000 to buy communication equipment for the 35th Separate Marine Brigade named after Rear Admiral Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi.\n\nVeteranka is also working on establishing a robust mechanism within the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) to combat sexual harassment and gender-based violence. In March, Kateryna Pryimak submitted a petition on the President of Ukraine’s website addressing this issue. The petition notes that dozens of sexual harassment cases have been reported within the AFU, many of which remain unresolved and the perpetrators unpunished. The petition has already gathered more than the required 25,000 signatures and is currently under consideration by the President. Among their new projects, the organisation is preparing a campaign to encourage more women to join the military.\n\n[Kateryna Pryimak with fellow sisters from the Veteranka movement.

The members promote a proactive approach to reintegrating into Ukrainian civilian society and advocate for changes in the rehabilitation system. The organisation provides support to injured women, offering assistance and guidance during the recovery process for female service members.\n\nThey also extend their support for the families of military personnel, female veterans, and internally displaced persons facing difficult circumstances. In this regard, Veteranka offers assistance tailored to individual needs, providing both group and individual sessions with psychologists who focus on improving women’s mental health.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Join us tomorrow for vignettes from the experiences of Veteranka members!**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1020th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

    "selftext": "\nSweden, a new NATO member, has a jet that was designed for war with Russia.\nBut it has never been used in that kind of combat.\nGiving Ukraine the jet would strengthen its air force and benefit NATO, warfare analysts said.\n\nSweden's Gripen, a fighter jet built for a war with Russia, is considered a good fit for Ukraine, but the aircraft hasn't been tested the way it could be in this war.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has been a test bed for weapons on both sides, from Russia's new hypersonic missiles to older systems such as the American Patriots, showing their users how they perform in high-end combat. Some systems have underperformed, while others have far exceeded expectations in this tough operating environment.\n\n\nUkrainian army tests new Western weapons as NATO boosts supplies\nNot only could giving the jets to Ukraine — which Stockholm has indicated is possible — strengthen its air force, but it could also give NATO insight into how a key capability performs in a real-world combat scenario, specifically one for which it was made.\n\nHelpful for NATO\nSweden initially refused to put its jet on the table for Ukraine, but it has slowly become more open to the idea. The defense ministry said in September that it was acquiring Gripen parts, and in late November, it was reported that those parts were being transferred to Ukraine.\n\nIt is, however, unclear whether Ukraine will receive the actual jets and when that would happen. Sweden's defense minister, Pål Jonson, said recently that his country had been advised to wait until Ukraine was further along in setting up its new American-made F-16 fleet. Concerns have been raised about unintentionally overloading Kyiv with new equipment.\n\nBut at some point down the road, there's the possibility Kyiv receives the Gripen, a rugged, capable fourth-generation fighter.\n\nDesigned at the end of the Cold War, the jet is operated by about half a dozen countries. It was built to fight Russia's Sukhoi fighter aircraft, but it's never been in that kind of combat.\n\nTwo fighter jets on the ground, with a pilot siting in one of them and another person standing beside it.\nA JAS-39 Gripen at a military base near Prague in 2005. REUTERS/Petr Josek PJ/AA\nTim Robinson, a military-aviation specialist at the UK's Royal Aeronautical Society, told Business Insider the aircraft was designed to fit into Sweden's vision of having a dispersed and mobile air force to counter Russia as a threat. \"The idea of keeping on the move, rapid turnarounds, and being very, very hard to destroy,\" he said.\n\n\nHe said NATO would be interested in seeing how the jet performs against Russia, especially given the aircraft has \"quite a good electronic warfare system,\" which this fight has shown is necessary to defeat Russia.\n\nAir-to-air combat isn't common in Ukraine, but George Barros, a warfare expert at the Institute for the Study of War think tank, told BI that \"there may be some tactical advantages that Sweden can learn from Gripen's performance against Russian planes.\" It could also benefit the larger NATO alliance.\n\nSweden joined NATO in March of this year as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the alliance celebrated the move as one that would help it in the event of a conflict with Russia. That's because of Sweden's geographical location and because its military was built around the Russia threat.\n\nA Saab JAS 39C Gripen aircraft in flight.\nSweden's Saab Gripen. Oleg V. Belyakov - AirTeamImages\nAnd there are benefits for the jet's manufacturers as well. Michael Bohnert, a warfare expert at the RAND Corporation, said Saab is in \"global competition\" with its rivals as countries seek fourth-generation fighters. That means Sweden — as well as France, which has offered Ukraine Mirage aircraft — \"both have strong incentives to provide aircraft with high performance and support to Ukraine.\"\n\nRelated stories\nRobinson said that having a jet proven in combat is \"definitely a factor when selling military aircraft.\"\n\nThe Gripen was used in Libya in 2011, but it was only for reconnaissance. The models that Ukraine would probably get are the older C and D models, but if those versions were to do well in Ukraine, it could still help the sale and reputation of newer models now being produced.\n\nAdvertisement\nRetired US Army Maj. Gen. Gordon \"Skip\" Davis, who served as NATO's deputy assistant secretary-general for its Defense Investment Division, told BI the Gripen performing well in Ukraine \"would be a great boost for Saab and Swedish defense industry.\"\n\n\"If it does well in Ukraine, then it would be the selling point,\" he said. \"But I would also tend to think that it would do well simply because the Swedes themselves have been so focused on Russia as a potential threat and enemy for quite some time.\"\n\nHelpful for Ukraine\nThe main reason to send the jets to Ukraine, though, would be to boost its airpower. Barros said that \"sending Ukraine more aircraft is a step in the right direction.\"\n\nAdvertisement\nWar experts have said the Gripen is the jet best suited for Ukraine in the long term.\n\nBohnert previously told BI that \"Gripens are a way better fit for Ukraine\" than F-16s, as they're \"a little more purpose-built\" for what Ukraine needs. \"Sweden, being under that Russian threat, designed the Gripens to fight this way that F-16s weren't,\" he said.\n\nThe aircraft was designed to work from civilian roads so that it can still function if runways and airbases are destroyed; Russia has targeted that infrastructure during the war. It also requires less maintenance than some aircraft, such as the F-16s, which is useful for a country actively at war.\n\nAdvertisement\nA Ukrainian F-16 flying against grey skies.\nA Ukrainian air force F-16 fighter jet in an undisclosed location in Ukraine. AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky\nRobinson said that \"it's almost perfect for Ukraine's needs in a way,\" but he noted that the jet has drawbacks, such as there not being as many in service as F-16s, meaning allies couldn't be as helpful with things like providing spares.\n\nUkraine's future may rely more on support from Europe with former US President Donald Trump set to take office next year. He has been more critical of support for Ukraine.\n\nPeter Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute who's a former Royal Australian Air Force officer, told BI that since the Gripen has some US-made components, the Trump administration would probably have to agree to Sweden giving Ukraine Gripens if it tried to do so. For the time being, it remains uncertain whether Sweden will ultimately commit the jets.\n\nFollow me",

Not too shabby!  However, historians now think that this may not have been possible as there are no artifacts from this time.  Other legends say that the city was founded in honor of King Volodymyr winning over the feared nomadic Pecheneg tribe in 992 and that its name may have come directly from this act; there is a theory that the word Pereiaslav could be a truncated version of words that mean “took their glory away”.\n\n[Conquering of the Pechenegs in 992.  From the Radziwiłł Chronicle.](https://preview.redd.it/fpa8azwkqb5e1.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a1c67528d13b21faf4708d7d682f42be4dfb0f7)\n\nThe city impressive enough that when some royal offspring later left Kyiv to found settlements in the north, a town called Pereiaslav was founded; this town is now in russia and confuses things when you search for it online.  So beware and choose the Pereiaslav of the Kyiv region, on the shores of our beautiful Dnipro!\n\n[White Heron at the Dnipro shore at Pereiaslav.](https://preview.redd.it/95a6gzz3rb5e1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96b7928dfcc0b2c40626b86f8a0a7f65536e236f)\n\nIn fact, it is thanks to this convenient location on the shore of one of the mightiest rivers of Europe, that the city developed rapidly.  In the late 1080s, the city gained a stone defensive wall and one of the grandest churches of Kyivan Rus, St. Michael's Cathedral.  With the rapid growth, its population reached 11,000–11,500 people.  Tragically, in March 1239, the city was devastated and destroyed by the troops of Khan Batu.  Unlike in Kyiv and Chernihiv, the Tatars established a camp here, preventing a full revival of the city and it fell into a prolonged decline.\n\nThe revival of Pereiaslav began in the end of the 16th century, as Prince and Kyiv Voivode Kostiantyn Ostrozkyi was able to settle in Pereiaslav and took it upon himself to restore the city and the community.  In 1625, five Kozak regiments were established here and in no time the city became one of the biggest Kozak centers in Ukraine.  Pereiaslav became an important supply center for weapons and provisions for the army.  During this period, Pereiaslav also served as a diplomatic hub for the state, hosting envoys from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, moscow, Hungary, the Tatars, and the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# A Deal with the Devil\n\n[Kozak gravestone in Pereiaslav.](https://preview.redd.it/jefymf8brb5e1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e86f0b7d5394ef2468efb80799d7bb1b23a2ae)\n\nWhen in 1648, Ukrainians started their war for independence with the Polish Commonwealth, the war was exhausting and bloody.  Ukrainians were desperate for allies, trying to make deals with the Tatars and Ottomans, but this alliance proved unreliable as the allies often failed to show up for the battles.  \n\nIn response, the Kozaks repeatedly approached the moscow government with proposals for a military alliance between Ukraine and the tsardom of moscow.  In October of 1653, moscow finally decided to enter the alliance and after protracted discussions, disputes and negotiations, an agreement was signed in the city of Pereiaslav.  Many debate the actual terms of this alliance; the original 1654 treaty did not survive; some speculate that it was destroyed by moscow for obvious reasons.\n\nAn agreement with moscow then was as controversial in Ukraine then as it is now; for instance, leaders in Kyiv refused to sign the agreement outright.  The short-lived benefit of having an ally proved to be a near-fatal mistake that came with an immense price.  Many believe it is the same mistake that Ukrainians are paying for to this day. \n\nAfter russians dismantled and abolished the Kozak system, the city fell into despair again.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# A Long Road Home\n\nPereiaslav slowly tried to revive itself, but its industrial development was limited.\n\nYet the cultural richness of Pereiaslav remained in everyday life.  It was a home base to the Ukrainian philosopher Hryhoriy Skovoroda.  The city also held a significant role in the life and creative journey of Ukraine’s great poet, Taras Shevchenko.  He visited Pereiaslav four times, and it was here that he composed some of his most famous works, including *Testament* (Zapovit), where he asks to be buried overlooking the Dnipro.\n\n[Room where Shevchenko wrote 'Testament', one of his most famous works.](https://preview.redd.it/yfkadbdftb5e1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=740d50b73966b1c81596d48b1e63f057ae9ffbca)\n\nAs Shevchenko described in his poems, Ukraine was ravaged by muscovites.  A substantial portion of Pereiaslav's cultural monuments was destroyed during the 1920s to 1930s, and during World War II.  Pereiaslav, like the rest of Ukraine, suffered immensely during the Holodomor of 1932–1933. Approximately 26,880 people perished in the city and surrounding area during the Holodomor. \n\nOccupiers also renamed the city, and for decades the people of Pereiaslav sought to restore the city's historical name.  It happened finally only in 2019.  A decade earlier, the ancient coat of arms of Pereiaslav was restored, and its flag was approved.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# A Living Legacy of Ukrainian History\n\n[Church of St. George at Pereiaslav Museum.

Among them are exceptional collections of archaeology, interesting plants, old prints from the 17th to early 18th centuries, and the Kozaks' Weaponry Museum.

While stories about their actions may seem amusing in hindsight, they can involve real risks for the participants at the time. Mavka One recalls a girl who went to hang up leaflets in Crimea. She found a spot near a fence to pull them out discreetly, but then she encountered someone else.\n\n“Just as she pulled them out, an old man appeared behind her. She hid the leaflets and waited for him to pass. But instead, he approached her and said, ‘I see, salt!’ \\[slang for drugs in Ukrainian — *ed*.). At first, she thought he suspected she was looking for something hidden, but she quickly realised it was serious. He grabbed her — she barely managed to hide the leaflets — and dragged her towards a house, saying he was going to interrogate her about where she bought drugs. The girl managed to escape, and everything ended well. But there was both laughter and danger involved. The old man could have called the police, and they would have found our leaflets, but thankfully, that didn’t happen.”\n\n[\\\\\"Let's clean up the Russian garbage.\\\\\" Photo source: “Zla Mavka” telegram channel.](https://preview.redd.it/9r26ug3bb55e1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9f747a5267fa479f066543dc3060402ad6073a)\n\nEven though the Mavkas carefully prepare for each outing, unexpected situations still arise. It’s a relief when a nearby stranger shares pro-Ukrainian views, as happened with Mavka One.\n\n“The scariest moment \\[I’ve had\\] so far was burning Russian flags. I didn’t want to do it in a yard; I wanted to do it right there, where the occupiers could see it, not just on Telegram. When it works out, it’s an unmatched feeling! Sometimes, I have to return to the same spot five times to get it done because something gets in the way. But one situation caught me off guard… During the process, a woman appeared. She saw me, and I saw her; we both just stood there, shocked, staring at each other. Then she smiled and said, ‘Hurry up; there’s a patrol car nearby. You better go down Street X.’ I was stunned but quickly ran off with a smile — they’re OUR people!”\n\nSupport from the outside world also boosts the women’s determination, Mavka Three shares. “When foreign journalists reach out to us, we feel like we’re doing something right. Not long ago, I came across a post by a Ukrainian soldier who noticed our work and wrote a thank-you note… It brought me to tears… We’re the ones who are grateful! We will do everything we can as long as it makes a difference…”\n\nEveryday rituals and small comforts also offer solace to the Mavkas. For Mavka Three, it’s about planning and tidying up. Mavka Two finds comfort in items that remind her of life before the full-scale war. Mavka One sometimes feels like her connection to a peaceful life is lost, but she holds on to a special talisman that inspires her.\n\n“This is a photo of my grandfather… He’s from Donechchyna, wearing traditional embroidered clothing, handsome and intelligent… When I feel drained, I imagine what he would say about all of this… And then, when I picture it, I get up and do what needs to be done.”\n\nOverall, Ukrainian culture and symbols help the activists maintain morale, even though preserving traditions in occupied conditions is incredibly challenging. The Mavkas mention that they only practise these traditions in family settings, never in public. For Easter, they decorated pysanky, and in winter, they celebrated St. Nicholas Day and Christmas. They do this quietly, as open resistance has disappeared in the occupied territories, unlike in the early days of the Russian invasion. The occupiers suppress any acts of resistance. However, Mavka Two points out that certain habits among people still persist.\n\n&gt;*Pysanky: Traditional Ukrainian Easter eggs decorated with intricate designs using a wax-resist technique.*\n\n“I saw people in the hospital speaking to the staff in Ukrainian. They didn’t even realise they shouldn’t be doing that since it’s their mother tongue. You should have seen how irritated the doctors from Russia were. They even threatened those people. So, we experienced a gentle Ukrainisation, and now we’re facing forced Russification.”\n\n[Mavka's money with the inscriptions \\\\\"Russian banks have no place here.\\\\\" \\(top\\) \\\\\"Crimea is Ukraine.\\\\\" \\(bottom\\). Photo source: “Zla Mavka” telegram channel.](https://preview.redd.it/hx57f6uob55e1.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a50f9d3dbeb6daaed5c1ed5fb3f3feeb093edb99)\n\nThe Russian occupiers are generally enraged by any reference to Ukrainian culture. The Mavkas note that the Russians have come to impose their ways of life while erasing local customs and laws. This includes the letters “ї” and “є” (unique Ukrainian letters absent in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet – ed.), which frankly frighten the invaders, as well as the overall Ukrainian history and identity. Zla Mavka serves as a reminder to the Russians that they are merely temporary visitors and that they will never fully suppress the Ukrainian spirit.\n\n“You have more power in your hands than you think,” Mavka One emphasises. “You realise that every action you take matters; it’s inspiring. Ukrainians are amazing, really! And Ukrainian women are cooler than Marvel superheroes.”\n\nIn their struggle, the Mavkas have seen not only the strengths of Ukrainians but also their striking differences from the Russians. Mavka Three points out that Ukrainians don’t need what is foreign, only what is their own. Mavka One sees no similarities between the two nations.\n\n# “It’s not that we are brothers; we aren’t even distant relatives. They lack innate culture, taste, critical thinking, and internal freedom. They have no sense of self, dignity, or will – and so much more. They have no truth.”\n\nMavka Two adds that what sets Ukrainians apart is their sense of internal freedom.\n\n“It’s an integral part of us. \\[Russians\\] don’t grasp that they can change things; they follow like sheep to the slaughter. We have always been accustomed to changing the hetman when we don’t like them.”\n\n&gt;*Hetman: A historical title for a supreme leader in Ukraine, originally referring to the commander of the Kozak army and later the head of the Ukrainian Kozak state that existed in the 17th and 18th centuries.*\n\nZla Mavka continues its efforts in the occupied territories against all odds, vowing to do so until de-occupation. Specifically, the women aim to show the world that Ukrainian resistance exists and that people in the occupied territories are not welcoming Russia and refuse to live under its rule.\n\n# “We’re trying to tell the world what is really happening here, to speak about Russia’s crimes. We publish diaries from the occupied territories so that the world knows the truth — that we continue to fight for justice here and ask them to keep fighting for us.”\n\n[‘Keep fighting — you are sure to win! God helps you in your fight! For fame and freedom march with you, And right is on your side!’ \\(English translation by John Weir\\).

They encourage other underground groups and movements to stay strong, be cautious, and believe in Ukraine’s victory.\n\n“The best advice we received long ago was, ‘Fight and you will prevail,’” says Mavka One. “Each person chooses their path, doing what they can and what they believe is necessary. Most importantly, we all share one goal — Ukraine!”\n\nMavka Two emphasises that the scariest thing is living under occupation, so Ukrainians must keep going. **“Let those Russian monsters see every day that they can’t break us and that we will never be Russians.”**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1017th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

For example, the older generation, who might not know how to bypass blocks or use VPN, or simply don’t want to risk searching for Ukrainian channels, are left relying on their televisions. And we all know what that means — they’re only exposed to Russian propaganda.”\n\nThe idea to create a newspaper struck Mavka Two during a visit to a friend outside the city. She noticed that her acquaintances were watching Russian news on TV and that they thought that was enough, choosing not to look for any alternative sources of information.\n\n[Zla Mavka’s weekly newspaper. Photo source: “Zla Mavka” telegram channel.](https://preview.redd.it/925t3rfz5r4e1.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0517aa339b956467e100007478ab1a6823ad6064)\n\nNow, the Zla Mavka team puts together a weekly summary of key events happening in Ukraine. They distribute printed copies of the newspaper through mailboxes, leave them by front doors, and drop them in parks, encouraging readers to pass them along to others after reading. The electronic version of the newspaper can also be downloaded from their Telegram bot. Mavka Three recalls instances where people downloaded the newspaper and shared it further via messaging apps. Such actions also bolster the movement:\n\n“Even sharing one newspaper, poster, or sticker is already a small personal victory for someone who manages to do it.”\n\nThe Zla Mavka movement operates without sponsors or funding and typically doesn’t require large budgets. Anyone who wants to join the movement can contribute; if they have a printer at home, they can print posters, newspapers, stickers, or even counterfeit banknotes for their next act. What truly matters for the movement’s functioning is strong morale, Mavka One explains.\n\n“We need motivation, inspiration, and faith in victory above all else. Material concerns aren’t our main focus here. Sure, money is needed, but it’s not the be-all and end-all. What we really need are more eyes and ears. For people to keep resisting, they need to feel that their efforts aren’t in vain. We often notice that the number of activists rises whenever good news comes from Ukraine or the battlefield. People feel inspired and ready to take action again. But it works the other way too — everyone’s reading online, and it’s all too easy to lose motivation.”\n\nThat’s why Mavkas consider supporting other women in the occupied territories another vital aspect of their work. They remind these women that they have someone to turn to, to talk to, and that others share their thoughts and views. Mavka One makes an effort to keep participants from dwelling on their sadness, while Mavka Three adds that even simple conversations often make a real difference.\n\n“This isn’t about persuading anyone to think differently but about providing friendly, mutual psychological support. It’s like chatting with a friend in the evening. That’s the vibe of our Telegram channel – everything is infused with sarcasm and humour.”\n\nMavka Two mentions that the three of them often respond to messages from participants together.\n\n“We’re friends. Even though I’m older than many, they come to me for advice or just to cry quietly when things get tough. Many girls from different cities reach out to me for advice or just to discuss life under occupation. Then \\[the Mavkas\\] come to me, we sit down together, and we start responding to everyone. It’s like an anonymous women’s club. I genuinely hope to meet some of them after liberation; we’ve never seen each other, but it already feels like we’re friends.”\n\nThe Mavkas also noticed how vital it is for women in the occupied territories to feel supported by those in Ukraine or abroad.\n\n“I remember how thrilled they were when they saw photos of women from different countries painting our symbol on their arms! It was truly amazing,” Mavka One recalls. “Lots of Mavkas wrote to us back then, but one message particularly resonated with me: ‘I don’t know how you did it, but thank you. It meant the world to me to see that we haven’t been forgotten, that people are proud of us and keep fighting for us — that gave me the strength to keep fighting.’”\n\n[Zla Mavka's supporters across the world. Photo source: “Zla Mavka” telegram channel.](https://preview.redd.it/lzl5kbm76r4e1.png?width=1160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ac2a9f3ff47e26467293addb5f4e563164f116)\n\nWhat’s truly disheartening, however, is the criticism suggesting Zla Mavka’s actions are insufficient, and the participants could be trying harder. The founders find it strange to read such comments, particularly from those who aren’t in Ukraine. Conducting open resistance in occupied territories is incredibly challenging, as the Russians have installed surveillance cameras throughout the streets and plan to set up facial recognition technology soon. The occupiers check people on the streets, carry out searches, and do everything they can to make life difficult for both activists and ordinary citizens, explains Mavka One.\n\n“You have to consider a lot of factors before even putting up that poster. And that’s precisely why it hurts when fellow Ukrainians write that we’re doing some pointless nonsense. You flinch at every sound, every shadow, or even from your own fear. Sometimes, this fear is valid: someone might peek out from a window (and there are plenty of informers around), a car drives past, or something else happens… Each time you think, ‘This is it, I’m going to get caught…’ But then, as if you’re in a fog, you quickly do what you need to and escape. And even when you’re safe, you don’t feel safe. What if someone saw you? What if there was a camera you missed? What if they find you…?”\n\nLife under occupation imposes severe restrictions, making basic survival the greatest challenge. The Mavkas observe that the longer the occupation drags on, the harder it becomes for people to resist and maintain hope. With restrictions on information, struggles to meet basic needs, and psychological pressure from the Russians, Mavka Two feels that such conditions compel people to better understand and appreciate what they had before.\n\n&gt;\n\nFor the Mavkas, this means one thing: becoming more resourceful, exploring new ways of resistance while staying anonymous, and keeping morale high.\n\n**Fight and you will prevail**\n\nThe co-founders make all decisions about Zla Mavka’s activities, but only if everyone is on board. Other participants who join take responsibility for their own safety and the risks involved. Mavka Three explains that the safety rules are always consistent.\n\n“The orcs (Russians — ed.) will arrest you for a Mavka sticker as easily as for a newspaper. Burning a Russian flag is probably the riskiest act. We carefully discuss who will do it, whether there are any cameras and the best time to carry it out. Plus, we never share the results immediately \\[online\\] to avoid tipping off the enemy.”\n\nFor this reason, the Mavkas try to only document their activities through their own resources, such as a website section called “Mavka Diaries”, their Telegram channel, or partnerships with journalists. They try to avoid keeping any personal records, as Mavka Three explains. “That would be like building a criminal case against yourself in a Russian court.”\n\nThere’s also the psychological pressure. For the Mavkas, it’s mainly the presence of the enemy occupying their homeland. They also endure online harassment, receiving offensive comments and mass sexist threats in their Telegram channel or on enemy platforms. The Russians often try to hack Zla Mavka’s social media accounts, setting up clones of their chatbots or fake movement accounts to communicate with local residents. At the same time, as Mavka One points out, the occupiers try to downplay the movement’s existence.\n\n“They belittle our actions in their public forums, calling us rats or insisting that we don’t exist at all. But seriously, guys, why are you sending the Youth Army to cover up our graffiti if that’s the case? The worst thing for them is to admit that we are here. Because then they have to admit that they don’t have the support they claim in their propaganda. That’s our main mission: we show the world that we exist and that people here are waiting for Ukraine!”\n\nThese obstacles do not diminish the Zla Mavkas’ determination to continue their resistance. The women want to make it clear to the Russians that they haven’t accepted the occupation. As Mavka Two puts it, “Sometimes you wonder if it’s all in vain and they really came to stay. But then you tell yourself, ‘Do your job, and our guys will come.’”\n\n[One of Mavkas in occupied Melitopol.

For the occupiers, it is crucial that people abandon their own national identity in favour of Russia, as this strengthens their hold on the conquered lands. However, Ukrainians in the temporarily occupied territories refuse to accept the “Russian world” and are determined to help the Ukrainian defence forces liberate these areas as soon as possible. One of these resistance groups is known as Zla Mavka (Evil Mavka).\n\nZla Mavka is an all-women resistance movement that uses non-violent methods to fight against the occupiers. It started in Melitopol (a city in southeastern Ukraine that was occupied by Russia in the first days of the full-scale invasion) in early 2023, when open resistance to the Russians became nearly impossible. The members – called mavkas — operate anonymously and don’t know each other. They put up posters and leaflets, spread accurate information to counter Russian propaganda, and do whatever they can to keep the occupiers on edge, never letting them feel secure.\n\nOnly the three co-founders of the movement know one another. For their safety, we cannot reveal their real names; instead, we’ll call them Mavka One, Mavka Two, and Mavka Three. The women shared how the resistance movement began as a joke, how they can easily spot Russians trying to infiltrate it, and what they miss the most while living under occupation.\n\n**From a kitchen joke to a resistance movement**\n\nZla Mavka operates in occupied cities and towns both online via a chatbot-enhanced Telegram\\* channel and on the ground. The movement’s logo features three women, representing the founders: one in traditional Ukrainian clothing, another holding a rolling pin, and the third in modern attire. These images are deliberate — they subvert stereotypical depictions of women, turning them into symbols of female strength.\n\n&gt;\\*While Ukraїner considers Telegram an unsafe platform, it remains one of the few available communication channels in the temporarily occupied territories.\n\nThe co-founders say there’s no heroic story behind the creation of the movement. The main catalyst was the presence of occupiers and Russian flags in their hometown. Each of them had already supported anti-Russia activists in Melitopol before launching their initiative. But as reprisals persisted and resistance went underground, they decided to show the Russians what defiance from Ukrainian women could look like, Mavka One explains.\n\n“\\[We wanted\\] to show that our women are brave and strong, and we will never play nice with them here. Plus, at that time (referring to 2022-2023 — ed.), they were behaving very arrogantly toward our girls, and resistance from women really got under their skin.”\n\n[Photo source: “Zla Mavka” telegram channel.](https://preview.redd.it/5bs7zt03uj4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75ea679cc6326f515f037797dedcc727e93ae29a)\n\nMavka Three recalls that the movement began as a joke in the kitchen, with one of them saying, “Why don’t we start an organisation to resist the Russian occupation?” The idea came from a sense of helplessness and anger.\n\n“At first, it was a kind of resistance out of sheer principle. When you know that the circumstances are stronger, but you still push back.”\n\nThe women opted for a non-violent form of resistance to annoy the Russian occupiers and remind them that they weren’t welcome in Melitopol. When they started planning their activities, the Mavkas never imagined it would evolve into a large women’s movement. For safety reasons, everything began within a small circle of friends. Mavka One recalls that their first project involved distributing leaflets, which also helped them connect with like-minded people.\n\n“We came up with drawings and messages that would really annoy \\[the occupiers\\] and spread them where they would definitely be seen. Then we decided to set up a Telegram channel to show people what we were doing and what was happening here. That’s when things really took off. Women and girls from other occupied cities started reaching out, asking us to send them our leaflets so they could do the same. We didn’t expect to hear from so many. That’s when we realised it was time to get organised and take this seriously, to establish rules, safety measures, and everything else.”\n\nNow, the movement has followers in various Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, stretching from Donechchyna to Crimea. The Mavkas developed a Telegram bot to allow participants to communicate easily with the leaders and receive tasks. This ensures anonymous and secure communication, which, according to Mavka Three, is a top priority.\n\n“We never ask for real names or any information that could reveal someone’s identity. Communication only happens through secure messaging apps. Plus, we constantly remind everyone about cybersecurity: clearing chats, not storing any sensitive information, and so on.”\n\nMavka Two adds that people in the occupied territories have learned to be cautious, as the occupiers sometimes carry out searches, checking mobile phones particularly thoroughly. That’s why the Mavkas advise their activists to use two devices if possible. If that’s not feasible, they recommend not storing anything on the device that the occupiers could use as evidence of underground activities.\n\nThis atmosphere of anonymity could potentially benefit the Russians and their security services who might seek to infiltrate the movement and expose its participants. However, according to Mavka One, they can usually identify these infiltrators quite easily.\n\n“It’s often quite amusing. I don’t know how they were trained, but ‘comrade major’ looks ridiculous trying to pass as a girl! Our rules are set up so that the most he can get from us is a task. So let him go and draw a Ukrainian flag!”\n\nWhat truly hurts the Mavkas is seeing traitors among long-time friends or even family members, says Mavka Two.\n\n“It’s like knowing someone for half your life, only to realise they’d betray you for some perks from the occupiers.”\n\n**Resistance with a sense of humour**\n\n[Mavka's 50-ruble note with the inscription \\\\\"You are in Ukraine. It's not Russia.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ilrkjz1euj4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0139a8bcdcc5121a4142c00504e9a84ce398d78)\n\nThe activists take pride in all their actions, but one of their favourites is “Mavka Money”, an initiative in which they redesigned Russian ruble banknotes by adding images of Mavkas. These banknotes circulated in Melitopol, Berdyansk, Tokmak, Kakhovka, Simferopol, Sevastopol, and Yalta (Russian-occupied cities in the south of Ukraine – ed.). Over time, they were even spotted in the Kuban region of Russia. Mavka Three recalls that they didn’t have to wait long for a reaction from the occupiers.\n\n“The first banknote was amazing. \\[The Russians\\] went wild in their channels and in the comments. Watching their reactions was hilarious. The funniest part was that the discussion only escalated when an English newspaper picked it up. Instead of brushing it off as a minor issue, they inadvertently amplified the very idea they were trying to dismiss.”\n\nMavka One recalls that when they successfully released the first “copy” of a ruble banknote in Melitopol, local pro-Russian channels portrayed it as an attempt to undermine the Russian banking system.\n\n“Just imagine! We released copies of their rubles with the slogan that \\[Russian occupiers\\] are in Ukraine, and they thought we were the fools! We released a 50-ruble note, and they claimed that such a small denomination couldn’t possibly disrupt their banking system or affect the circulation of the ruble. I read it and couldn’t believe my eyes. Our latest joke at their expense ended up being labelled a serious terrorist act.”\n\n[“Mavka’s Kitchen”.

Initially, the women simply distributed posters warning the occupiers to be careful about what they ate or drank. Later, the activists gained access to the kitchen where the Russians dined and added a laxative to their food. They later did the same with homemade alcohol.“When the occupiers went door-to-door asking for moonshine or food, I thought, why not? I know how to cook, and if a bit of laxative ends up in the food, it happens. As for moonshine, that’s a risky business. Maybe I missed something along the way. That’s how the idea for ‘Mavka’s Kitchen’ came about. Everyone loves it.”\n\n**Now, the occupiers in Melitopol often hesitate to eat food they aren’t sure about, even if it’s just fresh fruit or vegetables.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Part two tomorrow!**  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1014th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

    "selftext": "Georgia was Putin’s first victim in Europe when he in 2008 stirred up Russian nationalism in the border regions to counter Georgia’s strengthening ties with Europe and the US. The ensuing war and takeover of Georgian lands was replicated with Russia’s invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014. NO PEACE  RESULTED FROM ANY OF THESE CRIMINAL EVENTS.  Russia has continued to meddle with Georgian politics to stifle any redirection towards the west, and it is a reasonable assumption that Russia will do exactly the same, if they are able to hold on to any Ukrainian lands after a ceasefire.  Georgia and Ukraine both have the right to govern all land within their internationally recognized borders - now is the time to expel Russian troops from both nations!",

Russian cultural figures and media products held a near-monopoly across much of the post-Soviet space. This allowed Russia, with its state-controlled media market, to impose its standards, familiar imagery, and political narratives on countries previously under Soviet control. Amidst Russia’s aggressive cultural expansion, Ukrainian institutions, NGOs, and government agencies – often with limited financial and public backing – faced a serious challenge, which they transformed into a drive for rapid development. The full-scale Russian invasion has further fuelled the growth of Ukraine’s independent cultural sector, where the need to assert, nurture, and safeguard Ukrainian culture has become as crucial as reclaiming occupied territories and defending borders.\n\n**Strengthening institutions for global engagement**\n\nTo strengthen Ukraine’s global presence, the government established the Ukrainian Institute in 2017. This organisation focuses on promoting cultural and scientific cooperation internationally, raising awareness of Ukraine, and introducing foreign audiences to its context. Between 2019 and 2024, the Institute conducted research on global perceptions of Ukraine and Ukrainian culture, as well as an in-depth study on how Ukrainian history is represented in foreign textbooks and media. This research has laid the groundwork for Ukraine’s future international efforts, marking the country’s first targeted policy for developing its global image since gaining independence in 1991.\n\n[First programmes and projects of the Ukrainian Institute. Screenshot from the official website of the organisation.](https://preview.redd.it/swjn879nsc4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1abea77c2c43e55917f5125e780751334cdf24da)\n\nIn the same year, the **Ukrainian Cultural Foundation (UCF)** was established under the Ministry of Culture of Ukraine. The Foundation is renowned for offering grants to support cultural projects, including literature, music, theatre, film, as well as initiatives related to folk art, visual arts, and architecture. It also plays a key role in promoting cultural values, fostering a rediscovery of ethnic identity among Ukrainians, and running cultural and awareness-raising campaigns aimed at elevating cultural standards within society.\n\n[Screenshot from the official website of the Ukrainian Cultural Foundation \\(UCF\\).](https://preview.redd.it/9twru4upsc4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b0994df4c33529abd923c669d661749bee0e1dc)\n\nIn 2016, Ukraine also set up the **Ukrainian Book Institute**, which plays a key role in reviving the popularity of Ukrainian-language literature and supporting local publishers. The Institute develops and implements strategies to grow the Ukrainian book market, supports publishers, encourages the publication of new books, and broadens the range of themes and genres in domestic literature. It also promotes translations of Ukrainian literature into foreign languages, helping to raise awareness of Ukraine and its culture internationally — an effort that has become especially crucial since the full-scale invasion.\n\n[Screenshot from the official website of the Ukrainian Institute of Culture \\(UIC\\).](https://preview.redd.it/4u0qi0cusc4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d5ed35101dbac94114cfe352568ad4a6349681a)\n\n**Revitalising Ukrainian book industry**\n\nCheap, mass-market Russian books were a powerful tool of Russian influence on Ukrainian readers. The need to counter this form of information warfare became even more pressing after Russia’s invasion in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine introduced its first legal restrictions on the import of Russian books, initially focusing on those with anti-Ukrainian content. These publications were actively produced and distributed by Russia to spread propaganda, justify its actions, and assimilate populations in occupied territories. However, right up until the full-scale war, Russian books still held a significant share of the Ukrainian market.\n\nIn June 2022, Ukrainian parliament passed a bill banning the import of all books printed in Russia, Belarus, and the Ukrainian territories currently under Russian occupation, as well as books by authors who were (or have been at any time since 1991) citizens of Russia, with a few exceptions.\n\nIndustry leaders hope that the new legislation will create more space on bookstore shelves for books by Ukrainian publishers. However, the law still has some blind spots, particularly with electronic content, and will require additional resolutions and regulations to be fully effective. As a result, the true impact of these changes, or lack thereof, will only become clear in the future.\n\n[Photo: Anastasia Magazova for DW.](https://preview.redd.it/wr61hfqysc4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e496bf34270781e35f40314b1c22a619c691c1e4)\n\n**Boycotting Russian propaganda films**\n\nIn 2015, Ukrainian lawmakers banned the screening of films and TV series produced in the Russian Federation after 1991. This move was a response to the overwhelming presence of Russian content in Ukraine, as well as the genuine security threat posed by Russia’s use of film to spread anti-Ukrainian propaganda and historical distortions worldwide. Since 2014, the State Film Agency of Ukraine (Derzhkino) has been removing Russian-produced content from cinemas and television. By 2018, 780 films and TV series from Russia, which contained propagandist anti-Ukrainian messages, had been banned.\n\nThe main reasons for the ban were the threat posed by the actors in these films to Ukraine’s national security, as well as the promotion of methods and imagery associated with Russia’s and the USSR’s punitive institutions, which distorted facts and spread falsified historical narratives.\n\nA new wave of opposition to Russian cinema emerged following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Film Academy called for an international boycott of works by Russian directors, urging that their films be excluded from screenings, festivals, and competitions. This call was driven by the ongoing use of art, particularly cinema, by Russia to justify its crimes and spread distorted historical narratives.\n\nFor instance, in September 2024, the Venice Film Festival premiered Russians at War, directed by Russian filmmaker Anastasia Trofimova. The film sparked controversy due to Trofimova’s past work for the Russian state media conglomerate RT, which has been banned in several EU countries and the UK for spreading disinformation and hate speech. She had also filmed in Ukrainian territories under occupation, violating Ukraine’s border laws. The Ukrainian community strongly protested the film’s international screenings, as it portrayed the Russian occupation of Ukraine in an unduly positive light, downplaying Russia’s war crimes.\n\n**Mitigating the impact of Russification**\n\nAlthough the Ukrainian Constitution established Ukrainian as the state language in 1996, in practice, it remained sidelined in many areas of public life due to Soviet-era Russification policies. However, in recent years, Ukrainian has been steadily regaining ground in both public and private spheres, driven by legislative changes and a growing desire among Ukrainians to break free from the Russian influence. This shift has been particularly pronounced since Russia’s full-scale invasion.\n\nOne of the measures used to promote the Ukrainian language in the media has been the introduction of language quotas. This initiative aimed to support domestic producers, who often struggle to compete with foreign content, particularly from Russia. Following the introduction of the relevant law in 2016, a certain percentage of radio and television programming was required to feature content in Ukrainian. As of 1 January 2024, the mandatory minimum for Ukrainian-language content on radio and television broadcasters was set at 90%.\n\nIn 2019, Ukrainian parliament passed the law “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language” to address the legacy of forced Russification. The law ensures the right to receive services in Ukrainian across government institutions, local self-government bodies, education, healthcare, media, culture, commerce, services, and advertising.\n\n**Restricting Russian music in public**\n\nFor similar reasons, in 2022, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law banning the public performance of Russian music. The law prohibits the playing of Russian songs at concerts, clubs, and other venues, as well as their broadcast on radio and television, the airing of Russian music videos and the use of Russian song recordings at public events.\n\n[Collage by the Centre for Countering Disinformation under the National Security and Defence Council.

As part of this effort, Ukrainians are striving for the recognition of artists as Ukrainian, rather than Russian. For example, art historian Oksana Semenik launched a social media campaign encouraging museums around the world to reassess the national identities of artists who have often been mislabelled as Russian.\n\n[The painting “Red Sunset on the Dnipro” by Arkhip Kuindzhi, 1905. It belongs to the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. A sketch of the painting from the Kuindzhi Museum in Mariupol was lost after the city was captured by Russian forces in 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/bmo1ydp6tc4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b89f3ce8baea8d85af7157470aa9fd45018b4df)\n\nIn early 2023, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York began reclassifying the works of artists Ilya Repin, Ivan Aivazovsky, and Arkhip Kuindzhi, recognising them as Ukrainian artists. Previously, the museum had referred to them as Russian artists or artists celebrated in both Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the museum changed the title of a piece by French impressionist Edgar Degas. What was once known as Russian Dancers is now titled Ukrainian Dancers. In March 2023, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam began presenting Kazimir Malevich as a Ukrainian artist.\n\n[The work “The Woodcutter” by Kazimir Malevich from the collection of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, 1912-1913.](https://preview.redd.it/4kz5psp8tc4e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=970a1f6e6e406fa6e4cfaee5da4dad3b1a8a98a1)\n\nUkraine’s path towards territorial integrity, institutional development, and a progressive future is still ongoing. Many of the reforms mentioned have proven effective and have been enshrined in legislation. Others will demonstrate their impact, along with areas needing further refinement, in the future. Despite imperfect results at times, mistakes, and external factors hindering progress, the past decade has been a period of significant change for Ukraine, showcasing the resilience and determination of Ukrainian society.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1013th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Another heavy blow came with the sharp decline in the hryvnia exchange rate, which sparked inflation, capital outflows, and a general downturn in the economy. As of November 2013, the Ukrainian Treasury held just $10 million in its bank account – the lowest amount in the past decade. Despite the turbulence of the last ten years, Ukraine continues to work towards economic recovery and has a number of achievements to show for its efforts.\n\n**Decoupling from Russia’s natural gas**\n\nAfter President Yanukovych fled and Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow once again used energy as a weapon to influence Ukrainian politics, exploiting the country’s heavy reliance on Russian gas. In 2014, Gazprom, the Russian company that monopolises gas extraction and supply, inflated prices and eventually completely cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. This move, sanctioned by the Kremlin, pushed Ukraine to the brink of an energy crisis. However, by diversifying its energy sources and forming new partnerships with suppliers like Slovakia and Poland, Ukraine was able to reroute gas that had previously gone from Russia to the EU, helping its economy to withstand the crisis.\n\nA key step towards energy independence came in 2015, when Ukraine’s national energy company, Naftogaz, brought a high-profile case against Gazprom in the Stockholm Arbitration Court. In a landmark ruling, the court found that Gazprom had breached its contractual obligations for gas supply and ordered the company to pay Ukraine $4.53 billion in compensation.\n\n[Photo: Yves Herman for Reuters.](https://preview.redd.it/sei8netnj54e1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935c8fe96fe63b4ec4e512e0970d3aac8554a0eb)\n\nIn 2016, Ukraine finally renounced all direct procurements of natural gas from Russia. Instead, the country is importing gas from EU countries like Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. Between 2017 and 2018, Ukraine focused on reforming its natural gas market, creating a competitive environment to encourage more suppliers to enter the market.\n\n**Navigating new global markets**\n\nRussia’s military occupation of parts of Ukraine led to the loss of trade relations with those regions and the severing of ties with the terrorist state, compelling Ukraine to shift its focus towards new upstream and downstream markets.\n\nThe signing of the EU Association Agreement in 2014 opened access for Ukraine to the EU market, with its 450 million consumers, making it one of Ukraine’s key partners. However, Ukraine didn’t stop there; it quickly began developing trade relations with countries in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, seeking new opportunities to export its goods.\n\nDue to the high inflation of the Ukrainian currency in 2014, caused by the Russian invasion, imported goods became more expensive, which stimulated the growth of domestic production. At the same time, the government introduced a number of programmes and incentives to support Ukrainian producers, contributing to the increased competitiveness of Ukrainian products on the global market.\n\n[Image source: “Slovo i Dilo” analytical portal](https://preview.redd.it/gatgcp8qj54e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2dade68ef05af7a32b68c05ba8224962af21d0)\n\nIn 2014, Ukraine’s exports totalled $53.9 billion. However, in 2015-2016, due to Russia’s occupation of Crimea and the part of Donechchyna, where the country’s strategically important industries are concentrated, this figure dropped to $38.1 billion and $36.4 billion, respectively. Nevertheless, with successful reforms, exports began to rise again, reaching $47.3 billion in 2018. On the eve of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine primarily exported metals and metal products, plant-based products, as well as machinery, equipment, and mechanisms. Textiles and textile products made up a smaller share of exports.\n\n**Boosting the banking system’s resilience**\n\nSince 2014, 97 banks have been removed from the Ukrainian market due to capital issues, insufficient liquidity, opaque ownership structures, and other reasons. In response, the government took the initiative and launched a comprehensive reform of the banking system to ensure its stability and protect users’ rights.\n\nOne of the key measures was strengthening regulatory policies to enhance the system’s resilience, improve corporate governance in banks, protect depositors’ rights, and combat financial crimes. The new banking law introduced stricter capital requirements, while the National Bank of Ukraine was granted additional tools to oversee financial institutions more effectively.\n\n[Photo source: Press service of the National Bank of Ukraine \\(NBU\\).](https://preview.redd.it/k9cqyapsj54e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e630d4f6ae4d4383287872808c4d8453babd2f12)\n\nIncreasing transparency was another key priority of the reform. The central bank introduced new rules requiring banks to disclose more information about their operations, financial status, and ownership structures. This allowed customers and investors to make more informed decisions and helped improve trust in the banking system.\n\n**Creating a transparent land market**\n\nLand reform began in 2019 with the goal to establish a transparent land market, attract investment, drive economic growth, and create additional jobs.\n\nThe main objective of the reform was to remove the ban on private land ownership, a remnant of the Soviet era when all agricultural land was state-owned. The reform **lifted the ban on the sale of agricultural land** in two stages: from 2021, land could only be bought by individuals, and from 2024, legal entities would also be allowed to purchase land.\n\nThe third stage of the reform aims to open the market to foreign individuals and companies.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1012th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Photo source: Wikipedia.](https://preview.redd.it/9tudjg3jey3e1.png?width=1333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f6fa8052a8023af01c93290d5bfb6ebfd033cdb)\n\n**Defying the grip of (pro-) Russian clergy**\n\nFor centuries, Russia has sought to establish its dominance over Ukrainian lands through a variety of means[,](https://imgur.com/a/JGftFuO) including religious influence. One of the key instruments in this effort has been the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), which, in essence, serves as a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) within Ukraine. Many of its priests and supporters have functioned as conduits for Russian propaganda, advancing narratives that downplay Ukrainian identity and promote hostility towards anything perceived as distinctly Ukrainian. This influence became particularly apparent during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Numerous reports emerged of Moscow-aligned priests collaborating with Russian occupiers and actively spreading Russian propaganda.\n\nA pivotal moment in the push for the recognition of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) came with the call for its autocephaly, or ecclesiastical independence. In 2016, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a resolution appealing to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I, urging him to annul the 1686 decree that had unlawfully placed the Kyiv Metropolia — the oldest Christian church in Eastern Europe, founded in the 10th century — under the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate. As part of this appeal, Ukraine sought the **granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine**, which would enable it to function as an independent entity within the Orthodox Christian world. This would allow the OCU to elect its own leader and manage its own affairs without interference from Moscow.\n\nIn December 2018, Metropolitan Epiphanius was elected Metropolitan of Kyiv and all Ukraine, taking the helm of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU). On 6 January 2019, in a grand ceremony in Istanbul, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew signed the Tomos (decree – ed.) granting autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. This momentous decision set off a wave of church communities across Ukrainian cities and villages shifting from the so-called Moscow Patriarchate to the OCU. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine emphasised that this transition was voluntary, leaving it to the parishioners of each community to choose whether to remain with the Russian church or join the OCU. Since February 2020, 539 parish communities and two cathedrals have come under Ukrainian control. As of February 2022, a further 214 religious communities have chosen to join the OCU, and the movement continues to this day.\n\n&gt;The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople: is the spiritual leader and foremost authority in the Orthodox world, possessing honorary power over the Orthodox churches without exercising direct control over them. His responsibilities include fostering unity among the Orthodox churches, representing Orthodoxy on the international stage, and mediating inter-church disputes.\n\n[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I signs the tomos granting autocephaly to the Orthodox Church in Ukraine.

Law enforcement agencies also began investigating the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) for its compliance with the terms of its lease on the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra — one of Ukraine’s most significant Christian landmarks, dating back to the 11th century. This site had essentially fallen under the control of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) due to a controversial rental agreement arranged by pro-Russian President Yanukovych in 2013. The appointed head of the monastery, Pavlo Lebed, openly supported and propagated Russia’s invasion and occupation of Ukraine, resulting in personal sanctions being imposed on him in 2023.\n\n&gt;The National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine: is a coordinating body under the President of Ukraine, responsible for the development and implementation of policies in the area of national security and defence.\n\nIn 2023, the rental agreement was cancelled, and the Christian shrine was returned to the control of the Ukrainian state and church. On 7 January 2023, when some Orthodox communities celebrate Christmas according to the Julian calendar, the first Christmas service at the Lavra was held by Epiphanius, the head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.\n\nIn 2023, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church implemented a calendar reform and transitioned to new holiday calendars — the Revised Julian and Gregorian, respectively. The old Julian calendar used by the Ukrainian church was 13 days behind the civil calendar, which isolated it from the rest of the Christian world in the observance of major holidays. This move brought Ukrainian believers closer to the international Orthodox community, where the majority of churches had long adopted the new dating system.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1011th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Over the following years, several key bodies were established, including the National Agency for Corruption Prevention (NACP), the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI), the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), and the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC). Additionally, the government introduced online tools to combat corruption: the Prozorro system helps monitor public procurement, while the Unified State Register of Declarations allows access to information about the incomes and assets of individuals holding particularly responsible positions or working in high-risk corruption sectors.\n\n&gt;Prozorro is a Ukrainian public electronic procurement platform that was implemented in 2016 to ensure open access to public procurement (tenders), minimising corruption risks.\n\nDuring the full-scale war, several institutions adjusted their operations to address new realities and priorities. For example, through the National Agency for Corruption Prevention (NACP), the assets of Russians in Ukraine were frozen. Over the two years of the full-scale invasion, court rulings led to the confiscation of assets worth over UAH 5 billion (roughly $135 million – ed.), which were redirected to the state. Meanwhile, the State Bureau of Investigations (SBI) focused its efforts in the newly liberated areas, uncovering officials who had betrayed the country and defected to the enemy.\n\n**Launching E-Government**\n\nSince 2014, Ukraine has made significant strides in developing digital platforms. The country established the Ministry of Digital Transformation, expanded electronic resources, and introduced e-documentation processes. These initiatives have greatly simplified access to a range of public services and enhanced the protection of state information systems.\n\nIn the past four years, Ukraine has climbed from 82nd to 46th place in the Global Government Digitalisation Index. At the 2022 Davos Summit, it was even recognised as Europe’s “digital tiger”.\n\n[Image source: Press service of the Diia portal.](https://preview.redd.it/polvjk4f8d3e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5b0759ea829c3ec47d20b840c5e7d415ccc3306)\n\nOne of the standout projects by the Ministry of Digital Transformation is Diia, a multifunctional portal that has transformed how citizens interact with the State. Beyond offering digital versions of official documents, Diia provides a wide range of services for Ukrainians of all ages, many of which were previously only accessible in person. Since the onset of the full-scale invasion, Diia has been further enhanced to include features such as the ability to access financial compensation and apply for grants to start a business.\n\n&gt;Diia is a Ukrainian e-governance ecosystem that allows citizens to utilise 14 types of digital documents and access over 120 governmental services online. Since its introduction in 2020, the service has been used by over 20 million Ukrainian citizens.\n\n**Empowering communities through decentralisation**\n\nIn April 2014, the Ukrainian government implemented a reform of local self-government and territorial organisation of power — marking the beginning of the creation of amalgamated territorial communities (ATC). This reform aimed to increase the influence of local communities in decision-making at the local level and the distribution of local budgets.\n\nBy 2024, there were 1,439 active ATCs, covering 27,883 settlements. The reform has enabled local governments to operate more independently, giving them greater control over infrastructure development, management of communal property, and budget allocation. For example, in 2023, ATCs donated more than UAH 16 billion (approximately $432 million – ed.) to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\n[Photo: Sofiia Soliar](https://preview.redd.it/bx1zpnmp8d3e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cd64c3e91481b1ff6f1987d1237789ccd574db5)\n\n**Reforming law enforcement system**\n\nUkraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs began its reform in 2014, marking one of the most significant and difficult steps in overhauling the Soviet-era law enforcement system. The reform aimed to transform the Ministry into a modern, transparent, and effective institution in line with European standards. The reform focused on dismantling the Soviet-era militia, the primary law enforcement agency, and replacing it with the National Police, which was founded on principles of the rule of law and community engagement. This reform also included improvements to police training, the introduction of new protocols and procedures, and a stronger focus on protecting human rights, ensuring the force was better equipped to meet the needs of a modern democratic society.\n\n&gt;Militia was a heavily militarised, authoritarian Soviet-period law enforcement system, focused on bureaucracy and procedures, with minimal public oversight of its activities.\n\nMoreover, significant changes were made to the criminal justice system. New legislation was enacted to enhance criminal investigations, combat corruption, and ensure fair trials, strengthening the rule of law and helping Ukraine meet European standards in its judicial processes.\n\n[Photo: Oleksii Karpovych](https://preview.redd.it/nmmfglzx8d3e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25739d69b3fd83bf8ab04d089220c6dcd806b265)\n\n**Combating colonial legacy via decolonisation**\n\nOn 21 May 2015, four decommunisation laws came into effect in Ukraine, which resulted in the deregistration and eventual dissolution of pro-communist parties. This was a crucial step in safeguarding Ukraine’s internal security, as these parties had advocated for cooperation with Russia and promoted hostile narratives.\n\nThe process also saw the gradual removal of monuments to communist figures and the dismantling of communist symbols. Over time, the renaming of streets and settlements was initiated. By 2021, over 51,000 toponyms had been renamed, 991 settlements had changed their names, and around 2,500 monuments and memorials with symbols of the communist totalitarian regime had been dismantled. After 24 February 2022, the process of decommunisation evolved into decolonisation, during which Ukrainians aimed to eliminate the remnants of the “Russian world” from their environment.\n\n&gt;\"Russian World\" is a Russian colonial narrative which promotes the annexation of states neighbouring Russia based on their affiliation with the Russian language, culture, and shared history.\n\n[Photo: Yurii Stefanyak](https://preview.redd.it/hf6av6469d3e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d289238d2172e10bf466dd21951c4c0aef5d3faf)\n\n[Photo: Oleksandr Khomenko.](https://preview.redd.it/9ucwchl79d3e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4b21c4cba0942ac1222957c118d0000ebbd8a3)\n\n[Photo: Oleksandr Khomenko.](https://preview.redd.it/uq1ikky69d3e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=747d236fee57a624b611819d4705a6d1074ff3a2)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1008th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

In his long career, he has reported on the world’s most impactful wars, including those in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Ukraine. These experiences were reflected in his numerous books, such as *The Empire and the Five Kings* and *Israel Alone*. \n\nThis episode explores how decolonisation is related to the ongoing struggle between democratic and authoritarian regimes around the world. Lévy uncovers how the war in Afghanistan set the stage for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, why Ukraine and Israel are coming under fire from far-left populists, and how Russia, Turkey, China, and Iran are shaping a new global anti-democratic axis. \n\n",

    "selftext": "# How Ukraine has Changed in 10 Years of War\n\n**Part Two** **|** *Read Part One* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1gz8coz/728_am_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_1006th/)\n\n[Photo: Viacheslav Ratynskyi.](https://preview.redd.it/rvs1b7r1q53e1.png?width=1333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8b73486564e3c1c987e7e2d77ff93eda717178b)\n\n**Ukraine’s Western integration after 2014**\n\nBefore Ukraine pursued closer ties with the EU[,](https://imgur.com/a/pf1g2VX) it had long been closely aligned with Russia across various sectors. However, over time, the Ukrainian people’s growing aspirations for independence and European integration led to a gradual separation from the Kremlin. This shift was further accelerated after Russia’s initial invasion in 2014.\n\n**Advancing Ukraine-EU relations**\n\nThe process of preparing to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union — the largest international legal document in Ukraine’s history — began in 2007. Over the following years, representatives from both sides held a series of meetings, which successfully concluded in the autumn of 2013. However, just days before the final signing, Ukraine’s government at the time, along with President Viktor Yanukovych, halted the preparation process and announced that the agreement with the EU would not be signed.\n\nThe refusal to sign the agreement sparked mass protests known as the Revolution of Dignity, which began in the autumn of 2013. Initially a peaceful movement in support of Ukraine’s European course, the protests quickly grew into a national demonstration against corruption and abuses of power by the pro-Russian government of the time. This ultimately led to President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing to Russia — a move the Kremlin used as a pretext for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAfter the 2014 Revolution of Dignity and the flight of President Yanukovych, efforts to sign the EU Association Agreement were reignited. In the spring of 2014, Ukraine and the EU signed the political association and economic integration components of the agreement, which were ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament on 16 September. By March 2023, Ukraine had completed 72% of its obligations under the agreement. According to Olha Stefanyshyna, who was Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration at the time, the process of aligning Ukrainian legislation with EU standards has continued, even amidst the full-scale war.\n\n**Securing visa waiver agreements with the EU**\n\nThe visa-free regime with the EU, adopted at the end of 2016, marked the next step in Ukraine’s cooperation with the European Union. It allowed Ukrainians to travel (for up to 90 days) to various EU countries without a visa for short-term visits. Despite the full-scale war in 2024, Ukraine’s foreign passport ranked 32nd in the global Passport Index by Henley &amp; Partners. The country was among the top five nations with the most significant improvements in passport strength over the past decade.\n\n**Verifying EU candidate status**\n\nOn 28 February 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed support for Ukraine’s accession to the EU. In April 2022, the Ukrainian government received a detailed questionnaire from the European Union, which was to be worked on as part of obtaining EU candidate status.\n\nTwo months later, in an official statement by the European Commission, Ukraine was recognised as a potential candidate for EU membership. To maintain this status, a number of specific reforms needed to be implemented, including: the reform of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, judicial, anti-oligarchic, and law enforcement reforms, anti-corruption measures, and the creation of laws on media and national communities. Ukraine continues to implement some of these changes to this day: as of November 2023, experts from the European Commission assessed that 4 out of 7 candidate requirements had been fulfilled.\n\nShortly after the European Commission’s recommendation, on 23 June 2022, the European Parliament passed a resolution supporting Ukraine’s EU candidacy. That same day, the European Council made the final decision to grant Ukraine candidate status. On 14 December 2023, the European Council officially launched negotiations on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union.\n\n**International recognition of the Holodomor**\n\nThe recognition of the Holodomor of 1932–33 — one of the most massive crimes of the Soviet regime — as an act of genocide became particularly urgent after 2014, as it was at this time that the international community began to delve deeper into the Ukrainian context and the underlying causes of the Russo-Ukrainian war. This recognition became a gesture of solidarity and support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia.\n\nThe Holodomor, meaning “death by hunger”, was a man-made famine caused by the Soviet regime’s deliberate policy of collectivisation. According to estimates from Ukraine’s Institute of Demography and Social Studies, the forced confiscation of land and grain in Soviet Ukraine led to the deaths of 3.9 million people, the vast majority of whom were peasants.\n\nThe Soviet leadership channelled the resources gained from collectivisation into industrial development, helping to establish the USSR as one of the world’s largest economies. However, for Ukrainians, the Holodomor meant more than just the loss of economic potential; it devastated traditions and cultural identities, which were lost alongside the lives of countless men, women, and children.\n\nIn 2006, Ukraine officially recognised the Holodomor as a genocide.\n\nIn 2018, the United States Senate passed a resolution unanimously acknowledging it as such. Following the events of 2022, parliaments in Brazil, Ireland, Moldova, Germany, and the Czech Republic also recognised the Holodomor as genocide. In 2023, further recognition came from the parliaments of Bulgaria, Belgium, France, Iceland, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Slovakia, Croatia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, as well as Italy’s Senate. As of November 2023, a total of 30 countries worldwide had recognised the Holodomor as genocide at the parliamentary level.\n\nDuring the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, documenting Russia’s crimes became a top priority to ensure accountability for the aggressor state. In April 2022, Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada adopted the “Declaration on the Commission of Genocide by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, No. 2188-IX”, urging international organisations and the parliaments of other countries to recognise Russia’s actions in the war against Ukraine as genocidal.\n\n[Izium.

In addition, the EU Parliamentary Assembly, along with Estonia, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic, officially designated Russia as a terrorist state. In June 2022, the EU, joined by 43 other countries, issued a Joint Statement supporting Ukraine’s case against Russia at the UN International Court of Justice under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\n\n[Izium.

At the Brussels summit in June 2021, NATO leaders reaffirmed their decision to recognise Ukraine as a US Major Non-NATO Ally. On 30 September 2022, amid the ongoing full-scale war, Ukraine formally submitted an application for an expedited path to NATO membership.\n\nTo enhance cooperation between Ukraine and NATO, particularly in cybersecurity, intelligence sharing, defence reform, and military training, the NATO-Ukraine Council (NUC) was established. This body facilitates political dialogue and coordinates the reforms required for Ukraine’s eventual NATO membership.\n\n[Vilnius NATO Summit 2023.

This alliance, consisting of NATO member states and its partner nations, coordinates the ongoing donation of military aid through monthly meetings. The first meeting was held on 26 April 2022 at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the largest US Air Base in Europe. Since then, the Ramstein Group has become a key platform for aligning international support. This assistance has been crucial in halting the Russian advance and driving them back. By April 2024, representatives from 50 countries had pledged a total of $95 billion in support.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1007th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

That same year, Russia annexed Crimea and launched a war in the east of Ukraine. For more than a decade, Ukraine has been resisting Russian aggression in its many forms. At the outset of the war, Ukraine was in a deeply challenging political, economic, and social condition, and likely appeared an easy target for the aggressor. Despite enduring continuous conflict with a powerful enemy, the nation has managed to preserve its sovereignty, demonstrate resilience in the face of adversity, and gain invaluable experience in reclaiming its territory.**\n\nTen years ago, the vision for Ukraine’s future was vastly different from what it is today. Many of Ukraine’s politicians held pro-Russian views, with their decision-making often shaped by the country’s reliance on the Russian Federation. At that time, most Ukrainians were only beginning to rediscover their national identity and forge a collective sense of purpose, which involved a deeper understanding of the importance of language and culture. Ukrainians were grappling with the legacy of their coexistence with the empire and its lasting influence on their collective consciousness.\n\n[Photo: Viacheslav Ratynskyi](https://preview.redd.it/joifksiyjy2e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e15834d4bd1a189d52d93d2cdbeefdbaaeff791d)\n\nIn addition to facing external challenges, Ukraine has implemented a series of reforms and fostered cooperation across various sectors over the past ten years. The pace, focus, and quality of these actions may still be open to debate, but during this difficult period, the country has undergone significant changes. In recent years, the state has strengthened its sovereignty in the eyes of the international community and gained support from foreign partners. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s economy, politics, culture, and military have finally rid themselves of Russian influence. In this piece, we revisit the key state and societal changes from 2014 to February 2024.\n\n[Photo: Viacheslav Ratynskyi](https://preview.redd.it/vv7bl7puiy2e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b29320bc214463b6802a7882458b54268bb585f)\n\n**How the Ukrainian army has been reforming under fire**\n\nA reformed and more powerful Ukrainian army is one of the key achievements of the past decade. When you are neighbouring a terrorist state, your defence capabilities are crucial for both survival and reform. Since 2014, the Ukrainian Army has undergone one of the most dramatic transformations in its modern history, both in terms of size and quality.\n\nIn 2013, a number of military experts backed up by servicemen pointed out weaknesses in the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU), including a lack of financing, a legacy of Soviet standards, an urgent need to update technologies, and insufficient social support for the soldiers. Russia’s military occupation of Ukraine’s territory, where they seized weapons, military equipment, and other resources for their further advancement in the war, also undermined the capacity of the Ukrainian army.\n\nUnder these dire circumstances, the Ukrainian army managed to muster its strength, with some people responding to the draft call while others volunteered to become soldiers. Still, there was another group who, working as volunteers, took it upon themselves to supply the army with food, arms, equipment and camouflage nets. Along with local charitable initiatives and fundraisers, organisations and funds arose to support the military systematically. Those were the likes of Come Back Alive, Army SOS, Motohelp, Zgraya and others. The experience gained back then became an important asset after the Russian Federation launched a full-scale war in 2022. By that moment, Ukrainians had gained understanding of how to set up an aid system, charitable organisations had grown their own communities, and the culture of donations and charitable work scaled up.\n\n[Photo: Karina Piliuhina](https://preview.redd.it/sxja7qbxiy2e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27b48bd2e56d31d981a209d5b12ecaf14202c57d)\n\nThe transformative change of the Ukrainian Defence Forces began with military reform in 2014. The reform aimed to break away from the Soviet legacy, enhance the country’s defence by adopting NATO principles and standards, and improve the efficiency of planning and resource management systems.\n\n**Introducing NATO standards to military training**\n\nAfter proclaiming its independence in 1991, Ukraine has participated in numerous international drills. Since 2014, the country has significantly increased its joint military exercises with NATO membering states, including the USA, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Italy, and others. Among these, Operation Orbital stands out for its scale and the number of troops involved, with British instructors training over 22,000 Ukrainian servicemen between 2014 and 2022. Despite the full-scale invasion, in the summer of 2022, Operation Orbital was relocated to the UK to continue the training.\n\nFollowing the British instructors’ example, military personnel from countries like New Zealand, the Netherlands, Canada, and others also moved their training operations for Ukrainian soldiers. Operation Unifier, which will continue until 2026, involves the Canadian Armed Forces running boot camps for Ukrainian troops. This operation makes up a crucial part of an international joint effort aimed at reforming the Ukrainian army.\n\n[Photo: Valentyn Kuzan](https://preview.redd.it/qmdkv2uziy2e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=835788322981adba3e589a566e50149f6c64cd76)\n\n**Building a stronger Ukrainian army**\n\nSince 2004, the Ukrainian army has consisted of three main branches: the Ground Forces, the Air Force, and the Navy. The most recent reforms introduced several additional branches, including the Special Operations Forces, the Highly Mobile Air Assault Forces (rebranded as the Air Assault Forces in November 2017), and the Territorial Defence Forces.\n\nAdditionally, nearly two dozen combat brigades were established, alongside new regiments, battalions, and units for operational, combat, rear, and technical support. The number of troops grew rapidly to 250,000 before the full-scale invasion, and surged to 700,000 after February 2022. As of January 2024, according to an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the German broadcaster ARD, the Ukrainian army had expanded to 880,000 soldiers, including both men and women.\n\nCompared to 2014, the number of women in the Ukrainian army has also risen significantly. According to the Personnel Centre of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, by October 2023, the number of female soldiers in combat positions had also increased.\n\n[Photo: Mykyta Zavilinskyi](https://preview.redd.it/bvf75op1jy2e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6208d90a9f81e80fa1aa4eb3e00dd25ea7f30fb6)\n\n**Boosting domestic arms manufacturing**\n\nOver the past decade, Ukraine has developed and produced a variety of new weapons and equipment, which have been used by its forces alongside foreign supplies. Some examples that have been made public are listed below.\n\nIn 2009, the Ukrainian company Research and Manufacturing Association PRACTICA began producing the Kozak armoured personnel carrier, with several models available. This vehicle has been deployed to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, and the State Border Guard Service. Known for its high mobility, the Kozak is equipped with armour capable of withstanding 7.62 calibre bullets. Additionally, it can be outfitted with a variety of weapons, enhancing its versatility in combat.\n\nThe Leleka-100, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by the Ukrainian company Derivo, comes in several modifications. It is valued for its compactness, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency in combat situations. The Leleka-100 provides critical reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities.\n\n[Photo: Volodymyr Pashchuk for the Come Back Alive Foundation](https://preview.redd.it/astyctu3jy2e1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2996ccb18838a97ceb46475eec1e6dfdbe483d45)\n\nThe Ukrainian self-propelled artillery system (SPG) “Bohdana” was designed for a 155mm calibre, in line with NATO standards. The first prototype was unveiled on 14 July 2018. “Bohdana” saw its combat debut during the liberation of Zmiinyi Island in the summer of 2022. Alongside artillery provided by Western partners, it was used to fire on enemy positions. In early 2023, Ukraine secured funding for the serial production of updated models of the “Bohdana”.\n\n**How allied nations are supporting Ukraine’s military**\n\nInnovations and changes in combat tactics have driven the need for modern weapons. In 2018, the USA sold 37 Javelin launchers and 200 missiles to Ukraine, followed by another delivery in 2019 of 10 more launchers and 150 missiles.\n\nAs the full-scale war unfolded, the Ukrainian Armed Forces (AFU) increasingly relied on Javelins, supplied by the allies. In addition, the Swedish-British NLAW anti-tank guided missile systems and man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) such as the FIM-92 Stinger saw high demand. As the war progressed, Ukraine’s requirements expanded to include artillery and armoured vehicles. In May 2022, the USA, Canada, and Australia supplied the AFU with approximately 100 M777 howitzers, a critical contribution that helped Ukrainian forces successfully repel Russian advances in the east of the country.\n\nAnother significant delivery during the full-scale war was the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which enabled the Ukrainian forces to target large concentrations of Russian troops and ammunition depots, even in the rear areas of the frontline. This system provided the ability to strike with precision at greater distances, greatly enhancing Ukraine’s offensive capabilities. By July 2023, Ukraine had also received dozens of Leopard tanks in various modifications from its allies. These tanks are renowned for their superior armour, manoeuvrability, and advanced fire control systems.\n\nIn addition to the equipment used for striking Russian positions, Ukraine was supplied with air defence systems to counter aerial attacks: the NASAMS, IRIS-T, and Patriot missile systems successfully intercepted cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missiles, which was unprecedented in terms of the confrontation between Russian and Western weaponry. These deliveries significantly strengthened Ukraine’s air defence forces (PVO), which, before the full-scale invasion, could intercept no more than 18% of incoming cruise missiles\n\n**Join us next time for Part 2: Western Integration after 2014.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1006th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦  \n",

Some of the books are translated to English, though!  I've also tried to include more than one Ukrainian bookstore that does international shipping so you can browse around and potentially find other selections that may interest you or someone special.\n\n**Disclaimer:** We are not affiliated with any of the companies that appear here.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Install a translation extension for your browser of choice, as not every shop has a built-in English option, but I did make sure that they all function with a translation extension and that they do international shipping.\n\nFind Part 1 of the guide [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1gtwkqp/day_999_the_rukraine_holiday_gift_guide_2024_pt_1/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Books 1](https://preview.redd.it/wtk2agka9r2e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1258631e28401f63e6ddf3ef5bca10d0d2734012)\n\n* Top: **Brave to Bring the Light**, available at [Book Lion](https://booklion.lviv.ua/en/smilyvi-nesty-svitlo/)\n   * 30 Ukrainian photographers record of the energy crisis due to the destruction of Ukrainian infrastructure facilities by the russian military.\n* Bottom: **How We Walk Through the Fire**, available in English at [Ukrainian Pages](https://ukrainian-pages.com/en/products/how-we-walk-through-the-fire-1)\n   * A unique collection of 155 (in reference to 155mm artillery shells) of the most powerful documentary photographs from Ukraine's leading photographers, supplemented by texts written by prominent writers and public figures.

Sadly, this Ukrainian visionary and influential member of the \"Sixtiers\" movement of artists during soviet occupation died under russian federation occupation in Bucha in 2022.\n   * This 2023 book, lovingly printed in vibrant colors, is the only publication of her vital work.\n* Bottom: **All Shades of Mariupol Mosaics**, available at [Book Lion](https://booklion.lviv.ua/en/usi-vidtinky-mariupolskykh-mozaik/).\n   * In 2020, Mariupol art critic Oleksandr Chernov and journalist Stanislav Ivanov published this book, recording information about 26 mosaics that could still be seen on the walls of the city's buildings at that time.  Now in 2024 it has been reprinted – mainly as a memory and preservation of this cultural information which has either already been destroyed by russian genocide or is in the process of suffering that fate.\n   * You can read about some of the damaged cultural heritage of Ukrainian murals of Mariupol, and witness an example of their destruction, in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/18te4oe/758_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_674th/). \n\n[Books 4](https://preview.redd.it/ii2pjfka9r2e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3817b7c8e5b490b23cee2be8c687e6fce0f4dfeb)\n\n* Top: **Oleksandr Dubovyk: The Signs**, available at [Book Ye](https://book-ye.com.ua/catalog/biohrafiyi-ta-memuary/alexander-dubovik-the-signs/).\n   * This book contains more than four decades of works by the artist - we wrote a sunrise post about him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1f4jvb0/610_am_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_919th/-) \\- an ingenious icon and a true iconoclast of the 1960s, who emerged from that difficult period with a practice that is still influential and relevant today.\n* Bottom: **Vasyl Krychevskyi: Ornament Compositions**, available at [Book Ye](https://book-ye.com.ua/catalog/khudozhni-albomy/vasyl-krychevskyj-ornamentni-kompozytsiyi-vasyl-krychevskyi-ornament-compositions/).\n   * Vasyl was an incredible graphic designer whose work we wrote about in the past [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/10pn8aw/735_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_342nd_day_of_the/).  You might remember him as the designer of the gorgeous artwork adorning the [Poltava Museum of Local Lore](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1g3z1cs/721_am_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_965th/).\n   * This book presents 200 samples of his ornamental design work: timeless, bold, and still influential. \n\n[Books 5](https://preview.redd.it/nuxh1fka9r2e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40bca9ff7525ead5e4646d07602884f67a734c46)\n\n* Top: **The Authentic Ukrainian Kitchen: Recipes from a Native Chef**, available in a lot of places.\n   * This 2024 book (in English!) by Ukrainian *C*hef Yevhen Klopotenko makes a fantastic gift!  If you're not familiar with this fellow, check out [this writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/12rez49/557_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_420th/the) along with the AMA he did on r/Ukraine last year [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/12zsd1y/im_ievgen_klopotenko_chef_from_ukraine_i_made_a/).\n   * We didn't include a link because this book is available in your local bookstore, or from its publisher Hachette, or from your nearest transnational corporate online distribution network of choice.  The ISBN is 9780316559393.\n* Bottom: **Treasures of Ukraine: A Nation's Cultural Heritage**, available in a lot of places.\n   * This is a great survey of Ukrainian cultural artifacts from the times of Scythians and Kyivan Rus to today, presented by Ukrainian writers and scholars in the context of the threat of destruction by the russian federation.  It has 220 different images printed nicely in a big coffee table book, great for someone who is new to Ukrainian culture but is a curious reader who wants to learn more!\n   * It too is available in a lot of places - maybe ask for it at your local bookshop.  The ISBN is 0500026033. \n\n[Books 6](https://preview.redd.it/b5d7seka9r2e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c2ab0413a4a749206a640c14d49128ffd0d643)\n\n* Top: **Pokuttia Embroidered Shirts,** available (Presale, shipping in December) from [Book Lion](https://booklion.lviv.ua/en/vyshyti-sorochky-pokuttia-peredprodazh/).\n   * Calling all embroidery fans!  This is the first scientific study of the collection of Pokuttia region embroidered shirts from the collections of the Andrey Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv.  It features high quality close up images forming a catalog of shirts from different areas of the region, along with analysis of form and design.\n* Bottom: **Dr. Leonardo’s Journey to Sloboda Switzerland with His Future Lover, the Beautiful Alcesta**, available from [Harvard University Press](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674291959).\n   * Maik Johansen was a prominent Ukrainian modernist writer who was executed by russians in 1937.  He thus became a tragic member of the entire generation - *thousands* of Ukrainian intellectuals - murdered by russians known as the 'Executed Renaissance.'\n   * We wrote about Maik Johansen in [this sunrise post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/u08wli/615_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_45th_day_of_the/).\n   * This 2024 printing is the first English translation of his witty and exuberant novel, considered one of the brightest achievements of the Ukrainian modernist movement.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Let's Wrap it Up!\n\n[Protect A Volunteer Wrapping Paper](https://preview.redd.it/2yy95hka9r2e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01517bb0d524bb23284a81d321df0da842342866)\n\nOne of my favorite things is to wrap books, there's something really satisfying about that.  This year, you could order up some Protect A Volunteer paper that will not only help you do that, but you'll also be donating to a good cause and perhaps spark some interesting conversations :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Please let me know if there are any gift themes you'd like to see in upcoming installments!**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1005th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

    "selftext": "18% of Ukraine is currently under occupation by the russian federation.  That's a big area to be sure, given Ukraine's size, but it required a decade for the invader to take it.\n\nThis area of Ukraine is larger than countries like Ireland or Austria or South Korea; it's about the same size as the American states of New York or Pennsylvania.  \n\nHow could one quantify how much culture fits inside those places?  Could their residents measure how many memories come rushing back - impressions left by the most cherished moments of life that happened there?\n\nI worry that some people refuse to recognize that there is more to occupied Ukraine than destroyed cities and kilometers of burned land on a map.  Nature, of breathtaking magnificence, lives in this land too, and many places that deeply resonate with the most essential elements of history and culture going back centuries and millennia.  Most importantly, while millions of innocent people were able to escape russian terror, there are still an estimated 5 million Ukrainians who suffer under a brutal totalitarian system.\n\nAnd it is not only the living who deserve justice.  Within the very soil of these territories are fresh mass graves which can be witnessed only at a distance... via satellite.  While there is a massive body of evidence yet to be collected about the genocide of Ukrainians in the 21st century, the dark earth of these places also contain as-yet-undocumented evidence of Holodomor, soviet executions, and the deportation of the Crimean Tatars.  Under russian control, these would continue to fade away - concealed from the world, just as they were decades ago.\n\nAnd some say Ukraine should just... forget?\n\n\n\n* **Mariupol**\n   * [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/yxfmny/715_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_267th_day_of/) | [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/yyagn0/717_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_268th_day_of/)\n   * [Petrykivka Churches of **Mariupol**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/15hnn03/529_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_527th/)\n   * [The Art Train to **Mariupol**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/15v3ll4/552_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_542nd/)\n   * [The **Mariupol** Drama Theater](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1biabq9/602_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_755th/)\n* [**Kreminna**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/105f5cl/758_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_318th_day_of_the/)\n* [**Askania-Nova** Nature Reserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1bdgfrv/615_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_749th/)\n   * [Askania-Nova, Lake Lemuria, Oleshky Sands](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/u0y3cs/613_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_47th_day_of_the/)\n* [**Melitopol**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/124azyb/644_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_398th/), city of honey and **Kamiana Mohyla**, one of the most impressive and important ancient sites in Ukraine\n* **Bakhmut**, the heroic destroyed city\n   * [Part I](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/z7icfq/734_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_279th_day_of/) | [Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/z9dylw/736_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_281st_day_of/)\n* Avdiivka\n   * [The History and People of **Avdiivka**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/18b22es/733_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_650th/)\n   * [Culture in **Avdiivka**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/18bu5nm/733_eet_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_651st/)\n* [**Kramatorsk**, a frontline city](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/14lrgpx/449_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_491st/)\n* **Huliaipole**, a city on the frontline.

I just hope you guys get all the support you can get. Hopefully the NATO countries can step up their efforts and also allow free use of all weapons against all targets and locations from and in ruzzia. putin must be stopped, this can't go on.\n\nMay he regret his decision to attack.

If you're like me, it's way early to be thinking about the holidays already.  But this year we're starting off a little early to account for shipping times better than in previous years.  And this time, the guide will be broken into a few parts.  Each post we'll be giving a special highlight to one Ukrainian business, along with a handful of other categories.  Future installments of this guide will focus on different themes - for instance Books, Kids' Stuff, and items that can support the troops.\n\nWhile the items below are just a handful that we thought might catch someone's eye as a good holiday gift, we're trying to raise awareness of Ukrainian companies rather than individual items.  Take a look around their shops...  Ukrainian small businesses can really use the help this year!\n\n**Disclaimer:** We are not affiliated with any of the companies that appear here.\n\n**Pro Tip:**  Install a translation extension for your browser of choice, as not every shop has a built-in English option, but I did make sure that they all function with a translation extension and that they do international shipping.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Highlight: Ukrainian Beasts Unleashed\n\n[Ukrainian Beasts Unleashed](https://preview.redd.it/m83lluch4l1e1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1dbc4d8bd2820f720e222b9f44b1b8dc9e57d73)\n\n[https://ukrainianbeasts.com/](https://ukrainianbeasts.com/)\n\nThis group makes t-shirts featuring the art of one of the most culturally resonant Ukrainian folk artists, Maria Prymachenko.

While the Russian army is unsuccessfully trying to ‘liberate’ Ukraine from its identity and independence by destroying churches and museums, Prymachenko's ‘liberated’ beasts expand their habitat range wildly and worldwidely.

Since the 1960s, the USSR relied on disinformation and proxy groups to destabilise the West while fueling conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. Notably, the Kremlin backed terrorist factions, including parts of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which carried out numerous hijackings and bombings in the ’60s and ’70s.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d2tl9zij7zd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc4144a1aaf7f31109c539bb9982531f6155e71f\n\nModern Russia actively provides military support to some of the world’s most notorious regimes, such as those in Syria and Iran, engages in oil smuggling schemes, and helps internationally recognised terrorist groups and criminals evade sanctions.\n\nDespite warnings from military experts, intellectuals, politicians, and intelligence agencies about a new “axis of evil” uniting Russia, Iran, North Korea, China, and Islamist organisations, much of the world continues to turn a blind eye, treating these threats as someone else’s problem. History seems to be repeating itself, with all the signs of an aggressive coalition poised to challenge the democratic world emerging, yet the response remains one of appeasement.\n\n**North Korean troops and weapons in Ukraine**\n\nSouth Korea’s spy agency has recently confirmed that North Korea is sending troops to fight in Ukraine. According to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Directorate (GUR), nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops are currently training in eastern Russia to join the attacks against Ukrainians. The recent reports state that North Korean troops are already beginning to desert their positions.\n\n\\[Update: since this article was published, North Korean troops have entered combat with Ukrainian soldiers\\]\n\n[Photo сredit: Uwe Brodrecht, Wikipedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/12fzohuti7zd1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54dbca83be0e3ca22fea36af1c38d1c7dd6bc6da)\n\nAdditionally, North Korea has been supplying Russia with artillery shells and other military equipment, solidifying their growing partnership. North Korea has also publicly expressed strong support for Russia’s crimes in Ukraine, further deepening the alliance between the two countries.\n\n**Russia and Iran’s military cooperation**\n\nRussia and Iran have long been close allies, coordinating with terrorist groups in the Middle East. In 2022, their partnership tightened when Iran started supplying Russia with artillery shells, tank ammunition, and Shahed drones[,](https://imgur.com/a/CS2JHtk) which almost daily target Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Recently, this support has escalated to include more lethal ballistic missiles.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, former acting director general of Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs, Shay Har-Zvi, stated that Russia is expected to supply Iran with fighter jets and advanced air defence systems. Moscow is also assisting Iran in cyber warfare, intelligence sharing, and launching spy satellites.\n\n**The partnership between Bashar al-Assad and Russia**\n\nIn 2015, Russia invaded Syria and provided crucial support to Assad’s and Iranian-backed ground forces, enabling the Syrian dictator to regain significant territorial control and helping solidify his hold on power. For nearly a decade, Russia and Assad have been committing atrocities against civilians, yet these crimes have been underreported and even normalised.\n\n**Russia’s assistance to Hezbollah and Hamas**\n\nRussia has been involved in fighting alongside Iranian-backed Hezbollah and is allegedly providing military support to Hamas. Numerous high-level meetings between Kremlin officials and both groups have been reported.\n\nWhile Russia’s role in the October 7 attack on Israel is still disputed, The Washington Post and other sources reported that Hamas received millions of dollars through a Moscow-based cryptocurrency exchange, Garantex, before the attacks. This funding may have played a significant role in facilitating the group’s operations, as cryptocurrencies have been a known channel for bypassing sanctions and financing terror groups.\n\n**The role of Belarus in the war against Ukraine**\n\nIn the initial phase of the full-scale war in 2022, Russian troops launched their invasion of northern Ukraine, including the assault on Kyiv, from Belarusian soil. Belarus also actively supports Russia’s war against Ukraine by facilitating forcible deportations, hosting Russian nuclear weapons, and allowing missile launches from its territory.\n\nWhile Belarus has not officially deployed its own troops into Ukraine, it has offered logistical support to Russian forces, including repair and resupply efforts for military equipment. This logistical assistance has helped sustain Russia’s prolonged war effort.\n\n**How China helps Russia**\n\nOne significant way China aids Russia is by supplying drones and a variety of military equipment categorised as non-lethal gear, including medical kits, meal kits, and body armour. China also helps Russia evade sanctions by granting access to its financial systems, providing critical technology, and increasing trade. These actions bolster Russia’s war capabilities, allowing it to continue its attacks on Ukraine.\n\nChina has also provided Russia with diplomatic cover on the global stage. It has not condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine and has consistently opposed Western sanctions against Russia. In key international forums, such as the United Nations, China has either abstained from resolutions condemning Russia or voiced opposition to measures aimed at isolating Moscow.\n\n[Photo: Global Taiwan Institute \\/ Express Tribune, July 15, 2020](https://preview.redd.it/2lxa99cfj7zd1.png?width=1294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d07c3e5887f75604840eb261757f0f119608a5b8)\n\n**The primary duty of any government is to ensure the security of its citizens. Even if voters aren’t demanding stronger defence measures, it remains the responsibility of leaders to protect the nation against hybrid or direct attacks.**\n\n**Ignoring the threats posed by Russia and its allies will provide neither security nor peace.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe are **Ukraïner**, a non-profit media aimed at advocating for the authentic Ukraine - and unexpected geographical discoveries and multiculturalism.\n\n**This article was first published on October 28th, 2024.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 987th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

The threat of russian capturjng Kyiv was gone in April 2022. \n\nWhen our country will be forced to freeze this conflict again, leaving hundreds of thousands Ukrainians under russian occupation, with regions in ruins, countless of cities and villages already destroyed and countless more will be destoyed, because US can't be bothered to provide any meaningful amount of military equipment, US will declare it to be victory, because \"there will be strong independent Ukraine\" and US doesn't give a shit how many will die. And it all suddenly makes sense. After that US will cut military aid to Ukraine even more and let russia prepare for new in invasion and will do nothing to stop it. Like it did in 2014 and 2022.\n\n I believe US wanted to help in 2022 and wanted to help with counteroffensive but they dragged their feet on any type of equipment for too long to deliver too little, that counteroffensive failed and from there the situation for our country counties to from bad to worse.\n\nIt shouldn't been like that, the war could have been over by now.\n\nWhy? Look how much % of GDP major Ukrainian allies commit to arming Ukraine and how much money goes to help Ukraine annually. Spoiler: it's almost nothing. It's like 0,1% at best countries like Germany and Great Britain. France that promised to allocate 3bln on military aid which is 0,13% of GDP on fighting new fascist genocidal invasion for 2024 cut it to 2bln. The same 2bln that France spend on military aid to Ukraine in two years prior. Which means 1bln per year from a superpower like France.\n\nUS that planned military aid to Ukraine in Presidential Draw Down Authority for 2024-2025 is slightly below 8bln (that aid that acually arrives to Ukraine) and then you look at Mordor that plans to spend for next year alone 140bln on the war.

They went through different phases of modernisation. Just like the Leopard 2 from 1978 is not the same as the Leopard 2 from today.\n\nThe difference is a lot of Leopard 1 can be given away this is not the case with the Leopard 2. There are not many tank battles happening in Ukraine anyway and given the muddy terrain you might even be better off with a tank that is 20 tonnes less.\n\nIt is more mobile than any other tank on the battlefield in Ukraine, it has a big gun with nightvision and a perfect stabilisation.\n\nBasically a light MBT, a concept the US just recently adopted again with their M10 Booker as infantry support vehicle.\n\nAnd then it also is a simple numbers game. For example replacing those 18 Leopard 2 tanks Germany sent to Ukraine cost Germany 525 million €. This is not sustainable especially since Germany has a debt brake written in its constitution. So the government needs to try an squeeze out the most bang for the buck. Nothing Scholz can do about it. The debt brake was confirmed by the highest court and it is actually the (FDP) and the opposition (CDU) who blocked a reform so we can spent more money. \n\nAnd really looking at how most vehicles get lost in Ukraine it doesn't matter much which tank you are in. Most of the time it is mine or drone damage rendering the tank useless and the disembarked crews later on being ended by drones.  \n\nDrone countermeasure, air superiority and no senseless charges at enemy lines would be much more important than the discussion about the tank model given. This also shows looking at the list of Oryx.\n\n16 M1A1, 2 Challenger 2 and 41 Leopard 2 lost. While on the other hand only 5 Leopard 1 so far were confirmed to be lost.\nSo really i don't know were you get your conclusion from that the Leopard 1 is so much worse for Ukraine. So far we are not seeing this in the numbers.",

This might be true in a sense but Russia is not just going to leave Eastern Ukraine like they did Afghanistan.  Strategically, Ukraine would need to start sending missiles to Moscow.  Ukraine is going to have to take the fight to Moscow locally if they want to keep their country.  What does Russia care if they throw their soldiers and military equipment into a meat grinder on Ukraines soil.  This is a war of public opinion in Russia and sadly there is no incentive NATO or the west can leverage that will stop it.

US intelligence was the only one saying it was coming for months, Europe and Ukraine as well didn’t believe them and those that did thought they were blowing it out of proportion of what was coming down the pipe.\n\nThat is not quite true. At first, in addition to the American intelligence services, others also warned of the invasion, such as the British. While others, such as the Germans, were completely mistaken.\n\nThen it is also not true that the warnings were not taken seriously. Selenskyj has already said that he communicated in a certain way in order not to spread panic, while behind the scene the Ukrainian army has actually prepared for this invasion. He also asked the western leaders to implement sanctions immediately and not to wait for the start of the invasion. European leaders have also traveled to Moscow to somehow prevent the invasion.\n\n&gt;As for the US having no interest in Ukraine, we’ve been ramping up the type of military aid provided to Ukraine prepare since 2014 after everybody in the west did practically nothing about Russia invading Crimea.\n\nBut the US didn't do that much. It may be that 90% of the military aid came from the US, but this aid was only marginal overall. It certainly helped a little, but it wasn't substantial. And it doesn't seem to have impressed Putin either, at least not as much as the nuclear warheads would have done that the Ukrainians had to give to the Russians under pressure from the US.\n\nAnd it took several years after the war began in 2014 for Ukraine to receive a few lethal weapons systems from the United States.\n\nHowever, despite all the help before 2022, everyone still assumed that Ukraine would only survive for a few days given Russia's superior power. And yet nothing significant was done to prevent the full scale invasion. On the contrary, the West was prepared to leave Ukraine to the Russians and possibly react with a few sanctions. \n\nAnd these complete misjudgments about the Russians and also the Ukrainians are the problem. \n\nNow someone who claims to be able to end the war in 24 hours could become President of the USA. Again, a completely naive, unrealistic assessment of the situation. One has to despair in the face of all this incompetence.",

But by involving North Korea in the Ukraine invasion, Kim has made Ukraine South Korea's business.  By draining North Korea's military assets in order to support Putin, Kim has eroded the detente that his country has enjoyed for so long.\n\nThe absolute best case for Kim and Putin here is that South Korea supports Ukraine directly and facilitates the surrender and defection of Korea's forces in the Ukrainian theater.  That's their best case.\n\nWorst case is that South Korea reacts to North Korea becoming conventionally hollowed out while gaining the potential from Russia for a near-term nuclear escalation by drawing the obvious conclusion that now is the best time to settle their differences once and for all, while they still have a chance to.\n\nI have no idea what the threat threshold is for South Korea at which point it becomes a better idea for them to strike across the border at North Korea missile sites than to preserve their existing detente.  But there is a threshold there somewhere.  And Kim has been induced to push it.\n\nPersonally I would not bet against Putin's folly in Ukraine ultimately leading to the end of the Korean War.\n\nIf nothing else, North Korea already had a formidable opponent in the Korean NIS.

    "selftext": " AI drones change the battle in Ukraine: 'No other choice' Julius Moorman economics editor During World War II, a kamikaze attack meant that both a fighter plane and a pilot were sacrificed. Nowadays, drones can carry out such attacks for a few hundred euros, while the operator remains at a safe distance. In the war in Ukraine, AI drones that are controlled by artificial intelligence are now on the rise. This has many advantages, but experts also warn of risks. Drones are indispensable on the front for both Ukraine and Russia. \"At any given time during the war, there are approximately 10,000 drones in the air. They are responsible for half of all hits,\" says Ukrainian Timur Zima of DroneAid. His foundation supplies drones to Ukraine from the Netherlands. These are often hobby drones that are equipped with explosives, making warfare considerably cheaper. Where a drone attack used to cost thousands of euros, it is now possible to take out a tank for a few hundred euros. No more pilot required Regular drones are no longer sufficient. In response to the increasing use of drones, countermeasures have become more sophisticated. Piloting drones requires a radio connection, but this connection is regularly disrupted by so-called jammers. AI drones do not need a radio connection, and can therefore carry out their kamikaze attacks independently. This process is known as last mile targeting and works as follows: Skip the carousel NOS NOS NOS NOS AI can also contribute to greater accuracy. In normal drone attacks, the target is hit in an estimated half of the cases. AI-controlled drones could significantly increase that percentage, says Timur. \"Right now it is being used in a few places, but my expectation is that in a year's time virtually all drones on the front line will have AI,\" says Zima. Turtle recognized as a weapon There are also concerns about the use of this technology. \"The system must be able to distinguish civilians from soldiers. Is someone carrying a weapon or uniform? If such a system makes a mistake, the consequences are serious,\" says Jonathan Kwik of the Asser Institute. He recently obtained his doctorate on the subject of autonomous weapon systems. According to Kwik, there is a good chance that a new form of warfare will emerge, in which the enemy misleads the opponent's AI system. He refers to a study in which scientists managed to print an invisible layer on the shell of a turtle, which made it recognized by the AI ​​as a weapon. \"You can imagine that many creative forms of manipulation are possible here.\" The development also raises legal questions, says professor of military law Marten Zwanenburg. For example, who is responsible if the system chooses to attack a target? \"Humanitarian law of war is lagging behind technological developments, and there are no specific rules for its use yet.\" There is a lot of international discussion about the subject. Rules will eventually be introduced, but according to Zwanenburg and Kwik that is a long-term process. At the moment, its use does not seem to be prohibited by definition. Watchbird.AI A demo of Watchbird.AI Avalor AI is a Dutch startup that develops AI drones. \"We started the company six months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\" says founder Maurits Korthals Altes. He travels to Ukraine regularly. \"First of all, we want to help Ukraine. Our goal is to ensure that soldiers can do their work as safely as possible.\" According to Korthals Altes, product development of defense equipment is often 'hypothetical'. \"The war in Ukraine offers companies the opportunity to validate whether their product works. In this way, we help each other.\" Regarding concerns about the use of AI drones, Korthals Altes says: \"It is mainly about the systems being able to fly autonomously, for example if the connection is lost. In terms of attacks, 'last mile targeting' is no different from what we already see with anti-tank weapons such as the Javelin,\" he says. \"The human identifies the target and then the machine can carry out the final steps independently.\" On the front in Ukraine, there is no time to wait for a perfect system or for regulations; Developments are moving too fast for that, says Zima of DroneAid. \"We are actually fighting a mirror. Everything we introduce, Russia has after two months, and vice versa. There is no other choice.\" High-tech from the Netherlands for Ukrainian drones",

The Cuban Missile Crisis was about short range Nuclear missiles as deterrence in Cuba vis-a-vi Turkiye in 1961, not long range missiles. Ballistic Missiles already existed. Ukraine gave up its Nuclear Missiles and Long Range Bombers for a broken promise never to be invaded.\n\nThe USA did not force Russia into invading Ukraine. This was never about NATO expansion into \"Russias sphere of influence\", it was about Russia trying to maintain its sphere of influence and internal power structure by making neighboring states dependent on or weak in comparison to Russia. Trying to maintain the KGB/FSB-Kremlin Power apparatus. Russia couldn't let Ukraine join the EU, a prosperous Ukraine could potentially lead to political discontent domestically in Russia. Putin forced Yanukovych to backtrack on the original association agreement in 2013 just weeks prior to the signing, his 2010 Election Campaign was literally for joining the EU, until Putin pressed in 2013. Ukrainians have literally been attempting to vote to join the EU ever since 1991 only to be stemmed by corruption deeply rooted to Russia throughout the decades. USA \"meddling\" in Ukraine pales in comparison to Russia's. Putin, and Putin himself made the war about NATO after the full scale ramp up of the war in 2022 (its been on for 10 years now....). Ukrainians were still largely for Military neutrality, even after the events starting in 2014 until Putin started the full scale assault in 2022. If this was truly about NATO, there would've been some sort of reaction from Russia when Sweden and Finland were added to the alliance after his puppet Orban couldn't delay any longer. Instead of a reaction, Putin just sent the forces and equipment along the border with Finland straight to Ukraine....\n\nOn top of all that, just to add: Oil Companies found the massive oil field in Donetsk/Kharkiv Oblasts only in 2011. Tying back to the prosperity viewpoint... Russia's GDP is completely reliant on exports of Oil and Natural Gas, Ukraine being a new player in the Oil/NG export market is not suitable for Putin.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nMy wife and I currently live in Turkey, and I’m a Turkish citizen. My wife is Ukrainian, and we met before the Russian invasion.\n\nWe’ve been here for over two years, but I’ve noticed how much my wife misses her family. I also liked them when they visited and they’re kind people.\n\nI’ve been thinking about moving to Ukraine (possibly Uzhhorod) since we don’t know when the war will end, and being away from her family is affecting my wife. I also want to support Ukraine by living and spending money there. My wife supports this idea.\n\nHowever, I have some concerns:\n\n1. Is it possible if women called for military service or travel restrictions?\n\n2. I’m a software developer with enough savings to live in Ukraine approximately for 2 years, but I don’t want to use up everything or sell my belongings in Turkey. Since my current job only allows remote work in Turkey, I’ll need to quit. Is it possible to find remote (or on-site near Uzhhorod) software developer jobs in Ukraine with just English?\n\n3. I’m not sure if there are other things I haven’t considered yet, so any advice is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance for your answers,\n\nEdit: Thank all of you for your answers and advice, each of your comments was very valuable.",

If I recall correctly it resulted in the government asking women to register/inform local authorities about their specialty (e.g. if they are medics or something). I don't know anyone who actually did that. My partner is Ukrainian and she travels to Ukraine once every couple of months, nobody made her go and register anywhere. \n\n2. No idea. I would recommend first just to interview with companies and just asking them if it's ok if you work remotely from Uzhhorod. \n\n3. Travel will be much less convenient compared to Turkey.\n\na) Civilian air traffic os closed for obvious reasons\n\nb) Crossing the border is slow: spending ~8 hours at the checkpoint is not uncommon. Mainly because border guards check every bus/vehicle extra diligently/slow. At least from anecdotes from people I know who went to/from Ukraine through checkpoints in Moldova, Romania and Poland. But maybe it's better near Uzhhorod.\n\nLast one. Relocation is a big decision. I would recommend for your wife to do come to parents for couple of months and see if she wants to move permanently, or maybe couple of months here, couple of months there is fine. I heard multiple stories about people moving abroad, getting homesick, moving back, realizing that being home actually kind of sucks and then moving back to the West.",

So there are a lot of people here who want jobs. \n\nBefore that it was kind of cool because companies were hiring cheap employees in Ukraine and selling their work to the West for more money. Imagine we have 10 specialists and the majority of them worked for western companies. Yes you could find 1 Ukrainian business.

You don't have internet, you don't have even mobile connection because they satellite towers will be turned off too. It's hard. \n\nMaybe russians will hit atomic power plants.

And so they tried a carrot instead of a stick, calling it Perestroika (\"Rebuilding\") and cozying up to western powers who clearly won the cold war.\n\nThis sudden relaxing of the police state's grip began to allow for some initiatives to flower, and before long one of the strongest emerged in Lviv, called The Society of the Lion, an informal group of young people who wanted to more than be a widget in the ussr machine.\n\nThey banded together, with an inception date of October 16th, 1987, at first as a purely cultural and ethnographical society and even shrewdly established itself under the organization of communist youth. \n\nIts mission was to \"reject the Soviet traditions as inauthentic and falsified, and to challenge its status in culture.” At the same time they wanted to redefine what it means to be a Ukrainian and what it means to be a citizen of a state - seeing the truth clearly despite decades of being forced to view their own culture through a russian lens.  But without overexaggerating, this little movement played an outsized role in the struggle for the restoration of Ukrainian statehood in the second half of the 1980s.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# The Roar\n\n[Lion Society-related images, late 1980s](https://preview.redd.it/6pn4p3qtz7ud1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2093ba91be13114946281d5d2b72f8c2fd7ea586)\n\nThe Lion Society leadership started small. Their first major initiative was to organize a volunteer day to clean up and work on the restorations of monuments at the Lychakiv Cemetery.  But they ramped up fast!\n\nWhy the lion?  Well, the city of Lviv literally means \"lion\".  You can read more about the city's thousand-year-old history in these sunrise posts: [Lviv Early History](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vbsarl/446_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_111th_day_of/) | [Lviv 19th Century](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vdagzl/446_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_113th_day_of/) | [Lviv 20th Century](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/ve1ljd/446_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_114th_day_of/) | [Lviv 21st Century](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vevk80/446_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_115th_day_of/).  Lions have been associated with the city and region of Halychyna since the early 14th century!\n\nIn the fall of 1987, the Society organized an evening dedicated to the memory of Vasyl Symonenko.  We wrote about this amazing person, and his tragic life cut short, in [this sunrise post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/10t4u87/729_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_346th_day_of_the/).  This memorial gained scandalous attention because it was one of the first times that major Ukrainian political dissidents Vyacheslav Chornovil and Mykhailo Horyn spoke after their release from russian prison.  \n\nSoon after, they organized a concert dedicated to Volodymyr Ivasiuk, another Ukrainian luminary killed by russians.  We wrote about him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uhwg6w/528_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_70th_day_of_the/).  Later, the society became associated with many concerts and festivals.\n\n[Concert in Lviv.  The sign says \\\\\"You're invited by Lion Society\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/cp9j8yiy38ud1.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edc066807eeb9c9798ba951b14ce2fa11ce029ff)\n\nThe Society also made it their priority to revive Ukrainian folk traditions (nativity plays, haivky, the [Night of Ivan Kupalo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vseh8o/454_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_133rd_day_of/) festivities, etc.) and organized ethnographic expeditions to collect songs and traditions, as many aspects of Ukrainian culture were on the verge of extinction due to long decades of neglect and suppression by the communist regime.  In 1988 they organized a nature expedition that still runs to this day.  They revitalized some practices that had been all but destroyed by the soviet system, including the unique art of Havaretska ceramics, which we will write about in the future.\n\n[1988 Exhibition postcard for Havaretska ceramics, which the society helped to revitalize.](https://preview.redd.it/8jrizokr18ud1.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=363aa9c5c04ebb5b27fec1695938207741038294)\n\nThe members of the Society even sought connections to Ukrainian communities outside of Ukraine.  My sister, a member of the Society herself, shared stories about an expedition to Zelenyi Klyn (often called \"Green Ukraine\"), an area in the the far east of russia exclusively populated by Ukrainian farmers.  They also organized with the diaspora in Canada!\n\nIn the spring of 1989, Society activists began publishing one of Ukraine's first independent newspapers.  Called Postup, it was distributed hand to hand - including by “mules” like my father and... yours truly (though I barely remember anything from that young age, I will still take a little credit!).\n\n[A page from Postup, 1990.](https://preview.redd.it/h97suqlkr7ud1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a8910bf519ceb37d801287813f0b4a578d4434c)\n\nInspired by the successful work of the Society, similar initiatives were established in other cities in Ukraine, and from its ranks many cultural and political leaders emerged over the years.\n\n**One of the most evocative moments as the soviet union crumbled was the detainment of Lion Society members who attended the 1989 Chervona Ruta festival.  Their crime?  Wearing yellow blouses with blue skirts.  In russian words, \"extreme nationalism\".**\n\nYou can see Vasyl Zhdankin, one of the most amazing folk singers, perform at Chervona Ruta in 1989, and admonish the police for their brutality, in [this sunrise post translation video.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/15661y8/511_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_514th/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# The Lion's Share\n\n[More Lion Society-related images](https://preview.redd.it/ury2yjz708ud1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3113ff686d6ff6391a4dac9f6bec5fdc2150c80)\n\nMaybe the best the role of The Society of Lion in the end of the USSR, is described by one of its members - today a professor at Lviv’s Art Academy - Ihor Havryshkevych:\n\n“Very quickly, those who were thirsty for the ancient Ukrainian traditions, rallied around it.\n\n&gt;Soon, the process of reviving these traditions, regardless of the actual mission of the Society of the Lion, became an explosion of the struggle for \\[national -ed.\\] freedom. \n\n&gt;The entire society was so compressed by the fear of prohibitions that it resembled a powder keg. The fuse of that powder keg was lit when the Society of the Lion organized the first Haivky \\[festivities dedicated to Spring - ed.\\] near the church in the Shevchenkivskyi Grove in Lviv in 1988 - and many people realized that it was possible not only to revive national traditions but also to preserve memory, without fear.\n\n&gt;The Society's wise moderation in all its subsequent pro-Ukrainian initiatives quickly attracted the attention of Ukrainian, Baltic, and other dissidents. It was here that the idea of encompassing all of Ukraine with a youth movement was born, leading to the creation of the Student Brotherhood in 1988, as well as the formation of numerous chapters of the Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian Language Society and the Ukrainian Cultural Club in Kyiv.\n\n&gt;From everything that was happening at the time, it gave the impression that the Society of the Lion had so precisely and timely ignited the fire of freedom that it consistently spread across the entire enslaved Ukrainian nation, leading them into an uncompromising struggle for freedom, which was later united by the People’s Movement of Ukraine and culminated in victory in 1991.”\n\nWith time, the cultural prominence of Lion Society faded a bit as other initiatives began to take priority.  However, the group still exists today but its activities are mostly in Lviv.  However, we need to give the Society its due, as one has to wonder how the world would look today if not for this group of young, hopeful people who literally changed the course of Ukrainian history and the history of the world. \n\nAnd perhaps it is a little selfish of me, but I also want to share that my very most favorite memory of my older sister is when I saw her radiant young face beaming with happiness when she would return from the Society’s weekly meeting.  Her relaxed smile is all I needed to understand the difference between the freedom of expression and oppression.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**The Hymn of the Society of The Lion**\n\n*Written by Oleh Pokalchuk*\n\n&gt;Before dawn the shadows grow deep, \n\n&gt;Before the storm it's harder to breathe, \n\n&gt;Hey, Society, in every plight \n\n&gt;We won’t abandon friends to their fate, \n\n&gt;We praise the light of free ideas \n\n&gt;In the midst of our homeland's night, \n\n&gt;Happiness from God, glory from men \n\n&gt;We do not seek, but earn!\n\n&gt;Together — forward!

We've had quite a bit of a pro-russian presence in the greater Verona area since way before the invasion during almost 20y of right-wing political tenure, and there's definitely some fifth column shit happening to this day.\n\nJust to add a little extra context, the needle of the local political scene's compass has been pretty much constantly stuck on the right quadrant ever since 2002, and that became especially prevalent in the last mayoral run from 2017 to 2022, when we had an elected mayor whose political background is, and please act surprised when you read this, firmly rooted in [Italy's second most favorite postfascist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Alliance_(Italy)). During this timespan we had an [unofficial DNR diplomatic office/\"embassy\"](https://jamestown.org/program/italy-ukraine-relations-signs-of-improvement-but-no-breakthrough/) (as in not recognized by the Italian government but often involved in events/fora/PR stunts involving the local right-wing scene) pop up in 2019 in addition to the an official RF diplomatic office, opened in 2008 and defunct since shortly after the invasion.\n\nNow that the ball's in the field of a center/left-leaning mayor, there's been less buzz about that aside from the odd [odd fifth column PR stunt](https://www.larena.it/territorio-veronese/citta/caso-manifesti-filorussi-1.12453166) backed by people stemming from Lega Nord (incidentally, a party who originally kicked off as a pro-secessionist, with strongly implied ties to the russosphere and the most reactionary, destabilizing parties within the EU) and [Italy's most favourite postfascist party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Force_(Italy)). As for the more overt support of the invasion and the shit that has been happening ever since, it seems fair to point out that we had a worrying amount of \"[anti-NATO pro-peace rallies](https://corrieredelveneto.corriere.it/verona/politica/22_maggio_10/verona-corteo-anti-nato-diventa-notizia-russia-42d5e202-d03f-11ec-a7c6-4db6d8e1e645.shtml)\" run and crowded by some of the same rabble-rousers that ran the COVID-negationist antivax rallies a couple years prior ([and more vocal PR stunts](https://www.larena.it/territorio-veronese/citta/lista-zelger-lettera-choc-a-putin-aiutaci-a-resistere-nella-lotta-per-la-democrazia-in-italia-1.9331371)).

    "selftext": "\nRoyal United Services Institute\n\nCommentary\nPuzzling Pieces: OSINT and War Crime Accountability in Ukraine\nAndrea Ricci and Jack Crawford\n26 September 2024\nLong Read\nCrime scene\n\nFollowing Ukraine’s signature of the Rome Statute, paving the way towards full ICC membership, it is more important than ever to ensure that open source intelligence can successfully enable accountability for Russian war crimes.\n\nKyiv’s signature of the statute on 21 August came several weeks after Russia’s 8 July attack on a paediatric hospital, which killed over 35 people (including four children) and injured another 190, in Russia’s latest egregious crime committed during its war of aggression in Ukraine. In the face of such a tragedy, OSINT analysts in Ukraine and further afield were quick to identify the make and composition of the Kh-101 missile that hit the hospital, denying Russia the opportunity to mask the attack and affirming the increasing relevance of OSINT in holding the Kremlin accountable.\n\nOSINT's relevance to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is no coincidence, but rather the result of OSINT’s gradual development and acceptance in recent years, in parts thanks to advancements in data tools including geolocation and chronolocation software. Realising its full potential requires a coordinated and prepared approach from government, the private sector and civil society – no small undertaking.\n\nSquaring the Evidentiary Triangle\nToday, from Luhansk to Lviv and around the world, the online community is filming, posting and resharing evidence of Russian war crimes on social media, online fora and journalistic sites in the hope that someday, victims might hold the guilty to account.\n\nThe adoption of OSINT techniques in documenting modern crises has demonstrated a need to expand the production of criminal evidence beyond the traditional triangle of law enforcement, forensic experts and witnesses.\n\nSince the aftermath of the Second World War, OSINT has gradually played a more pivotal role in holding perpetrators of international transgressions to account. For example, starting in 1945, photography and film offered critical evidence during the Nuremberg Trials. From 1993–94, documentation from news channels, online fora and satellite imagery led to the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Beginning in the 2000s, cell phone photos and videos, geo-referencing tools, drones and social media captured information crucial for the hybrid internationalised tribunals for the conflicts in Sierra Leone and Cambodia in 2001 and Lebanon in 2009. Finally, in March 2011, images of clashes in Darʿā, a rural province of southern Syria, changed everything, giving birth to the first ‘war feeds’, or ‘digital war in plain sight’.  During the Syrian conflict, OSINT was regularly pivotal in correcting war narratives, especially surrounding the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons. \n\nIn We Are Bellingcat, Elliot Higgins highlights how, even as hopes for international support in Syria dwindled, OSINT analysts continued documenting and disseminating evidence of human rights violations on social media. Collaborations like the Google/Bellingcat-supported Syrian Archive validated the dangers faced by Syrians in gathering evidence and solidified OSINT’s role in facilitating evidence collection. \n\nSpinning the ‘Web of Accountability’\nWhat was once a fledgling ecosystem of citizen journalists has grown into an organised cohort of OSINT practitioners documenting, analysing and presenting open source evidence in court, ultimately pursuing greater degrees of accountability for criminals and malign actors than ever before.\n\nUkraine and its partners have jointly pursued a ‘web of accountability’ – a term coined in March 2023 at the United for Justice conference in Lviv – for war crime investigations in Ukraine. However, the pseudo-network of strands comprising this web are messy and convoluted, spanning an amalgamation of actors in nearly as many jurisdictions.\n\nWhat was once a fledgling ecosystem of citizen journalists has grown into an organised cohort of OSINT practitioners documenting, analysing and presenting open source evidence in court\n\nCurrently, the OSINT network dedicated to uncovering war crimes in Ukraine comprises – at a minimum – six legal firms, nine academic hubs, 19 OSINT investigative teams (including names like Berkeley’s Human Rights Investigations Lab, Osint For Ukraine, Global Rights Compliance and the Ukrainian Molfar), 17 special IT projects (which range from apps like e-Enemy to blockchain solutions like project Dokas), a sub-network of 23 judicial bodies in Ukraine and further afield, and 39 civil society organisations (including the 5AM Coalition) that collect and document potential war crimes and crimes against humanity. These actors are intricately linked with judicial authorities across the West and around the world. \n\nThe Joint Investigation Team and the CICED Database at Eurojust epitomise this collaborative spirit, pooling resources and evidence with enhanced support. Additionally, the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group – a collaborative venture between the EU, UK and US – provides tailored guidance to war crime prosecutors.  Another effort, the Dialogue Group on Accountability for Ukraine – an initiative led by Ukraine, the ICC and the EU – aggregates workstreams from Ukraine's General Prosecution Office, international accountability actors, domestic and foreign accountability providers, and civil society organisations. USAID’s Human Rights in Action Programme is funding study visits and advanced training (inclusive of OSINT modules) in international criminal law and justice for Ukrainian lawyers. Europol has also established an OSINT taskforce to facilitate international investigations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The Council of Europe has launched the CyberUA project, which aims to enhance Ukraine's capabilities in handling electronic evidence related to war crimes and gross human rights violations. In short, there are several notable cases of successful international cooperation in leveraging open source information for documenting war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nBetween these achievements, however, interorganisational coordination is arduous. Actors may not know of each other's existence and do not necessarily have the means, forums or trust to collaborate. ‘The current landscape lacks a unified model for archiving war crimes evidence, with various platforms operating in isolation and without full integration’, stressed Roksolana Burianenko, former programme manager for Mnemonic’s Ukrainian Archive. ‘The key issue is the absence of a coordinated approach and a governance system to harmonise efforts across different archives and actors. Such coordination is essential not only for accountability, but also for creating a digital memorial that captures the Ukrainian people's suffering. In our digital age, establishing these archives and memorials should, and could, happen much faster than in the past’.\n\nThe result is paradoxical: actors across nearly every sector of society are tackling overlapping aspects of war crimes investigations, but those same actors are so siloed that communication is inconsistent and cooperation is sporadic, even in the digital age.\n\nLeveraging OSINT\nDespite the strengths that OSINT lends to war crime investigations, the sheer amount of information (and disinformation) in the open sources, the costs of upskilling to use this information, and judicial wariness of open source information pose several challenges.\n\nInformation Overload\nThe immense and ever-growing volume of digital evidence – from sources including social media, blogs, online forums, CCTV footage, livestreams and satellite – deepens the web of accountability’s inefficiency. The Ukrainian Archive contains a staggering 6,930,635 videos from 9,567 sources, and even this represents only a fraction of the pieces of open source evidence amassed by the 5AM Coalition. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office keeps a diligent count of registered crimes of aggression and war crimes since February 2022. At the time of writing, this number exceeds 143,899 – a testament to the enormity of the task at hand. For comparison, the office records only 19,274 crimes against national security in the same period. \n\n‘Overall, we have 5 million digital records in our system’, says a chief investigator for Mnemonic. ‘We are preserving the potential human rights violations and possible war crimes from all parties, but only a small percentage is being really analysed. While preservation of data was our initial priority, the community now aims to undertake analysis, mapping and tagging on a larger scale to harness the full potential of the preserved data. With all the data we have collected it would take decades, probably, if not longer, to investigate every single one of these files!’\n\nAdditionally, the volatile nature of conflict zones and the complexity of war crimes make it difficult to verify the authenticity of digital evidence. Russia has enthusiastically compounded these issues by flooding online spaces with disinformation and propaganda, propagating conflicting narratives and leveraging deepfake technology in ways that highlight the need for continuous adaptation and innovation in the use of OSINT. \n\nProhibitive Capacity-Building Costs\nIf the overwhelming availability of OSINT evidence is one problem, the costs of storing and processing this evidence represent another. \n\n‘There's a pressing need for a technological platform’, argues Lindsay Freeman, co-author of the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations, ‘that enables civil society groups and documentarians on the ground to securely store digital evidence. This idea, like a ‘digital evidence locker’, has been widely discussed, but even the biggest NGOs face significant challenges in scaling and securing such operations’.\n\nOnce this evidence is stored, investigators and legal professionals often require training to ensure they can efficiently handle and process OSINT-generated evidence. Thus, another obstruction facing the coordinated use of OSINT by actors investigating war crimes is a difficult trade-off: should they invest time, resources and funding into trainings and platform subscriptions, or leave investigators aimlessly sifting through datasets that grow with each social media post and website refresh, further burying key evidence?\n\nAs a result, actors with more resources can advance their application of OSINT in their investigations, while others are left further behind in capacity and capabilities. This disparity exacerbates the web of accountability’s patchwork use of OSINT. ‘Technical trainings on software techniques and OSINT methods should not be confined to exclusive clubs; there is a need of some form of modernisation and update of these investigative and legal communities to achieve a more effective usage of the concept of Universal Jurisdiction’, says Burianenko. \n\nCourtroom Challenges\nFrom a judicial perspective, accountability structures need time to adapt to the introduction of OSINT as an evidence collection tool as well.\n\nFor example, courts often have varying admissibility criteria for open source evidence, which needs to be handled accordingly. ‘I'm certainly not against open-source investigations’, Freeman clarifies, ‘but I insist on their execution within the bounds of legal standards. It's heartening to see many in the OSINT field have significantly honed their methodologies … [but some] tend to leap to conclusions prematurely. In criminal proceedings, where establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is the cornerstone, selecting a single hypothesis from a spectrum without adequately exploring alternative scenarios can be a major oversight’.\n\nIt is imperative for Ukraine and its partners to wade through the challenges of a coordinated and consistent use of OSINT in holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable\n\nFreeman also indicates that the aforementioned information deluge compounds the legal difficulties of using OSINT. ‘Much of what's captured during a conflict is [more relevant] for historians and won't directly feed into crime documentation … Flooding [judges] with an excessive amount of information is not just tactically unsound; it risks prolonging the trial unnecessarily and could potentially infringe upon procedural efficiency’. For actors to use OSINT to evidence war crimes in a way that could be effective in judicial proceedings, they therefore need to be incisively selective.\n\n‘The essence is “data minimisation”, to gather only what's pertinent to the case at hand’, continues Freeman. ‘This requires setting precise research questions and establishing a clear investigative direction – to discern what must be proven and what evidence is genuinely relevant, whether it incriminates or exonerates’.\n\nA Labour of Love\nIt is imperative for Ukraine and its partners to wade through the challenges of a coordinated and consistent use of OSINT in holding perpetrators of war crimes accountable. Thankfully, several mechanisms are already in place that could facilitate both a more efficient, well-connected web of accountability and the closer integration of OSINT into that web. \n\nThe EU, which supports Ukrainian rule of law institutions and agencies with EUAM Ukraine, is investing over €10 million to support the ICC, as well as over €6 million on IT and equipment for the Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s Training Centre, civil society organisations and new, dedicated accountability structures. EUAM has also helped coordinate workshops designed to assist Ukrainian legal offices and courts with admitting OSINT war crime evidence.\n\nOther allies of Ukraine are pursuing similar support and coordination structures. For example, the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) aims to be ‘the first step in this process to preserve evidence and prepare cases for future trials’ with the help of a joint investigation team led by Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Romania, and with additional participation from the ICC and financial support from the US. The EU also supports the Register of Damage, which records ‘claims and evidence on damage, loss or injury caused by the Russian Federation’s internationally illegal acts in or against Ukraine’. \n\nAs initiatives like the ICPA seek greater coordination for evidence collection and processing, other partners are specifically facilitating opportunities to boost OSINT capabilities. In December 2023, the UK committed £3.7 million to the ‘documentation, investigation, and prosecution of war crimes committed in Ukraine’, which will fund training for Ukrainian authorities to develop ‘skills in verifying and utilising open-source intelligence, including materials uploaded by mobile phones to social media, and train prosecutors in preparing strong and well-evidenced legal cases’.\n\nThese efforts, among others, to develop a comprehensive, technology-centric and OSINT-enabled approach are encouraging, but there is always more work to be done. As stated by the ICPA, ‘we are dealing with an international crime that has rarely been prosecuted and for which there is no standard practice’. Holding war crimes perpetrators accountable will require an equally unprecedented commitment to innovative collaboration in evidencing and prosecuting atrocious crimes in Ukraine, but the benefits of doing so – chief among them, a secure and sovereign Ukraine – are worth the effort.\n\nThe views expressed in this Commentary are the authors’, and do not represent those of RUSI or any other institution.\n\n\n\n",

Currently, her professional interests include the development of public spaces and the use of biodegradable building materials made from technical hemp[.](https://imgur.com/a/WsSrdp8)\n\nOriginally from Donetsk (one of the first Ukrainian cities occupied by Russia in 2014 – ed.), Olena has been living in Sumy since 2014, where she has since developed a deep sense of home.\n\n“This is a city of hidden opportunities. In fact, this phrase is even featured in our development concept. And it becomes clear only after you get to know the city a little better.”\n\nShe says that the proximity to the Russian border inevitably affects Sumy: investments are primarily directed towards defence, while niche development initiatives remain underfunded. However, the community keeps making long-term plans and implementing timely projects. For example, Olena was involved in the Urban Coalition Ro3kvit — a group of over 100 experts from Ukraine and abroad developing methodologies for Ukraine’s further growth and recovery. Together, they presented a housing project for internally displaced persons (IDPs) that allows them to stay in the community rather than merely viewing it as a transit point. Olena believes that the issue of providing decent housing remains inadequately addressed, as the influx of people has led to many solutions being temporary.\n\nOlena points out that while Sumy has many architectural associations, the real issue is whether people actually consult them before launching architectural projects.\n\n“Clients frequently attempt to save money on projects and develop designs on their own. They simply avoid working on load-bearing structures to bypass the need for approvals. They rely on Pinterest for designs.”\n\nOlena notes that projects developed by young specialists are often volunteer-based and frequently remain unimplemented.\n\n“Professional teams are united by an internal philosophy and a desire not just to make money, but to live in a city where it’s not only acceptable to live but also a great place to spend time. It’s fascinating to watch how these communities form: starting with just two or three people, then growing to 10, 20, 30 people within a month, and finally evolving into a kind of movement.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3k286g4kd2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0d270aff38b4d7488016e4595fc8d86fe441756\n\nOlena points out that while Sumy has many architectural associations, the real issue is whether people actually consult them before launching architectural projects.\n\n“Clients frequently attempt to save money on projects and develop designs on their own.

It’s fascinating to watch how these communities form: starting with just two or three people, then growing to 10, 20, 30 people within a month, and finally evolving into a kind of movement.”\n\nAmong the examples of communities seeking to influence the city, Olena mentions the “Sumy of the Future” initiative, which creates projects for street reconstruction and developing embankments.\n\nOlena believes that the architecture market in Sumy is still developing. Clients often do not fully understand the value of work and solutions offered by specialists. However, her experience proves that people become more receptive when the importance of certain decisions is clearly explained.\n\n“We turn down projects when clients don’t understand why we are doing something, but such cases are extremely rare. For example, we recently managed to design a small café – just 30 square metres – and included an accessible restroom. That proves that, with the right approach, it’s achievable. When clients are properly informed, they never oppose these considerations.”\n\nRegarding accessibility in Sumy, Olena notes that progress largely depends on the initiative of concerned individuals.\n\n# “It’s moving towards greater accessibility, but only when someone actively drives this idea and concept. When momentum stalls, it remains stalled.”\n\nOlena believes that the surroundings of Sumy offer significant potential for innovative construction, particularly through the use of biodegradable materials. This approach not only benefits the environment but also considers the region’s agricultural nature and current conditions.\n\n“We don’t have enough forests; we’ve already exhausted this resource. We simply need an alternative.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nyevr3hod2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d09b15d78962bdce9d7838d1b8d97582c046df1d\n\nOlena believes that implementing such initiatives requires active promotion, and Sumy has a platform for this. For instance, the independent Sumy-based media outlet Tsukr has gained popularity far beyond the city.\n\n“I think activists working on their own tasks and topics need to speak out more, be visible in the media, present their work everywhere, and basically shout about the ideas they are passionate about.”\n\n**Youth forge of ideas and events**\n\nDmytro Tishchenko is a journalist and activist with a deep understanding of his city and a direct impact on its development. In particular, he contributes to local projects such as the media outlets Tsukr, and initiatives like “Hub on Kuznechna”, and “Courtyard on Kuznechna”.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xy03eqaqd2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2d7d162ae17ef628b0a84e497eceb2b5f29578f\n\nSince 2014, Kuznecha street has been home to the “Sumy” charitable foundation, which initially supported Sumy residents participating in the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO). Nearby, there was a large, neglected state owned by the state. It was owned by the state. In 2017, Dmytro and his colleagues reached an agreement with the local authorities to repurpose this space for holding events, meetings of civic activists, and other community activities.\n\n“We took inspiration from a format in Kyiv called ‘networking for change-makers.’ We wanted to replicate something similar in Sumy and needed an open space — we thought it should be outdoors. During our search for locations, we repeatedly approached the administration, who said, ‘Look, there is a courtyard there – enhance it and hold your events.’ ‘Enhance it’ was an understatement, as it had been accumulating layers of garbage for probably 15–20 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81bvhvgsd2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2cbe9d53b0ac72e4ef996dec263ee5a1429993\n\nThe most active period was 2018 and 2019, where volunteers were busy organising the space, and events were taking place one after another.\n\n“In the first year, we almost went crazy – we held 150 events. We really ‘treated’ people with whatever they wanted because they were hungry for information on various topics. This was particularly true during the decentralisation reform, and all of these issues were discussed here.”\n\nDmytro mentions the drastic decrease in activities during the 2020 – 2021 pandemic, which was further exacerbated by the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022.\n\n“On the morning of 25 February, I took the last photo of the hub in its original state because soon after, it was immediately repurposed for various humanitarian needs.”\n\nAfter the start of the Russian invasion, all hub activities – from making Molotov cocktails to sorting medicines and food – sought to support local civilians and the city’s defenders.\n\n“When the Russian troops finally retreated (from the north of the country — ed.), we admitted that we needed to continue operating rather than just sitting on the remaining canned tomatoes, which had nowhere else to go,” Dmytro recalls.\n\nThe team decided to reconsider their next steps and realised that after everything the community had been through, there was a need for people to see each other and come together. Initially, they focused on conducting informative and educational events, like discussing the history of Slobozhanshchyna and Russification. Later, the hub added a cultural component, and now the yard regularly hosts live music, stand-up comedy, and theatre performances. The hub has also become a space for recording podcasts and lending equipment to various projects. In 2022, the team introduced a form allowing local residents to suggest events. However, by 2024, this became increasingly challenging due to security conditions and financial limitations stemming from dependency on grantors, and difficulties in expanding the donor community as most people prefer directing their funds toward military needs.\n\n“It operates on a minimal budget, but it’s a respectable kind of minimal, where you can still afford to host a concert or hold a business meeting,” Dmytro says.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axk66rhvd2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c230bc7f3509ecf91533008c86c1033c549b743b\n\nResponding to a question about interactions with local self-government, Dmytro explains that they generally manage to find common ground with certain officials who are interested in specific issues. For instance, during our filming in the summer of 2024, both the public and the authorities were preparing to discuss the information space.\n\n“It won’t immediately result in any groundbreaking solution, but starting to synchronise our efforts and having these discussions is extremely valuable. There is no goal to achieve a grand outcome, like making everyone friends or turning the world upside down. Instead, it is about introducing people to each other.”\n\nThe initiative originated from the local media outlet Tsukr, which emerged during the pandemic when, as Dmytro puts it, “it was the only way to connect with people who wanted to see something positive happening in the city.”\n\n“Now it’s a kind of self-governing community. People support us financially, gradually become more involved, and come together. Some submit petitions, while others invite government representatives to meetings.”\n\nDmytro observes that crises often create opportunities for proactive initiatives and serve as catalysts for change. For instance, in 2019, the media outlet Tsukr bore little resemblance to traditional journalism. By 2020, they started using simple language to explain the course of the pandemic. Then, in 2022, they almost unintentionally evolved into communicators focused on highlighting the needs of the local community.\n\n“We tried to keep the spirit of resilience alive. As sentimental as it might sound, people needed to hear, ‘We are here, we are working, we are doing this. Let’s work together, join us, send donations, we will purchase whatever is necessary.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fs8dkhxd2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38ffbc4695239c8853703a9cbd0d09a236eadda\n\nAccording to Dmytro, their goal was to maintain a pro-Ukrainian information space.\n\n“Volunteers would come and say, ‘Open the hub for us; we are setting up a headquarters here.’ Others would say, ‘Let us moderate the chat because people are panicking.’ Psychologists and other helpers would come, and our task was bringing all these components together into something functional, a cohesive organism.”\n\nDmytro believes that while focusing on security is justified, the concept of investing solely in defence does not resonate with him. He illustrates his perspective with an example from March 2022, where a stand-up show was held in a bomb shelter. On one hand, Dmytro acknowledges the paradox of organising such an event in the city under threat, yet people gather to laugh, and the organisers invested time in it. On the other hand, he highlights the indescribable sense of community and unity that emerged from this experience.\n\n“At the same time, it’s also a huge middle finger to the Russians trying to encircle, stop, or occupy us, while we come together to laugh at them. I’m sure they don’t directly watch this content or take offence, but it’s about how we, as a community, feel at the moment.”\n\nAnother poignant moment occurred in August 2023, which Dmytro shared on his social media. After a performance at the “Courtyard on Kuznechna”, a soldier took to the stage. He had returned home for a day, while his family was abroad and unable to meet him. He expressed his gratitude, stressing the importance of culture, and thanked everyone for providing him with a place to spend that day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tw5thtdzd2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cea1a8ba5f998779ca05caca2fc8de2b7cd3427\n\nDmytro claims that culture generally doesn’t require massive budgets, and he jokingly adds that sometimes it’s enough just not to interfere. The presence of cultural activities, opportunities to relax and recharge significantly impact locals. If venues close, events stop, and landmarks are left unrepaired, it can affect the mental state of those remaining in the city and may even signal that it’s time to evacuate.\n\n“We spoke with a coffee shop owner, and he said, ‘I realise my responsibility. Right now, I’m not \\[just\\] an entrepreneur, and what I do is a litmus test.’ If people see the coffee shop closed tomorrow, \\[they’ll think\\], ‘That’s it, it’s time to leave.’”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fuzu361e2qd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e92b7ad730b215f62d2119a4d8d8f45ee266692\n\nWhen discussing his vision for the future of Sumy, Dmytro emphasises two key concepts: cosiness and vibrancy.\n\n“We are doing everything we can to keep Sumy as cosy as it is. I think many locals will understand what I mean, and for those who are not from here, it’s something you need to experience firsthand.\n\nI believe that Sumy needs to find a new way to be better than the big cities. Small towns have many advantages, but we haven’t fully learned to recognise them because we tend to view ourselves as the periphery. We are combating this inferiority complex.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 941st day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Living just 30 kilometres from the aggressor’s border, Sumy residents balance their efforts between investing in defence and funding city development[.](https://imgur.com/a/FumWHxk)\n\nIn this article from the “Restoration” project, we explore how Sumy is coping with the aftermath of Russian shelling, constructing shelters, preparing for potential enemy attacks, and, more importantly, how it refuses to remain in a state of waiting for better times — life in the city continues to bustle.\n\nWe will speak with the director of a hospital damaged by the shelling, local government representatives, an architect involved in local projects, and the co-founder of a Sumy online magazine to understand how the city is recovering and developing during the war.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9apfmjw5hpd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d45808e1f0958abad03e84eb7e140fd6d2b4678f\n\n**On shelters, medical care, and reconstruction**\n\nWhen local pharmacies closed at the beginning of the full-scale war, the Central City Clinical Hospital stepped in, distributing its medical supplies to Sumy residents. This support was particularly crucial for the elderly. Some patients even had to live at the hospital after finding out during their treatment that their villages had been occupied by the Russian army.\n\nThe hospital director, Valentyna Dominas, admits that on the first day of Russia’s full-scale invasion, she was worried she might not find any staff at the hospital. However, her fears were unfounded.\n\n“On 24 February (the first day of the full-scale Russian invasion – ed.), our entire team showed up, and we’ve been working as a full team ever since. Almost no one left their post.”\n\nNot only did the staff stay and continue working, but they also managed to launch a cardiac surgery department amid the all-out war. For this purpose, the team invited specialists to the hospital, and even started performing organ transplants while hostilities unfolded across the country.\n\n# “There are fewer and fewer Ukrainians, and we must fight for every Ukrainian life.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y1u9unve5hpd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e1f0b1f4cce105b3146deeb21c16b7af25ac5b0\n\nDespite repeated damage from Russian shelling, the hospital was repaired each time and continued to operate without interruption Valentyna recalls how, after the second shelling, the services, local authorities, and hospital staff came together to address the immediate consequences of the attack.\n\n# “There was about half an hour of confusion while everyone processed what had happened. Then, it became clear that we needed to collect the glass, remove the damaged windows, cover things up, and help wherever possible.”\n\nThe hospital has its development and improvement budget, part of which is allocated to fund repairs after shelling. Valentyna shared that it also covered the repairs to surgical equipment following an attack that damaged two operating rooms.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lcc8s6h5hpd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3710fca71325619d58329be92b77eab77842b92\n\nDeputy Mayor Stanislav Poliakov adds that the city receives substantial support from charitable organisations that either assist on-site after shelling or handle part of the restoration work. These organisations include Dobrobat, World Central Kitchen, Right to Protection, Caritas, Proliska, and others, which allow local authorities to focus on broader issues without spreading their efforts and resources too thin.\n\nAt the same time, Oleksii Drozdenko, the head of the Sumy City Military Administration, emphasises the need to properly coordinate all those willing to aid in the restoration efforts. He recalls instances when volunteers arrived at the site of enemy impact faster than the services that could assess whether it was safe to be there.\n\n“Everyone is now well-coordinated, and everything works absolutely smoothly. When I arrive, there are people to work with and those who help. It’s a characteristic of ours: everyone rushes to the site of impact, rather than scattering.”\n\nAccording to Oleksii Drozdenko, in 2024, the city experienced an increase in Russian drone strikes, the use of guided aerial bombs, and missile attacks. He says that the initial work at the site of impact begins immediately, sometimes even at night, to clear debris and restore essential services such as heat, electricity, gas, and water supply.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5feuauhj5hpd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8fbbb9805707d72af38d66b931275d50fd8d6b6\n\nHe reveals that the city authorities are actively expanding their network of shelters. Currently, Sumy has equipped around 300 shelters, with additional ones undergoing repairs, documentation, and approval by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (Ukraine’s fire and rescue service – ed.), gradually increasing their number.\n\n# “As for our overall strategy, we’ve chosen to invest specifically in defence.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dn9g7zil5hpd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ab256b1e65bffa5e4546effd9f9c3a1953069da\n\nOleksii admits that in 2022, the military administration took a more superficial approach to equipping shelters due to the urgency of the situation; to quickly increase the number of shelters, they simply cleared out basement spaces. Now, local authorities are intentionally allocating part of the budget to construct shelters that meet necessary requirements, such as ventilation, generators, heating, water supply, and sewage system. Those attached to schools or hospitals are equipped to continue teaching or providing medical care without having to wait until the end of an air raid.\n\n“For instance, \\[during an air raid\\] the maternity hospital continues providing consultations with patients in the shelters. They have the necessary equipment, and it’s even possible to deliver babies there, which has already happened. The same applies to other healthcare facilities. In other words, the shelters serve dual purposes. The same goes for schools: it’s impressive to see how entire classes are organised \\[in the shelter\\].”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vc4nvl2n5hpd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f714885b0fbc784550ed610f90228de7591d0baa\n\nThe hospital shelter also contains properly equipped operating rooms, adds Valentyna.\n\n# “We realise that people we accommodate are not simply Sumy residents but patients in need of care, and emergencies can arise at any moment. […] There is a large supply of medication, the capability to accommodate bedridden patients, and all the necessary conditions to ensure that people feel not only safe but also as comfortable as possible.”\n\nValentyna refers to the shelter as a “small medical state” capable of providing a wide range of medical assistance. Deputy Mayor Stanislav Polyakov states the general strategy for medical facilities is making shelters as autonomous as possible. As of mid-2024, this goal has been achieved almost everywhere, with two more shelters currently in the final stages of completion. The local budget remains the key source of funding for such projects; however, some facilities have been renovated with targeted financial assistance from the state budget.\n\nStanislav mentions that representatives of the Sumy local government visited Borodianka (a Kyiv suburb heavily damaged during the early stages of the full-scale invasion – ed.) to learn from their experience of working with international partners, including Lithuania. They now plan to construct a shelter at an educational institution with the same partner, replicating the approach used in Borodianka.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 938th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

    "selftext": "Anastasia Trofimova, who previously produced \"documentaries\" for Russia Today (also known as RT - the russian state propaganda arm whose staff were indicted for clandestine manipulation of western social media earlier this week), has debuted her new film *Russians at War*.\n\nFilmed in occupied Ukraine during russia's illegal invasion, it depicts a Kremlin-approved perspective on the russian army's activities and gives a platform to the same ahistorical lies that seek to legitimize russia's genocide of Ukrainians.\n\nIn producing the film, Anastasia Trofimova spent months in Ukraine while living with the russian army, which she (laughably) claims was not sponsored by the russian state.  Even the existence of the film itself, which debuted at the Venice Film Festival, has the effect of legitimizing the filmmaker's own long list of crimes in violation of Ukrainian law.\n\n**This reputation laundering propaganda was co-produced by Canadian taxpayers: $340,000 of the film's budget was provided by an organization that receives public funding.**\n\n*Trofimova's statements during the press coverage of the film:*\n\n&gt;\"They start to fight because they lost someone. And it's maybe a question of revenge.\"\n\n&gt;\"I didn’t go there with prejudgement.  Of course, I had all these stereotypes in my head that I got from reading Russian and Western media.  But I didn’t judge.\"\n\n**A soldier in the film openly denies the accusations that russian troops are committing war crimes.  Trofimova says that she \"did not see any such crimes.\"**\n\n&gt;\"I think in Western media, that's what Russian soldiers are associated with at this point, because there were no other stories.  This is another story.  This is my attempt to see through the fog of war and to see people for people.\"\n\n*Coverage:*\n\n* [\"Do the Russians cry too?\" Russia Today propagandist's film screened at the Venice Film Festival](https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/09/6/7473743/)\n* [Film Schedule at the Toronto International Film Festival (screening Tuesday)](https://www.tiff.net/films?schedule)\n* [Documentary ‘humanizing’ Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine sparks outrage at Venice, Toronto film festivals](https://kyivindependent.com/documentary-humanizing-russian-soldiers-fighting-in-ukraine-sparks-outrage-at-venice-film-festival/)\n* [Ukrainian Canadian Congress: Why is Canadian taxpayer money being used to fund Russian propaganda?](https://www.ucc.ca/2024/09/06/why-is-canadian-taxpayer-money-being-used-to-fund-russian-propaganda/)\n* [Canadian organization excuses their funding of the russian propaganda film in naive statement that film was not approved by russian state](https://www.ucc.ca/2024/09/07/ucc-responds-to-tvo-statement-on-russian-propaganda-film/)\n\n*A screening is scheduled for Tuesday, 9/10 at the Toronto International Film Festival.*",

That wasn't a dig at the US, it's just one of the downsides of being America's hat.\n\nThis propoganda film was partially funded by the CMF, through one if it's grants. That makes me angry, and there needs to be an audit done of how that happened.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the CMF hands out more than $380m in funding a year (of which this piece of shit film only received $340k), and is kept at an arms length from the government. Canada has free and independent media, and government officials are not allowed to be a part of the CMFs funding decisions.\n\nSo saying that Canada \"funded and thereby endorses\" this gross film is, at best, a misrepresentation.\n\nI'm betting the filmmaker misrepresented themself when applying for the CMF grant, and that was compounded by the board who looks over the grant proposals shitting the bed on their due dilligence. Worst case scenario, a board member or two deliberately greenlit a film they knew to be Russian propoganda and they should be fired. They should honestly be fired either way.\n\nBut again, no government official was involved in the process. Our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is a *trainwreck* of a politician.

The Canadian Media Fund is significant to funding Canadian produced content. Shows like This Hour has 22 Minutes, Hudson and Rex, Murdoch Mysteries are part of their funding. It's all listed and audited on their website.\n\nThe person escaping scrutiny is the producer, Cornelia Principe, who knows what government grants to apply for to receive funding. Trofimova was used because she qualifies for cultural funding as a Canadian. Cornelia Principe is no slouch in this manner. Her last documentary film she produced was \"To Kill a Tiger,\" which was nominated for an Oscar (coincidentally, it lost the award to \"20 Days in Mariupol\"). She has worked long enough in the film community in Toronto to know which programs to apply for funding. Her name attached to a project can influence the decision to approve funding.\n\nCornelia Principe used Trofimova's eligibility as a \"Canadian\" film maker to apply for funding from the Ted Roger's Fund, Canadian Media Fund, and other organizations that put the project in motion.",

        "body": "The organization (Canadian Media Fund - CMF) that provides the funding almost certainly had no idea that the funding was going to be used to produce a ruzzian propaganda piece.  Most likely the applicants lied and misconstrued the purpose of the film.  Canada is a very strong supporter of Ukraine not just from the Feb 2022 invasion but has been providing military and financial aid to Ukraine since 2014.\n\nCMF is a non profit that receives money from both the federal govt and industry, and its purpose is to seed both media and digital software production.\n\nQuite plainly, the organization funding mechanism was abused.  This has to be recognized and reasoned discussion should acknowledge that fact and not construe that CMF deliberately set out to fund a ruzzian propaganda piece.\n\nCanada is a democracy which places a high value on equitable conduct and freedom.  Furthermore virtually all of its principles of governance operate on the premise that participants are forthright individuals of good intention, morals and ethics.  The average Canadian deals with others on the basis that they will act reasonably and responsibly.\n\nBy the standards of most Canadians the last 10+ yrs have seen a very rapid change in how people interact, particularly in respect of more widespread duplicitous behaviour.   And quite simply the trust based foundation of most aspects of Canadian life have not kept up with this change.  This has evidenced itself several times recently in Canadian politics and media.\n\nAnd although Canadians like I abhor the misuse that is occurring the question comes to mind: do we wish to change our systems to become more suspicious and operate intrinsically of the premise that the applicant is lying and deceitful?  What level of additional controls have to be implemented to perhaps arrive at a new \"happy medium\"?\n\nIn my mind the issue is that if we have to change our society due to the actions of illicit individuals then in one context thee enemy has won.\n\nruzzia works hard to exploit the holes in ideals that free democracies cherish. All are now aware from revelations in the last week that ruzzia is devoting significant resources into propaganda and media influencing (despite the fact there have been repeated warnings over the last decade).  Exploiting good intentions of organizations such as CMF is just a wee little aspect of ruzzia's objectives.  Every success and the blowback assists in chipping away at trust in government institutions - and that breakdown in trust is ruzzia's ultimate goal, as then it leaves the whole of society weakened.\n\nSo don't be a victim to these goals of the enemy ruzzia.  While we seek to find ways to put a stopper on ruzzia's efforts understand the intent instead of blaming the victims.  Otherwise you just play right into enemy's goals, which are eradication of all the democratic principles we in the west cherish.",

There was nothing in my original comment that was \"triggered or defensive\" but rather information about the organization that provided the funding, and in the grand \"Discussion\" context thoughts about ruzzian propaganda, its goal of inciting attacks on democratic mechanisms and the importance of looking beyond headlines for understanding.  I would think your a trumper for this nonsensical reply to my comment but for the fact I know you are a staunch Ukraine supporter.  \n\nI provided such \"Discussion\" after reviewing the other comments at the time I made my remarks, as it was clear some felt this might have been a deliberate act by CMF, that some thought CMF is a govt entity (it is not) and few were examining the motives that underlie the real intent of ruzzian propaganda - the message of the film is just the surface.\n\nNow if more complex critical thought about goals that are in fact very much a long arc issue is not to your taste (or perhaps understanding) that is regrettable.   As it is the long arc that is of the utmost importance here.  If one cannot see the forest for the trees then one is blind to all but what is in front of them.  And that is a critical mistake to make in context of opposing ruzzia.  They are definitively playing the long game and have been since well before this war commenced (2014).",

Following the liberation, the entire world witnessed the tragic consequences of the occupation. The footage from Vokzalna Street featuring the destroyed convoy of Russian military vehicles went viral, and evidence of destruction and torture brought by the “Russkiy mir” shocked people around the globe. The town has since restored its most damaged buildings and continues to recover from the Russian offensive.** \n\nDuring hostilities and occupation, over three thousand objects were damaged in Bucha’s community. Some were beyond repair and had to be demolished, and new buildings had to be erected in their place.\n\nIn addition to restoring houses and infrastructure, the town is working towards becoming barrier-free and accessible for all residents. The war has increased the number of people with disabilities, necessitating providing them with an opportunity to live and work on equal terms with everyone else.\n\nAs part of the “Restoration” project, together with inclusion consultant Uliana Pcholkina, we will spotlight the restoration efforts in the Bucha community, showcasing contributors involved and outlining the tasks that still need to be completed.\n\n**Accessibility is a live issue**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7877qw2dphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1be8b5b400759d7ce79d1b96b14c6788cf5b76e\n\nUliana Pcholkina is a consultant on inclusivity at the Superhumans Rehabilitation Center and an activist for the rights of people with disabilities. She lived in Vorzel for a while and now resides in Bucha. When the all-out invasion began, Uliana and her husband Vitalii chose to stay home in Bucha. They decided not to evacuate and instead helped to organise community life, drawing on their expensive volunteering experience since 2014. In the first days of the invasion, pharmacies and stores in the town ceased operations, forcing residents to cooperate to meet urgent needs; the situation aggravated when electricity and communication were cut off. In early March, Uliana and Vitalii, both of whom have disabilities, left Bucha as part of an evacuation convoy due to increasingly difficult conditions in the town.\n\n# “I remember every courtyard, every bush where Russian soldiers stood, how they looked at us, aimed their guns, and how they searched us. \n\n# Those impressions are not something you easily forget. My mind didn’t want to erase these memories. That’s why I remember everything very well. Now, whenever I pass through Dmytrivka (a village nearby which the evacuation route passed – ed.), I get flashbacks every time.”\n\nThe couple settled in Lviv, where they lived for another year. There, they established a humanitarian hub. Upon arrival, they began connecting with volunteers and foreign partners to purchase essential items for people with disabilities. The hub provided incontinence products and assisted people with disabilities, as there were few adapted places for them to stay, and those that existed quickly filled up with newcomers.\n\n&gt;“There weren’t many shelters. There were some ad hoc solutions, of course, but it wasn’t common \\[to find a place\\] where a person in a wheelchair could live or stay. Many people cried when we helped them leave. They cried because they wanted to stay in Ukraine, but there was nowhere for them to stay… And people had to leave.”\n\nUliana and Vitalii worked on developing barrier-free environments for displaced persons while assisting people evacuating from the country. In the spring of 2023, the couple returned to Bucha, where they continued to elaborate on creating accessible facilities. Uliana now serves as a consultant on inclusivity at the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, addressing nationwide challenges. She also monitors changes within her own town.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f12pecfgphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4840bd3085fc799c18812709dc50d47c2cb58289\n\n&gt;“It is crucial for local authorities to properly allocate budgets and oversee the creation of accessible environments, vital for people with limited mobility. There is still much work ahead in Bucha. For instance, at an intersection, one side of the street has a large curb without a special ramp. The issue arises because part of the roads belong to the town, while another part of the intersection falls under the State Road Agency’s jurisdiction. The town claims it cannot modify the curbs because they are not its property. Therefore, there is a need to coordinate different services and ensure that all projects prioritise accessibility,” Uliana stresses.\n\nAccording to Uliana, progress is underway, and the authorities increasingly realise the importance of ensuring equal rights and opportunities for everyone. Local officials need to grasp the concept of accessibility, its necessity, and the ways to achieve it. Uliana explains that communication plays a pivotal role in this process.\n\n&gt;“We maintain open communication with the local authorities. There are many people here who care and want these changes. For example, even the chief architect initially didn’t understand what Vitalik (Uliana’s husband – ed.) was talking about accessibility and left the meeting dismissing the idea. But once he delved into the issue, he became our best partner-in-crime (ally – ed.).”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wuuk5v1kphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=352c1ca91b7a0d488f0112a0492587ee780e7d96\n\nEnsuring accessibility is especially critical for the country at this time. With a rising number of people — both military and civilians — having disabilities like amputations, musculoskeletal disorders, and other impairments, it is crucial to create conditions where they can fully live and work. Additionally, disability can affect anyone, even in peacetime. Uliana recalls her own car accident, emphasising that no one can guarantee they won’t acquire a disability at some point in their life.\n\nMany people perceive people with disabilities as incapable of fully participating in society, often overlooking them as potential employees. Uliana mentions a study conducted by her NGO, “Active Rehabilitation Group”, to illustrate her point. According to the results, 72% of respondents feel pity for people with disabilities. Changing this mindset is not easy, but creating comfortable conditions for people with disabilities can foster their better integration into society.\n\n&gt;“This issue will only become more relevant due to the war. We cannot afford to lose veterans, both men and women – people with disabilities and various impairments; we cannot afford to lose their economic potential. As Olga Rudneva (the head of Superhumans – ed.) emphasises, we are a country of people with disabilities. The number of such people will only increase because every shelling results in casualties and injuries. Many people are receiving lifelong impairments.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsjn9b2mphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a5c78b0bdc45ddaad19129f90031ae1b12f319d\n\nUliana emphasises that people with disabilities or other impairments are no different from anyone else. Providing them with opportunities to live and work will enable Ukrainian communities to achieve sustainable economic development.\n\nUliana notes that in Bucha, some facilities are already barrier-free. For example, the sports academy and the Administrative Service Center have already installed ramps and equipped restrooms, among other improvements. Despite some criticisms concerning these ramps and facilities, the complex is generally accessible to people with disabilities. Recently, a private swimming pool opened, and Uliana visited it herself. She noticed some flaws and suggested possible improvements to the staff. However, the pool can still be accessed by wheelchair users, and Uliana herself visits it.\n\nWhen designing or renovating buildings, it is crucial to consult with experts and thoughtfully consider the optimal placement of elements. Uliana references a recent example in Bucha, where a new residential complex in Bucha installed numerous ramps and handrails. However, all the ramps are built at steep angles, and some lead to curbs, making them highly inconvenient for users. Given shortages of accessibility experts, communities should monitor the installation of all necessary elements in buildings themselves. Whenever possible, citizens should avoid purchasing property in residential complexes that do not prioritise accessibility, thereby avoiding funding such an approach.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzo1nvpnphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a27297e14ecc73556b915ace821f5844f6c68c6\n\nAccording to Uliana, Bucha is progressing towards greater accessibility. The town council and hospital have improved accessibility, and more bicycle lanes are being established. Located near the capital with excellent transportation connections to Kyiv, Bucha has great potential to evolve into a truly comfortable town to live in. The focus of donors and partners on Ukraine’s reconstruction presents opportunities not only for Bucha but also for other towns across the country.\n\n**Vorzel ambulatory**\n\nVorzel, a village in the Bucha united territorial community, was also occupied at the beginning of the full-scale invasion, which resulted in substantial damage to residential buildings and infrastructure. While many facilities have been restored, reconstruction efforts in the town are still ongoing.\n\nThe local ambulatory was in poor condition before the attack. Restoration efforts commenced before 2022, but they were halted with the onset of the invasion. Following the de-occupation of Kyiv Polissia, restoration work resumed, and by September 2022, the renovated ambulatory reopened, offering new services to clients.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wsd7ersphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d4c3689e896b4ef788068c825a10ebbab2a6bb4\n\nOksana Bruyaka, Deputy Medical Director of the Bucha Primary Health Care Center and family doctor, shared insights into the ambulatory renovation and services it now offers to local residents.\n\n&gt;“We have expanded services for patients with tuberculosis, and in 2024, we are actively beginning to focus on palliative care.”\n\nThe ambulatory also provides psychological support.\n\n&gt;“We can conduct counselling sessions even without a referral to a psychologist or psychotherapist. Ninety percent \\[of patients\\] can receive services right here, on-site. And in critical situations, when the family doctor is unable to handle the patient, we can refer them to a psychologist or psychiatrist,” says Oksana.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggo1098wphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2b4c6512b48fdd7cdb2e8921bf995c498b108c9\n\nIn 2023, the ambulatory introduced the practice of scheduling patient appointments for preventive examinations, not just when they are ill. Individuals in the high-risk group, namely those over 40 years old, are regularly scheduled for preventive check-ups.\n\nIn the ambulatory lobby, information stands display available screenings, along with QR codes linking to the institution’s website and social media profiles. These stands also contain links for leaving feedback on Google Maps or filling out a survey to provide comments or suggestions. Additionally, the ambulatory has an electronic portal where patients can choose a doctor and schedule appointments. There is a separate area for children waiting for their parents or their own medical consultation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9nlcrx1yphmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6061ea2f21b5c0ebed57f0045db644b51f52e458\n\nUliana Pcholkina, who visited the ambulatory with us, pointed out certain shortcomings that people with disabilities may encounter here, although overall, the building is quite accessible. It is equipped with ramps at the entrance to the clinic, allowing wheelchair users to enter. However, some challenges may arise in the lobby area; for instance, the registration desk, ticket terminal, and hand sanitizer dispenser are positioned considering the height of a standing person, which may be difficult for someone in a wheelchair to access. Nonetheless, the halls are wide, and the restroom is well-equipped and accessible to everyone. Despite these observations, the ambulatory generally provides a comfortable environment for all patients.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf5d10z0qhmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4694cd80fe81a656631117abd4896ec0a9c035ac\n\nSuch minor flaws are easily fixable. During the design phase, the principle of universal design can be adhered to, but the already existing facilities should be adapted to accommodate the needs of all citizens. This includes not only people with disabilities but also children and their parents, pregnant women, people with luggage, and those with temporary health impairments such as leg or arm fractures. Likewise, it is crucial to ensure informational accessibility by installing information desks and providing information duplication.\n\nUliana emphasises that her comments and advice are not meant for the sake of annoyance or unnecessary criticism but seek to encourage improvement and cooperation. She aims to inspire people to pay attention to these aspects during planning and construction processes.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zmbvrfj2qhmd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b14fd76a2f190e59b5c20f75aaade19888d29a28)\n\nFor this sake, there is a [guide](https://uaprogress.tech/resources/projects/barrierfree_guide_2.pdf) on accessibility that explains the principles of universal design, methods to assess spaces for accessibility, and strategies for reconstructing public spaces and areas around government and social institutions. It is crucial to educate people not only on how to create barrier-free spaces, but also on why it is necessary. Society must understand that people with disabilities are just like everyone else and deserve equal opportunities.\n\n&gt;“If, for example, an employer thinks that I should stay at home and receive treatment and even \\[if they\\] donate to medical centres but believe that I am incapable of working, then they will not make their business inclusive, accessible, and barrier-free. \\[Although\\] this person might even build a rehabilitation centre because they sincerely believe we need treatment. That’s why we need to change our perspective.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 923rd day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the war, Ukrainians are not abandoning animals in need. They rescue pets, often risking their health and lives. Activists regularly undertake rescue missions to the areas affected by Russian shelling or temporary occupation to evacuate animals. One such organisation, ZooPatrul, has transformed from a volunteer initiative into a fully-fledged organisation, running two veterinary clinics and a European-style shelter within just one year.\n\nThe issue of stray animals existed in Ukraine long before the full-scale war. Unfortunately, it often went unnoticed and unaddressed. Shelters were frequently overcrowded, and the culture of responsible pet ownership was not well established. It is still not uncommon for newborn pets to be abandoned by their owners or even discarded by animal breeders.\n\nThe suffering of animals has been exacerbated by the full-scale war; due to hostilities, many pets are left without homes or proper care, face danger, or often lose their owners to Russian shelling. The research conducted by the Save Pets of Ukraine initiative reveals that the number of frontline animals under volunteer care has increased by 60% as of February 2023. In comparison, the number of animals in shelters has doubled over the same period. Most animals sheltered during the full-scale invasion are pets abandoned by their owners during evacuation. In response to this crisis, animal protection organisations in Ukraine are actively working to provide aid.\n\nFor instance, the Kharkiv-based NGO Animal Rescue has been aiding pets for seven years. Initially, the organisation focused on rescuing abandoned and injured animals in Kharkiv. However, with the onset of the full-scale invasion, the initiative expanded its operations and now carries out animal rescue missions in war-affected areas.\n\nAnother major entity, the Kyiv Animal Rescue Group (KARG), has been operating in the capital since 2014. Initially launched as a private initiative of two volunteers, Mykhailo Storozhuk and Liubov Kravchuk, it has since grown into a public organisation dedicated to rescuing animals. KARG has been active since the beginning of the 2014 Russian invasion and expanded its operation following the all-out war. For instance, during the spring of 2022 alone, the team made six trips to the frontline city of Huliaipole, located only seven kilometres from the contact line. Earlier, we covered one of these trips to the town.\n\n[ Photo: Vitalii Poberezhnyi. ](https://preview.redd.it/agc0ooa8lamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbe11d3ee45ede95002577deabcf34640ff48802)\n\nMany Ukrainian animal protection organisations are adapting to the current challenges. The ongoing war has significantly impacted their operations, shifting their focus to animal rescue efforts. For instance, UAnimals, a humanitarian movement founded in 2016 to combat animal exploitation in circuses, has redirected its efforts to help animals affected by the war since. Their activities now include evacuating animals from the combat zone, providing food and medicine, and rebuilding shelters.\n\nMeanwhile, some organisations were created specifically in response to the full-scale war, driven by the urgent need to address the emerging crisis. ZooPatrol is one such initiative.\n\n**Merging the creative industry with animal protection**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2d5ydjiblamd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47ceea8ee99029bfa277be8e71a7d7fbaa85b0e2\n\nZooPatrul started its activities on March 3, 2022, in the second week of the large-scale Russian invasion. Launched as a temporary initiative of three dedicated volunteers, the organisation initially focused on rescuing animals trapped in apartments across Kyiv and its suburbs, as their owners had to evacuate during the rapid Russian advance. By the first anniversary of their volunteer work, the team had opened a shelter in Irpin (a Kyiv suburb, that endured a month-long Russian occupation at the beginning of the full-scale war – ed.), established a patrol service for rescuing stray animals, and set up two veterinary clinics in Kyiv. Additionally, their volunteers regularly conduct humanitarian evacuation missions to de-occupied and frontline areas.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00i8r2kalamd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ae319735ef8dd14e9dfd7581c5181bfec07fe08\n\nThe organisation’s founder, Dmytro Revniuk, recalls that the full-scale war found him and his pregnant wife in Kyiv, where they decided to stay. A few days later, an acquaintance who was in another city and unable to return reached out to him.\n\n# “She asked me to rescue a dog that had been left alone in her locked flat. Fortunately, I was able to save the dog. At the time, I realised the situation was not unique. Many people had fled in a panic, and their pets could be left alone, locked in their homes without food and water. I posed on social media, offering help in such cases. On the very first day, the post was shared 7,000 times, and within the first three days, I received around 800 requests for pet rescues.”\n\n[ Photo provided by heroes. ](https://preview.redd.it/kauye0ydlamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b322125fb8598f9d606964753322a01d9745abc9)\n\nDmytro and his friends initially assumed they would quickly process all the requests and return to their everyday lives. However, upon closer examination, they realised they could do more to help animals affected by the war and the negligence of those who had abandoned them. The founder of ZooPatrul believes that a key factor in the initiative’s development to its current state was the team’s lack of prior connection to animal protection. This allowed them to view the situation from an outside perspective, assess the pros and cons of current efforts in Ukraine, learn from the experience of foreign counterparts, and ultimately develop the best solution.\n\n&gt;“Before the war, nearly everyone on the future ZooPatrul team worked in creative fields like film, advertising, video production, or media. I worked as a producer and owned a production company creating commercials. While I continue advancing my career in this field, animal protection has become a vital part of my life.”\n\n**How ZooPatrul gets animals back on their paws**\n\nAccording to Dmytro, in 2023, ZooPatrul was recognised as one of Ukraine’s most effective animal protection initiatives, according to the global animal rights organisation PETA.\n\n&gt;“We rescue and treat animals in Kyiv and the surrounding cities. We also conduct evacuation missions in Donechchyna, Slobozhanshchyna, and Prychornomoria. Sometimes I’m amazed at how we manage to accomplish all this during the war, but we’re trying our best. We have a fantastic team and strong support from the public, for which I am deeply grateful. I think people support us because they see the tangible results of our work, particularly how we put their donations to use.”\n\nIn the first months of the full-scale war, ZooPatrul received $52,000 in donations from concerned individuals. Dmytro mentions that the volunteer team decided to invest this money in building the first European-style animal shelter in Ukraine, which was constructed in Irpin.\n\n&gt;“We are doing everything we can to ensure this shelter doesn’t become just another ‘concentration camp for animals’ but a convenient and comfortable place. We have drawn inspiration from our colleagues in Germany and the Czech Republic, and I am pleased with our progress so far. We’re not planning to stop here. Even after the shelter opens, we have plenty of plans to keep improving it. We also want to expand our evacuation missions to the newly liberated areas. Currently, we only have one vehicle that can transport food, cages, and animals, so we are actively looking for more transportation options.”\n\n[ Photo: ZooPatrul's Facebook page.  ](https://preview.redd.it/97tnf9yklamd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e9d7f86dd2c7adf95d48ad3827193051e35875)\n\nThe ZooPatrul hotline receives about two dozen calls for help every day. In some cases, veterinarians offer advice over the phone. The organisation also provides information about animal adoption and answers various questions, including those related to evacuation. Doctors care for pets at the ZooPatrul veterinary clinic in Kyiv by examining, treating, and vaccinating them. Dmytro says their top priority now is treating severely injured and seriously ill animals.\n\n# “The most emotional moments in our work are when we save animals that were considered hopeless. We’ve had several cases where people thought some cats or dogs would never walk again, but our doctors helped them recover. It’s heartwarming to see videos of these animals running around with their new families. On the other hand, the hardest part of our job is when we can’t save an animal despite doing everything we can. You can never get used to that.”\n\n[ Photo from ZooPartul’s Facebook page ](https://preview.redd.it/oyq17jeulamd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34b705d73f4616cc8e2d7cb00348289ba0e83de3)\n\nIrena Skakun, the manager of ZooPatrul, says that despite her ambition to save all animals in distress, she sometimes has to turn down requests because of limited resources – whether it’s a lack of space in the clinic or shelter or not having a vehicle available to respond quickly.\n\n&gt;“It’s very challenging because we realise the level of responsibility we have. People can get upset, aggressive, and lose their temper with us. It’s unpleasant, but we know we are doing our best and are always looking for ways to improve.”\n\n[ Photo provided by heroes. ](https://preview.redd.it/g7vrbdbylamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6c50e172c1b258db5177a826b2a614c4fd12c31)\n\nDmytro shares that in March 2022, they received about eight hundred requests for animal rescue. At that time, there were only four people on the team.\n\n&gt;“To rescue animals from locked apartments, we had to cut the hinges off the doors, make holes in walls, and climb through balconies. Soon enough, many dedicated volunteers joined us. Our largest team was during the evacuation of animals from the newly liberated towns around Kyiv – we had 24 patrols, each with two people per car. Later, some of these volunteers returned to their regular routines. Now, we have a small but strong team.”\n\nIrena explains that establishing effective communication allowed ZooPatrul to build a large social media community that aids its operations and supports its efforts.\n\n&gt;“Sometimes, when you feel burnt out and exhausted, reading comments where people thank us and offer support can lift your spirits and push you to do more and do it better. Nowadays, making a real impact is not just about doing what you think is right – you also need to share it publicly and not shy away from presenting yourself and your work.”\n\n[ Photo provided by heroes. ](https://preview.redd.it/drq0xha1mamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4200913242ce610e0cea60ca0808905c2a702c3d)\n\nAn essential part of ZooPatrul’s work involves evacuation and humanitarian missions to the newly liberated and frontline areas. In March 2022, they started with Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, and Borodyanka (Kyiv suburbs that were occupied at the onset of full-scale invasion and liberated by April 2022 – ed.).\n\n“We received passes to evacuate the animals and distribute food. The animals greeted us eagerly in the first few days, climbing onto our cars and into our arms. A similar situation happened during the liberation of Izyum in Slobozhanshchyna (Izyum was liberated in September 2022 after six months of Russian occupation – ed.). We were among the first responders, seeking permission from local authorities, providing food, and rescuing the animals in need. We also travelled to Sivershchyna with American volunteers and visited frontline towns in Donetsk Oblast. Our next trip took us to Zatoka in Prychornomoria, where the resort town had been heavily shelled, leaving many animals abandoned. ZooPatrul managed to evacuate some of them and left food supplies. We then travelled to the Kherson region after the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station was destroyed.\n\n[ Photo provided by heroes. ](https://preview.redd.it/s01wkit3mamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d98a7df2f316d386a24e1f81396e236d1b64608a)\n\n**Helping animals properly**\n\nDmytro advises those involved in animal rescue and protecting their rights just to take the plunge and start.\n\n&gt;“There is no perfect time or opportunity to start. What matters is motivation and willingness to put in the work. Sure, you will face many challenges along the way, and you need to be ready for them. But you will always find the necessary resources when you’re doing something you truly believe in.”\n\nNataliia Shevchuk, a volunteer with ZooPatrul, suggests that anyone willing to help animals should start by rescuing and finding a home for at least one pet.\n\n&gt;“Abandoned animals end up homeless. There have never been enough volunteers to go around, but now, during a full-scale war, the need is even greater. If each of us adopts just one or two animals, it would make a huge difference – a very significant difference.”\n\nAfter finding an abandoned animal, Nataliia recommends taking it to the vet for necessary treatment. If you cannot keep your pet, she advises against taking it to a shelter due to overcrowding. Animals in shelters often face cramped conditions and lack of exercise, food, and warmth. She also warns against giving homeless animals to places where they will end up on the chain and to organisations that neglect proper adoption rules.\n\n[ Photo: dodomy.ua Instagram page ](https://preview.redd.it/d683ldc7mamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6921c1a23573402753c361fc5c7a8460cb4b93f3)\n\nNataliia believes that finding a responsible adopter for a rescued animal is the best option. This person should realise the importance of sterilisation and regular vaccinations for the animal, and commit to following these procedures. Additionally, they should install anti-bug nets on the windows and ensure that the animal is not allowed to roam freely, as this can make it vulnerable to accidents, predators, getting lost, or contracting diseases.\n\nAccording to Nataliia, potential pet adopters should be aware that animals require a balanced diet – not table scraps or cheap, low-quality food – and proper veterinary care. Adopting a pet is a significant responsibility, and adopters should be prepared to invest time and money in its care. Nataliia suggests using social media and targeted advertising to find responsible adopters.\n\n&gt;“One effective option is to post in themed groups that focus on finding homes for animals, such as “Dodomy”. It’s important to include attractive photos of your animal. You can find excellent examples of both photos and captions in these groups. Also, consider asking your friends and acquaintances to repost and reach out to influencers. With persistence, a few out of 50 requests will likely yield positive results.”\n\n[Photo: dodomy.ua Instagram page](https://preview.redd.it/6uzuxpuamamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30e1b9832e93dba1a853d0397610b3b88e6268f6)\n\nMost European countries don’t have specific legislation requiring pet sterilisation. However, in Spain, adopters are required to sterilise cats to control their birth rate. Similar legislative initiatives exist in Denmark, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, where local authorities cooperate with animal rights activists to address this issue. The countries that have successfully managed the stray animals issue have typically done so through sterilisation laws or awareness campaigns supported by animal rights organisations.\n\nNataliia explains that, in theory, a pair of cats and their offspring can give birth to about 420,000 kittens in 7 years, while a pair of dogs and their offspring can produce about 67,000 puppies in the same period. This underscores the importance of sterilising not only pets, but also stray animals in your neighbourhood. Modern surgical methods make the sterilisation process humane, allowing to address the overpopulation of stray animals in Ukraine efficiently.\n\n&gt;“When you breed your pets, you always run the risk that their future owners may not be so responsible, only adding to the issue. If people are truly responsible, they should consider giving a chance to a pet from a shelter or off the street and break this cycle of cruelty. There aren’t enough loving homes for all the pets in need.”\n\n[ Photo provided by heroes. ](https://preview.redd.it/g9jtjqvdmamd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc03a5104977a391722e52b144f3c0f3d7a3854)\n\nBesides the danger posed by shelling, thousands of animals in Ukraine are under threat due to the Russian terrorist attack at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station (On 6 June 2023, the Russian troops blew up the occupied Kakhovka dam, causing massive flooding – ed.). The flooding affected numerous animals besides pets. For instance, a deer got stuck in a yard in the village of Antonivka, eight kilometres from Kherson, and had to be rescued – unlike many similar stories, which didn’t have a happy ending. Despite the scale of the challenge, Ukrainians came together to help these animals. The ZooPatrul team travelled to Kherson to evacuate the animals and support local communities. With the help of colleagues and volunteers, they managed to evacuate about 200 animals. ZooPatrul veterinarians examined the rescued animals, provided initial treatment, and nursed them back to health.\n\n# “ZooPatrul’s mission is to rescue, treat, rehabilitate, and rehome animals. The adoption department meticulously reviews applications to ensure that animals are placed in loving and responsible families,” reveals its founder.\n\n[ A small deer was rescued in Antonivka after being swept away by the explosion of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station: a screenshot from the video.](https://preview.redd.it/70frr2rgmamd1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fda78d9ad284f061ecaa773b35a6bad3a626e7f0)\n\n If you want to support ZooPatrul, you can contact them through their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/zoopatrul.ua/) or [website](https://www.zoopatrul-clinic.com.ua/tvaryny).

I ran a rescue and some places we took cats from they had 2-3 cats a year or two prior and despite losing many to illness they had 40-100 cats all because of the lack of neutering. Many people opt to shoot or kill them by other means and refuse to neuter so they don’t “run out of cats”. Ukraine is going to have a ton of cats and I’d imagine a lot of the rebuilding will be apartments which tend to have 0-2 pet restrictions rather than small homes.",

Director Taras Spivak conducted such research to create *Under the Sign of the Anchor*. In this film, he aimed to construct an alternative version of history where the Cold War did not end. Spivak satirises the Soviet army and military-industrial complex (or “war machine”) and what remains of it while simultaneously illustrating how frightening and absurd it can be. Under the Sign of the Anchor is based on archival materials from the times of the USSR’s collapse and the early years of Ukraine’s independence, focusing on the Kyiv Higher Military-Political School and the “Kyiv” Soviet aircraft carrier.\n\n[ Frame from the film Under the Sign of the Anchor.  ](https://preview.redd.it/wgy3gbagcwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b52acad9b4380343e39d79b9b0dce9597cfed5e7)\n\nAs a director, Taras says that he would like to see more similar films in Ukraine. Working with archives has many advantages and makes documentary filmmaking more accessible. This is especially important in times of war, when searching for life’s meanings is still necessary, and major resources are directed towards supporting the army.\n\n“Archives are such a quick entry into this (documentary filmmaking — *ed*.). \\[…\\] In this sense, archival and montage filmmaking in general has a very convenient economy as a method of organisation. It’s often inexpensive \\[…\\] because it can be done without the efforts of dozens of people, unlike live action filmmaking, which requires hundreds of people. And it can be very impressive, very effective in what it does.”\n\nTaras also believes that it’s not just about having more interest in archives, but also caring for them responsibly. While archival filmmaking can be inexpensive, preserving and restoring film quality can have significant costs. Taras and his friends found the material for Under the *Sign of the Anchor* in the attic of the National Film Archive of Ukraine (formerly known as Kyivnaukfilm/Київнаукфільм). During the summer of 2021, the director catalogued 12,000 film reels that were stored in inadequate conditions.\n\n[ Frame from the film Under the Sign of the Anchor ](https://preview.redd.it/dz3xqy3lcwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd92561484c00c5a722c3c0f4a64adae2d73c436)\n\nAnother reason for Taras’s decision to work with archives is that he doesn’t want to speculate on the theme of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Ukrainian society cannot yet distance itself from this reality, so the ways in which it is documented naturally evolve. For instance, Taras notices that journalists are increasingly using wide shots of mutilated bodies and other consequences of the war instead of close-ups.\n\n“I understand those documentary filmmakers very well because I’ve also seen the documentation of horrors. And I have only one thought about them. If this documentation aims at some kind of fight for justice, if they serve as legal evidence, then it makes sense indeed. But if it’s about personal ambitions or artistic intentions and so on, I think it’s somewhat inappropriate.”\n\nTaras says it remains challenging to abstract oneself away from realities in order to live and comprehend them. In his view, working with archives helps us reassess the biases and perceptions of a specific historical period that we continue to carry with us:\n\n# “In the future, after dismantling the structure currently known as the ‘Russian Federation’, we will have both the right and the privilege to claim these archives. For our history, for the history of our ancestors.”\n\n[ Frame from the film Under the Sign of the Anchor ](https://preview.redd.it/39r7epoocwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ed6b34d826deab1d670f907563bddb496b377e)\n\nDespite limited funding and other challenges, Ukrainian documentary films are increasingly making their way to international film festivals. These films speak not only to Ukrainians, who share a common trauma, but also engage Western audiences who may not be as familiar with the realities of armed aggression. In March 2024, Ukrainian film director and war journalist Mstyslav Chernov and his team received Ukraine’s first Oscar in the Best Documentary category for *20 Days in Mariupol*. This film depicts Russia’s siege of the city in February-March 2022.\n\n# Such victories provide a platform to counter Russian propaganda, showing the world that Russia remains imperialistic by nature and continues to perpetrate genocide.\n\nDirector Oksana Karpovych works within this context, using intercepted conversations between occupiers and their families in her film *Intercepted*. The film is accompanied by footage from de-occupied Ukrainian cities and villages. It received two awards at the Berlin Film Festival: the Special Prize of the Ecumenical Jury in the Forum section (for artistic quality and addressing religious, social, and humanitarian issues) and a Special Mention from the Amnesty International jury.\n\n[Full frame from the film Intercepted \\(2024\\)](https://preview.redd.it/owkzdmexcwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccb72966a45101c3131ca093345372d91177f48e)\n\n# During the premiere, international audience members often questioned the authenticity of the recordings.\n\nSome people claimed the director cooperated with the Ukrainian special services and intentionally distorted reality. However, Oksana Karpovych maintains that she approached the material primarily as a film director and aimed to show this Ukrainian reality to foreigners. She emphasised that some participants in the recordings were identified.\n\n“My position as a film director is transparent,” says Oksana. “I acknowledge (and declare in the film) the nature of these recordings. I also understand that their online publication for a wide audience was part of Ukraine’s information war. \\[…\\] Everything we hear in these recordings corresponds to the reality we live in.\n\n# In Ukraine, we don’t need intercepted communications to know that the Russian army kills civilians, rapes women and children, loots, and uses prohibited weapons – we already have plenty of documented testimonies and evidence of this.”\n\n[ Frame from the film Intercepted \\(2024\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/coxwx044dwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7e0334d85df7c12a4732f313586c6a48bf61520)\n\nDespite the audience’s prejudice, Oksana Karpovych observed that her film did influence the audience, prompting them to view Russia from a new perspective distinct from its cultural propaganda or diplomatic ties.\n\n“*Intercepted* raises a series of questions that perhaps the German audience hadn’t considered before,” she says. “It addresses the awareness of ordinary Russian citizens, the overall standard and quality of life in Russia, the hierarchy of their army, the culture of looting, even the nature of the Russian language and its relevance to what is happening. Making people in the West talk about Russia in the context of violence and imperialism rather than just ‘ballet’ is an achievement for me.”\n\nThe different stages of Russian aggression are a significant theme in Ukrainian documentary filmmaking, but they aren’t the only one. Such films can also serve as acts of activism and portraits of genius (*Infinity According to Florian*‘ by Oleksii Radynskyi), requiems to the 1960s through the fate of a couple (*Ivan and Marta* by Serhii Bukovsky), or quests to find one’s own place in the world (*Elevation* by Maksym Rudenko). The premiere of the latter took place at the Docudays UA festival.\n\nMaksym Rudenko began work on his film long before the full-scale invasion. He met the main character, Vasyl, during the filming of his previous feature-length film, *A Portrait on the Background of Mountains* (2019). Vasyl is a ski jumping coach who found his life’s purpose. Maksym didn’t want this man’s story to be lost, so he decided to dedicate a separate film to it.\n\n“This is not just a story about ski jumping; it’s about how important it is to find your place in the world and pursue your calling. The main character embodies this message 100%. He knows he’s doing what he’s meant to do. It’s such a unique case that I tell through this character, about the power of choice in life.”\n\n[ Frame from the film A Portrait on the Background of Mountains ](https://preview.redd.it/504luspadwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3857e9e1ec6251251fc78d2b8f3c94e7d81b5e78)\n\nThe director and his team went on expeditions to the Carpathian Mountains over five years. To capture the life of the coach and his trainees realistically, Maksym and Vasyl lived in the same room, attended training sessions together, and communicated constantly throughout the day. The protagonist was open to the camera and almost ignored it. Due to his close bond with the coach and his desire to depict as much as possible, editing the film was challenging, admits the director. Additionally, each frame involved a lot of physical work — equipment could sometimes be carried up to 25 kilometres in the mountains. In such cases, according to Maksym, editing directors who are not involved in the filming can help better identify the strengths and weaknesses of the material. The whole team plays a crucial role in documentary filmmaking:\n\n“Everything depends on the team in documentary filmmaking. Sometimes, it may be a very simple shoot, just some interesting idea, but the team can develop these ideas to such a perfect state that it becomes a great film. Because filmmaking is always about both the idea and how it’s executed.”\n\n[ Frame from the film A Portrait on the Background of Mountains  ](https://preview.redd.it/dnb5ss4ddwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fa6c9fd8588f71802199a2d5556de3639e5809)\n\nMaksym has noticed that the global film industry has grown tired of war. Initially, international festivals rejected his film *Elevation* due to its peaceful subject matter, but now the situation has changed — the Western film community wants to see pleasant images. For himself, the director has decided not to film about the war right now (the events are too vivid), but to go and fight. He calls on his colleagues to join the ranks of Ukrainian defenders.\n\n“Now is not the time for art, but the time for war, at least for men,” Maksym says. “I don’t understand men who are filming something now. Those who know the military situation, they know that our country is one step away from \\[the threat of ceasing\\] its existence. If everyone here doesn’t come together, there won’t be any country left.”\n\nMaksym doesn’t know if he will continue his career as a documentarian, but he wants to show *Elevation* to audiences. While watching the film, it is difficult to clearly identify if it stemmed from a specific initial idea. As often happens with documentary films, the meanings are mostly shaped during editing. In this case, during filming, the director was motivated not by a final idea for his own work, but by his impressions of another film by a Lithuanian director about a woman living in the mountains.\n\n“\\[…\\] Even when you think there’s nothing around to film, because the mountains are quite monotonous, you still understand that you are now shooting through a small hole with the camera, and then it will be on the big screen and there will be sound. I can’t say that I really wanted to know so much about sports, about this character. It’s research. You don’t know what will happen to him. It’s basically reconnaissance by combat. You don’t know if you’ll finish the film.”\n\n[ Frame from the film A Portrait on the Background of Mountains  ](https://preview.redd.it/ml5rergfdwld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7c8ccfe7af25926ef233e70af71e6768134cffb)\n\nThe future of Ukrainian documentary cinema is hard to predict, but it remains crucial for this art form to capture reality as it is here and now. Contemporary documentary cinema can speak about events that happened yesterday or a hundred years ago, explore personal or national themes, provoke discussions, and drive social change. Throughout its existence, the work of documentarians has been challenging yet essential, as it preserves reality — a particularly valuable task when many Ukrainian archives of past centuries are now in Russia.\n\n# Today, film crews continue this work under the conditions of full-scale war, often risking their lives. Therefore, the best support for them and for Ukrainian cinema in general is viewership.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 920th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

His father was Mykhailo Dubovyk, a renowned popular poet of that time, was arrested when Oleksandr was only 10.  His father was charged with pro-Ukrainian associations and engaging in a “counter-revolutionary” written exchange.  That same year he was killed by soviets and his family was not even informed of this until some time later.\n\nDespite being labeled as the son of a “bourgeois nationalist”, he managed to get a good education and following graduation his career quickly took off.  In 1958, he became a member of the National Union of Artists of Ukraine, and during that time he mostly worked in the \"realistic\" manner of soviet state-sanctioned art.  \n\nHe created beautiful portraits of his friends and family, many landscapes, and a compelling series of self-portraits.\n\n[\\(Left\\) Portrait of Mother, 1957 \\(Right\\) Portrait of a Somalian student, 1963](https://preview.redd.it/rzx58ld38old1.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=714b6bcd73fb5764731d3e0abd79e2ccd96bc534)\n\n[\\(Left\\) \\\\\"Surgery\\\\\", 1965 \\(Right\\) Portrait of Tetiana Holembiievska, 1963](https://preview.redd.it/aepts4mq8old1.png?width=1657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c95dfaa2f624d828f1ec326802f928cee3bceab)\n\nBut Oleksandr did not find it enough to fulfill his artistic expression, and his work also veered into wildly creative and beautiful territory.\n\n[\\\\\"Spring\\\\\" \\(1960\\) depicts the famous Chestnut trees of Kyiv](https://preview.redd.it/zoy9l4df9old1.png?width=976&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54295282eb676ff94fbaacbb805caf9c453d0aae)\n\n[\\\\\"Resting\\\\\" \\(1958\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4n1lzbq89old1.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4158a0f2625fe162e854428520bd824991ce2cc4)\n\n[\\(Left\\) Self-portrait, 1962 \\(Right\\) Fall, 1960](https://preview.redd.it/t3frtp02aold1.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eeb3ef3d5a72a1d104cbfbdd649ee7d229137ac)\n\nHe eventually took an alternative route by developing his own tradition he deemed “suggestive realism”.  Oleksandr worked hard to develop a personal system of symbolic signs and new allegorical and metaphysical languages.\n\n[\\(Left\\) \\\\\"Bouquet\\\\\", 1966 \\(Right\\) \\\\\"Lavra\\\\\", 1972](https://preview.redd.it/zc6r76muaold1.png?width=1937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27a3f26a397bbc670578211debf67f95bdb6a258)\n\nEach symbol has its unique meaning in his art; perhaps most notably, consider the \"bouquets\" which appear in so many of his works.  These shapes suggest a kind of keyhole to another reality - an entryway into another world.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# To Be Square\n\n[\\\\\"Signpost\\\\\" \\(1978\\)](https://preview.redd.it/483h1e4j6old1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a49088fecbd0a8ee33c9fe6168e0039af334952)\n\nWith time, Oleksandr completely did away with realistic painting in favor of simple geometric shapes and symbols like circles, squares and lines.\n\nInterestingly, his favorite shaped canvas is square... and he has a lot to say about that topic.  He says “it holds vast amounts of steady and serene energy.  When the balance is disturbed, the energy is unleashed in a dramatic event.  The square also easily absorbs changes in composition and at the same time keeps its integrity”.\n\n[\\\\\"Hieroglyph\\\\\" \\(1988\\)](https://preview.redd.it/45hix7fx6old1.png?width=897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf0e4238aa16204ce299eac4ce13c3e47cf18a8d)\n\n[\\\\\"Flight in Space\\\\\" \\(1980\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qnz31jvt6old1.png?width=910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e1b0af1a5fdf277e32bca0353e0d55146f347bb)\n\n[\\\\\"Guests\\\\\" \\(1989\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xkvb3mz2cold1.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f8e23d2e4e60ab8ad7c66634762620763c2a13e)\n\n[\\\\\"Pendulum\\\\\" \\(1989\\)](https://preview.redd.it/5y4kdwjgcold1.png?width=914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4231850c17137f934dfc8e90130cae2fb669499)\n\n[\\\\\"Prophet\\\\\" triptych \\(1989\\)](https://preview.redd.it/lvr5vq2vbold1.png?width=2694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6926fff353d9d5e212cf886500830fdb77dee72)\n\nHis evolution luckily for him coincided with the *Thaw*, which brought a temporary and limited relief to artists.  But after this short-lived glimpse of light’s reflection, the period known as *Stagnation* soon ensued and Oleksandr, as an artist, disappeared from the public eye.  He took some jobs mostly working in print and monumental art, until his career took off again in the late 1980s.\n\n[\\\\\"Black Bouquet\\\\\" \\(2008\\)](https://preview.redd.it/invsb8u6cold1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=613cf1ea764846c3481e11df3715d415a70228ea)\n\n[\\\\\"Bouquet of Thorns\\\\\" \\(2005\\)](https://preview.redd.it/dmo04gq4bold1.png?width=1240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93173b4666a25ca545d14ed8e899e2087d458154)\n\nAfter Ukraine regained her independence, Oleksandr got the opportunity to travel abroad and show his art.  He held personal exhibitions in museums, exhibition halls and galleries in Ukraine as well as abroad.\n\n[\\\\\"Fallen\\\\\" \\(1990\\)](https://preview.redd.it/8npxb71jdold1.png?width=896&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1313b65020e5977afdcb2e02b90ebe8194e81b92)\n\n[\\\\\"Triumphant\\\\\" \\(1991\\), created shortly after Ukraine regained independence.](https://preview.redd.it/fk0cc0sebold1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d2d80af0252a18c451b1aa97d1afcb1eff09118)\n\nIn the middle of the 1990's, he created two monumental works – stained glass windows in the New Apostolic Church in Kyiv (1994-1995) and wall paintings in the chapel of Notre Dame des Anges in the commune of Berre-Les-Alpes in the surroundings of Nice (1996).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# “We are owners of our destiny”\n\n[The artist today.](https://preview.redd.it/j8uqpue0uhld1.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=023458f5e4414479ff8cfa5c33b85bab629a9a36)\n\nToday, Oleksandr still resides in Kyiv and he still is quite a character which perhaps is best illustrated in this story he told:\n\n&gt;As I was moving studios, from the studio near the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra to another studio in Obolon, I stood at a loss in front of numerous canvases that had to be packed.  I didn’t know where to store them... and I just despaired of having to drag all this somewhere again.  So I put them in a pyramid in the courtyard of the workshops and set them on fire.\n\nLuckily, his wife saw the situation and saved his work.  She probably packed it and moved them too, just to avoid another incident, though this is my own conjecture :)\n\n[Oleksandr received the \\\\\"National Legend of Ukraine\\\\\" award this month.](https://preview.redd.it/zbzc8msquhld1.png?width=1043&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29bf9c7b4da7878a48b175ce6bdc6b48d1dfec5f)\n\nThe 93 year old artist does nor feel despair when faced with Ukraine being under russian attack, nor when he endures frequent bombing where he lives as he shared in this interview from 2024:\n\n# \"Everything that is happening now is both a challenge and a fantastic opportunity.  We saw ourselves not as tiny ants, but as owners of our destiny.  \n\n# Our art, our way of seeing...

The director was accused of distorting reality, and the film was shelved. Due to “political shortsightedness and the use of nationalist motives”, *Sonata for a Painter* (1966) by Viktor Shkurin was also banned. This film depicted the life of Ivan Honchar, a collector of Ukrainian antiquities who turned his Kyiv apartment into a unique museum.\n\n[Ivan Honchar in his studio.  Source: Ukrinform](https://preview.redd.it/imp5412p6bld1.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c4e1b1fa3ebfebf1eca6435fb9aafa3871dc5c)\n\nThe creation of mini-documentaries was an important step in the development of documentary cinema during the Soviet era. These documentary features chronicled the construction and launch of large industrial enterprises and energy facilities, the development of villages, and urbanisation. These recordings were put together to make educational and enlightening newsreels that were later broadcast on television.\n\nA significant event in the world of documentary cinema during this period was the film *Kermanychi*‘ by Ihor Hrabovskyi, created in 1965 in collaboration with cinematographer Yurii Tkachenko. It tells the story of “bokorashes”, woodcutters in the Ukrainian Carpathians who would float lumber from mountain peaks down to valleys using the Cheremosh mountain river. *Kermanychi* received awards at prestigious international documentary film festivals in London, Leipzig, Oberhausen, and New York and became a valuable testament to a profession that was no longer passed down to the next generations by the early 1970s.\n\n## Ukrainian documentary filmmaking of the 1970s and 1980s\n\nThe rapid development of science significantly expanded the thematic scope and the number of films produced by the “Kyivnaukfilm” studio, which released scientific, educational, animated, and documentary films. Documentary filmmaker Felix Sobolev created a series of films showcasing various experiments, including *The Language of Animals* (1967),*Seven Steps to the Horizon* (1968), *Do Animals Think?* (1969), and *Me and Others* (1971).\n\nThe poetics of Ukrainian documentary cinema were developed by director Oleksandr Koval. Seeking to change the image of cinema as a tool of propaganda or moral instruction, he began to capture generational memories by filming individual people’s lives. *Malanka’s Wedding* (1979) is a psychological portrait of a woman from the World War II generation. Oh Dear, *These Guests Have Come To Me* (1989), directed by Pavlo Fareniuk with Koval as cinematographer, tells the story of a witness to the Holodomor of 1932-1933.\n\n[Frame from the film Discover Yourself by Oleksandr Koval](https://preview.redd.it/4q85ldy87bld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4113c6762986402efd711462b9055b4c9eccbc95)\n\nDue to the policy of glasnost, which allowed information to be publicly broadcast without ideological pressure, documentary journalism became more active. Ukrainian filmmakers returned to reflecting on traumatic periods caused by Soviet occupation. For instance, they created documentaries dedicated to the artificial famine of 1932-1933, including *33rd, Eyewitness Testimony* (1989) by Mykola Laktionov-Stezenko and *Under the Sign of Famine* (1990) by Kostiantyn Krainii.\n\nIn 1986, the Chornobyl disaster shattered the population’s remaining trust in the government. A group of documentary filmmakers led by Volodymyr Shevchenko arrived at the power plant 18 days after the explosion, on May 14, 1986, and spent nearly 100 days there filming in the most dangerous zones. Censors cut some scenes from the film *Chornobyl: Chronicle of Difficult Weeks*, but it still aired. The film not only covers the causes of the accident but also its preconditions, including the involvement of Soviet authorities.\n\n*Chornobyl: Chronicle of Difficult Weeks* was one of the first documentaries to systematically record the aftermath of the explosion. It covers the construction of the shelter structure, or “sarcophagus”, over the power plant; the pumping of liquid nitrogen into the burning reactor; and the evacuation of people from contaminated areas. \n\n**A month after the premiere, Shevchenko died from lung cancer caused by radiation exposure. In his diary, he wrote: “If someone tells me that if I hadn’t gone in, I would still have my lungs, I would immediately respond: I’d rather be without lungs than, like some, without honour.”**\n\nGradually, the “Critical School of Ukrainian Documentary”’ (1987–1995) was formed, including directors Serhii Bukovskyi, Izrail Holdshtein, and Heorhii Shkliarevskyi. They expressed views on the inefficiency of the Soviet state system, social injustice, and mass democratic movements. A breakthrough for the school was Serhii Bukovskyi’s debut film *Tomorrow Is a Holiday’* (1987), which depicted the daily lives of workers at a typical Soviet poultry farm. It shows life in dormitories; a lack of basic amenities and comfort; and fatigue from monotonous state holidays, parades, and other rituals. The director filmed on state commission but also used the image of the poultry farm as a metaphor for the entire Soviet Union. Bukovskyi noted that this subtext emerged only after the editing process.\n\n## Ukrainian documentary cinema in the first decade of independence\n\nIn the crisis-ridden 1990s, documentary cinema became a way to search for identity, rediscover history, and grasp new social values. The difficult situation of the film industry during this period was linked to a lack of state support and the absence of legislation for private film production. Despite these challenges, high-quality works were still produced. In 1993, the *Unknown Ukraine* documentary series was created, involving 68 directors and 50 cinematographers. Each episode recounted a specific historical period, from ancient times to the achievement of independence.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the influence of television grew as it began commissioning and broadcasting documentary films, leading to a proliferation of documentary series. In 2003, Serhii Bukovskyi created the War. *The Ukrainian Account* documentary series about World War II events in Ukraine. Later, in 2006, he directed the film *Spell Your Name*, where he interviews people who survived the Holocaust in 1941-1942. American director Steven Spielberg served as executive producer.\n\nIn parallel, the younger generation of documentarians was honing their skills, eventually taking leading positions in Ukrainian cinematography. In his debut documentary exploration titled *Songs of the Forgotten* (2000), Volodymyr Tykhyi delves into the issue of identity among Ukrainians resettled to the Far East between 1882 and 1914. The only thing connecting these people to their ancestors is Ukrainian songs. Similar themes of exploring people’s roots appear in Valentyn Vasianovych’s first short documentary, *Old People* (2001). Films dedicated to the events of the Orange Revolution included Oles Sanin’s The Seventh Day and Serhii Masloboishchykov’s *People from Maidan. Nevseremos!* (2005).\n\nIn 2005, Ukraine received its first Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival for the short film *Wayfarers* by Ihor Strembitskyi. The film, which was Strembitskyi’s graduation project at the Karpenko-Karyi Kyiv National University of Theatre, Cinema and Television, depicts the daily life of a neuropsychiatric hospital near Kyiv. Despite the film’s success, it did not secure a prosperous career for the director. Amidst the industry crisis, Strembitskyi, like many of his colleagues, turned to work in television.\n\nAmong the most resonant projects in Ukrainian television documentaries at that time were two investigative series by the 1+1 TV channel: *Uniform of Brutality*, which exposed abuses by law enforcement agencies, and *White Robe Negligence*, which highlighted corruption within healthcare institutions. These documentaries led to official investigations and the dismissal of local government officials.\n\n[Screenshot of the cover of one of the episodes from the Uniform of Brutality series.](https://preview.redd.it/upil2sfl7bld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c0a37ad40386b5ec96d7bbcb8dd50e19e567ad)\n\nThe early 2010s ushered documentary cinema into a lethargic state: independent documentary projects remained in prolonged development, while television documentaries often received insufficient funding and airtime. For the 20th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence, Serhiy Bukovskyi created the documentary TV film *Ukraine. The Starting Point*, which closely traces the events of three years in Ukrainian history, namely 1989, 1990, and 1991, when Ukraine finally won its independence.\n\n## Documentary filmmaking in Ukraine after the Maidan Revolution\n\nUkrainian documentary filmmaking on the Maidan became a form of civic activism. This genre was created by artists who filmed the events of the revolution daily and shared them on social networks. The “Babylon’13” Ukrainian documentary filmmakers’ association was formed at the end of November 2013. In their manifesto, they proclaim: “Our main task is to show the birth and first decisive steps of civil society because the latest events in the country primarily indicate the formation of a new civic consciousness among Ukrainians, centred on self-organisation, solidarity, and the defence of natural human rights.”\n\nAccording to the documentarians, the generation of Ukrainians shaped during the period of independence was the driving force behind the formation of a new civil society. They saw documentary filmmaking as a way to spread ideas related to important social reforms and create a community of like-minded individuals.\n\nFrom December 2013 to January 2014, members of Babylon’13 created dozens of short documentary videos, including *The first moments of the assault on Kyiv city hall*, the Battle on Hrushevskoho Street series, Brick by brick, and more. 2014 also saw the release of the first comprehensive artistic interpretation of the events, titled *Euromaidan: Rough Cut*. This work was based on materials from a whole group of documentarians: Volodymyr Tykhyi, Andrii Lytvynenko, Kateryna Hornostai, Roman Bondarchuk, Yuliia Hontaruk, Andriei Kisielov, Roman Liubyi, Oleksandr Techynskyi, Oleksii Solodunov, and Dmytro Stoikov.\n\nThe confrontation with Russia and the awakening of national consciousness created a demand for documentary interpretation. Films about the Revolution of Dignity emerged, such as *Winter on Fire’* (2015) by Yevhen Afinieievskyi and the documentary series Winter, that has changed us by Babylon’13. There were also documentaries about the occupation of Crimea, including *Whose Crimea? The Holiday of Annexation* by Kseniia Marchenko and *Crimea as It Was* by Kostiantyn Kliatskin (2016).\n\nDuring the initial stages of the Russo-Ukrainian War, documentarian Leonid Kanter filmed the critical documentary *War at Our Own Expense*. This work highlights the inadequate provisions for soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine (at the time, the director was fighting in its ranks). Later, Kanter made the film *The Ukrainians* (2015) about the members of the Ukrainian Volunteer Corps and the defenders of Donetsk Airport. The filming of the defence lasted two weeks, and the film’s final phrase became famous: “People endured, it’s the concrete that didn’t.” In 2018, Kanter and his frequent co-director Ivan Yasniy created a documentary portrait of Vasyl Slipak in their film *Myth*. Slipak was a world-renowned opera singer and soloist of the Paris National Opera who left the grand stage and gave his life defending Ukraine.\n\n[Frame from the film Myth](https://preview.redd.it/kqq8gp9q7bld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30572f161bc9c243042b4b0be37af120cef01aec)\n\nAs a result of prolonged military actions, the themes of documentary cinema have expanded. Films about volunteering in the ATO zone have emerged (*Brothers in Arms*‘ by Serhii Lysenko), as have sketches about life in the frontline areas (*The Earth Is Blue as an Orange* by Iryna Tsilyk, Terykony by Taras Tomenko, *The Distant Barking of Dogs* and *A House Made of Splinters* by Simon Lereng Wilmont) and stories about soldiers during and after their service (*Company of Steel* by Yuliia Hontaruk, *War Note* by Roman Liubyi).\n\n## Ukrainian documentary filmmaking today\n\nMore new thematic directions in Ukrainian documentary cinema have begun to emerge since the start of the full-scale invasion. In the *Fortress Mariupol* documentary series, director and co-founder of the Babylon’13 collective Yuliia Hontaruk focuses on the return of military personnel to civilian life, the rehabilitation of fighters from the Azov Brigade after captivity, and the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n[Frame from a film in the Fortress Mariupol documentary series.](https://preview.redd.it/x40ejt1y7bld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d528a4612a4fc3a6ee5fd2bd2b9cdbb828cd0e1f)\n\nCo-founder of Babylon’13, director, and screenwriter Volodymyr Tykhyi crafted a duology where key events unfold over a single day in different regions of Ukraine with different protagonists. The two films are titled *One Day in Ukraine*‘ and *Ukrainian Independence. As It Is’*. Roman Liubyi experiments with form in his hybrid documentary *Iron Butterflies*, combining elements of live action and documentary to reflect on the experience of war. Kornii Hrytsiuk’s work explores and decolonises the history of eastern Ukraine, such as in the film *Eurodonbas*.\n\n[Poster for Kornii Hrytsiuk’s film Eurodonbas. Source: State Cinema Agency \\(Держкіно\\).](https://preview.redd.it/8x0sodpg8bld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=855779f4f811c59ed766ded47f364153af4f6030)\n\nDocumentaries depict the war in its various manifestations, from personal reflections to the experiences of entire cities, as seen in Mstyslav Chernov’s film [*20 Days in Mariupol*](https://www.ukrainer.net/movies-about-war-in-ukraine/). Directors show the consequences of war through portraits of civilian victims in films such as Anastasiia Tykhа’s *Our Robo Family*, Dmytro Hreshko’s K*ing Lear: How We Looked for Love During the War*, and Alisa Kovalenko’s *We Will Not Fade Away*. Many directors also aim to connect the experiences of this new stage of the war with previous ones, such as the Antiterrorist Operation (ATO) or [earlier](https://www.ukrainer.net/russian-wars/) Russian or Soviet hybrid operations.\n\nThese stories are often based on the artists’ personal experiences. For example, in *A Picture To Remember*, Olga Chernykh explores the power of memory and how it helps us cope with reality. Olga grew up in Donetsk in the 1990s, then moved with her parents to Kyiv. Her grandmother remained in Donetsk, and after the initial Russian occupation, the full-scale invasion only intensified Chernykh’s sense of distance between herself, her grandmother, and home in general. However, it was during this time that the director was able to create a new form of film, a project she began working on in 2019.\n\n*A Picture To Remember* depicts how three generations of women perceive war. The film is based on video conversations between Olga, her mother, and her grandmother, as well as on photos and videos from her family archive. In 2023, it opened the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA), the world’s leading documentary film festival.\n\n[Frame from the film A Picture To Remember.](https://preview.redd.it/b827oofm8bld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85f648be10d2fd5f785e5b8c11a39802591f32ad)\n\nOlga believes that changes in the industry should come primarily from Derzhkino and the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy. In addition to greater popularisation of the genre, financial support should also be prioritised. Olga says that documentary filmmaking in Ukraine is currently a non-profit endeavour, mostly relying on state funding. However, she finds additional sources of support and continues to film.\n\n“In reality, when you make films (both documentary and live action), it’s a form of therapy for yourself. On the one hand, it’s very traumatic because if you work with some kind of trauma, you re-traumatize yourself every time \\[…\\]. But there is also a healing aspect. \\[…\\] I love documentary filmmaking because of this empathy and love that is often present there. But I also don’t do enough of it, and it’s often lacking in our cinema. It doesn’t depend on countries, it depends on directors, on how they do it.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Join us next time for Part III!**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 917th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

The need to film events on the Maidan, particularly the crimes of the security forces of the then-president, and the rapid growth of national consciousness catalysed the development of young artistic associations and productions. Their work laid the foundations for a new era of Ukrainian documentary cinema, which continues to this day[.](https://imgur.com/a/ouxSKal)\n\nAs a result of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the demand for documentary films continues to grow. Ukrainian filmmakers document combat actions, chronicle civilian life, and share their families’ stories. They work with archives, exploring the experiences of previous generations. Simultaneously, film festivals in Ukraine are developing as platforms for finding audiences and sponsors. One of the largest is the Docudays UA International Human Rights Documentary Film Festival.\n\nIn this article, we look at how Ukrainian documentary filmmaking has changed over the past century and discuss its current state with young directors whose works were presented at the Docudays UA festival in 2024. These include *A Picture to Remember* by Olga Chernykh, *Under the Sign of the Anchor* by Taras Spivak, *Intercepted* by Oksana Karpovych, and *Elevation* by Maksym Rudenko.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# The origins of of Ukrainian documentary cinema\n\nLike in other countries, Ukrainian cinematography started with documentary chronicles. In 1893, Yosyp Tymchenko, an inventor from Odesa, created a mechanism that became a precursor to the cinematograph. To explore the device’s capabilities, he filmed two one-minute pictures: Spear *Throwers’* and *Horsemen*. However, Tymchenko’s invention did not interest entrepreneurs, and he lacked the funding to produce it himself. Since he couldn’t obtain a patent for the cinematograph, he focused on other scientific fields. Despite its revolutionary nature, his discovery did not gain the same popularity as the Lumière brothers’ cinematograph after 1895. Tymchenko’s apparatus was long part of the collection of the Moscow Museum of Applied Knowledge (now the Polytechnic Museum) under the name “The First Cinematograph for Filming, Printing, and Showing Films”, but its current fate is unknown.\n\n[ Yosyp Tymchenko. Source: Wikipedia ](https://preview.redd.it/10dw7k0624ld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53b0de0f9cb9365103514bc0ad0a9e845f1bca8e)\n\n**Kinetoscope:  A cathode-ray tube designed for reproducing television images. It is used in television receivers, monitors, indicators, and other radio-electronic devices.** \n\nA few years later, in 1896, Kharkiv photographer Alfred Fedetskyi created the first documentary film in the Russian Empire (which, at that time, occupied the territory of Ukraine — ed.). It was 1.5 minutes in length. From his window, he filmed a procession of Orthodox believers carrying the Ozerianska Icon of the Mother of God to The Pokrovskyi Monastery Cathedral in Kharkiv. This and other subsequent films by Fedetskyi were short in duration and had descriptive titles, such as *Cossack Horsemanship of the First Orenburg Cossack Regiment, Review of the Kharkiv Station at the Moment of Train Departure with Officials on the Platform, Folk Festivities on Horse Square in Kharkiv*, and so on. \n\n[ Alfred Fedetskyi. Source: polish-kharkiv.com.ua. ](https://preview.redd.it/c48jk2i824ld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8b39dbb7e6b1c2517cc874c7813a2b56c6a5331)\n\nUnlike Tymchenko, the documentarian succeeded in commercialising his work. His first public film screenings were held at the Kharkiv Opera House in December 1896. To advertise his photo studio, Fedetskyi organised film shoots and screenings, and he also conducted one of the first live-action film shoots in the Russian Empire — a magician’s performance on a theatre stage. Similar experiments with imagery were being conducted in France at the time by Georges Méliès, the father of live-action cinema — a type of cinematography built around the performances of live actors.\n\n## Development of newsreels in Ukraine\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, newsreel filming became common. This was because French film equipment companies Pathé and Gaumont viewed the Russian Empire as a promising market for films and equipment, as well as for providing cinematographic services. Photo studio owners, film entrepreneurs, and photographers became the first documentarians. Danylo Sakhnenko, a film mechanic and correspondent for the Pathé newsreel, began working in Katerynoslav (now Dnipro) in 1908. In early December, he filmed his first newsreel story, “The First Case of Cholera in Our City”. Between 1908 and 1915, Sakhnenko shot more than twenty documentary episodes in Katerynoslav. He is also considered the creator of *Zaporizhian Sich*, the first Ukrainian live-action film.\n\n[ Frame from the film Zaporizhian Sich. Source: gorod.dp.ua. ](https://preview.redd.it/klig219b24ld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65cae1812a18ee60b19f31bdb76b1f9b065c8028)\n\nAt that time, film content was already being censored. For example, the film *The Beilis Case* (1913), produced by Pathé, was banned in the cities of the Russian Empire. The film was about the scandalous Kyiv trial of Menachem Beilis, a Jewish man who was falsely accused of ritual murder.\n\nDuring the Ukrainian War of Independence (1917–1921), many newsreel recordings were made in Ukraine, often commissioned by various governments. During the year of independence of the Ukrainian People’s Republic (1918–1919), documentarians managed to capture several significant events, making films such as *Kyiv During the German Occupation* (commissioned by the Central Rada government), *Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi Attending a Prayer Service* in a Kyiv Church on the Feast of Saint Volodymyr (commissioned by Skoropadskyi’s government), *The Entry of the Directorate* (commissioned by Symon Petliura’s government), and *Burial of Young Heroes of Ukraine*. Under the command of Nestor Makhno, a Ukrainian political and military leader and well-known anarchist, the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine also had its own cinematographer.\n\n**The Ukrainian War of Independence: The key driving forces of this revolution were the Ukrainian people and their political elite, who applied ideas of political autonomy from the Russian Empire to the realisation of their own state independence. A national movement started developing in all regions of Ukraine. Ukrainian government bodies, political parties, and public institutions were created and operated, and culture was being revived. The revolution resulted in the establishment of the independent Ukrainian People’s Republic, which lasted until 1921.** \n\nAfter the Ukrainians’ defeat in the Ukrainian War of Independence, most of the territories of modern Ukraine became part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities considered cinema the most important of all the arts, as it could most easily convey communist propaganda to citizens without a proper education. Thus, documentary films became a form of official news information. In the early 1920s, films about the reconstruction of the country after the Ukrainian liberation struggles of 1917–1921 were popularised. Some of these films were titled *Restoration of Water Supply, Buildings, and Trams by the Odesa Provincial Communist Department; The Restored Jute Factory;* and *Revived Agriculture of Ukraine*. From 1922 to 1930, three film studios — in Odesa, Yalta, and Kyiv — operated under the All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration. These studios became the training grounds for a new generation of Soviet filmmakers.\n\n## The Great Avant-Garde in Ukrainian Documentary Cinema\n\nOne of the young documentarians who made a name for himself while working at these studios was Dzyga Vertov, an avant-garde director and the founding theorist of Ukrainian documentary cinema. In 1919, he created the “Kinoky” (Kino-Eye) association along with his wife, editor Yelyzaveta Svilova, and his brother, cinematographer Mykhailo Kaufman. The name was derived from the director’s belief that the camera is more objective than the human eye and can therefore better capture reality.\n\n[ Dzyga Vertov. Source: ikitb.knukim.edu.ua ](https://preview.redd.it/woe3zexj24ld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ce4a6e9d40561a3cce3f38a936829f334621039)\n\nTo create “pure cinema”, the “Kinoky” group rejected the influence of traditional arts such as literature, theatre, and music. Their platform for creative exploration became the “Kino-Pravda” party newsreel (1922), where young documentarians honed their artistic visions and practical skills. While producing 23 episodes chronicling the early years of the USSR, Vertov first employed techniques and methods that would later become integral to his cinematic language.\n\nIn 1927, after a conflict with “Sovkino” — the state joint-stock company that held a monopoly on film distribution in Soviet Russia — and accusations of formalism, Vertov moved from Moscow to Odesa. He completed Man with a *Movie Camera* at the Odesa Film Studio in 1929. This scriptless film-manifesto depicts a day in the life of a big city across six different episodes. For the filming, Vertov used experimental techniques such as animation, fast and slow motion, “hidden camera”, double exposure, and archival footage. *Man with a Movie Camera*‘ set standards in documentary filmmaking, editing, and cinematography and is still widely studied in film schools. Vertov shot his most outstanding films at the Odesa and Kyiv film studios, capturing Ukrainian realities of the period.\n\n**Formalism:  An artistic concept in which the value of a work is determined by its form rather than its content. From the second half of the 1920s in the USSR, where socialist realism prevailed, any experimentation with form was interpreted as formalism — a characteristic of avant-garde art.**\n\nAnother of Vertov’s fundamental achievements in documentary filmmaking was the creation of the first Soviet sound film in 1930, *Enthusiasm: (The Symphony of Donbas)*. This film captures the industrialization of the Donetsk region while also highlighting the struggle against religion, the elimination of illiteracy, and the nationalisation of enterprises. The soundtrack includes noise from industrial objects and the activities of people nearby. Charlie Chaplin, whose career was negatively affected by the advent of sound cinema, called *Enthusiasm* “one of the most moving symphonies I have ever heard”.\n\nIn the 1930s, the development of Ukrainian culture was curtailed, and mass repressions began. Studios in Ukraine started to be forced to operate under the “Soyuzkino” film association in Moscow.\n\n## Ukrainian documentarians during and after World War II\n\nDuring World War II, the USSR formed camera crews to document the main events at the front line and quickly relay them to newsreels. Over 300 documentarians joined the Soviet military. In addition to official reports on battles, Soviet film periodicals showcased combat and civilian life, the work of the home front, and the reconstruction of regions liberated from the Nazis. They also created themed issues dedicated to specific events or individuals, including partisan groups.\n\nIn 1942, to mark the anniversary of the so-called Great Patriotic War (a propagandistic term for the German-Soviet war — *ed*.), Ukrainian documentarian Mykhailo Slutskyi filmed One Day of War, involving 160 cameramen along the entire front line. The assignment for the film outlined specific scenes that needed to be captured: combat operations of various scales and involving different types of weapons, river crossings under bombardment, German aircraft flying in anti-aircraft fire zones, destroyed enemy equipment, and the process of bombing it. This film became more of a propagandistic interpretation of reality rather than an example of objective documentary filmmaking.\n\nThe most monumental documentary films depicting military actions on Ukrainian territory were overseen by famous Ukrainian director and writer Oleksandr Dovzhenko. By 1939, his portfolio included silent films (*Zvenyhora, Arsenal,* and *Earth*) and sound films (*Ivan* and *Aerohrad*). With his wife and assistant Yuliia Solntseva, Dovzhenko received a government assignment to film the Red Army’s “liberation” campaign in western Ukrainian lands that had been part of Poland. This led to the creation of the documentary film *Liberation*, which presented the Soviet occupation of western regions of Ukraine in a favourable light for the USSR. The film depicted portraits of hungry and impoverished children to support the thesis of cultural and economic oppression by Poland. Dovzhenko contrasted daily life in Soviet Ukrainian cities with the region under Poland, exploring the role of individuals in wartime and reflecting the character of the entire nation through the personalities of his characters. Influenced by Dovzhenko’s filmmaking, other directors subsequently created propaganda films such as *Soviet Lviv, Pearl of the Carpathians* (1940), and A*long the Soviet Danube* (1941).\n\n[ Oleksandr Dovzhenko. Source: Ukrinform \\(Укрінформ\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/1pjzg79x24ld1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383b912821bfad0e88dd0d1a5e3f81d1f35d08b3)\n\nThe documentation of the “reunification of brotherly Ukrainian and Belarusian peoples into one state” lasted for two months. The premiere of *Liberation* took place in 1940, but it was later withdrawn from circulation. This was most likely done to avoid reminding the population of the inconvenient truth about the Soviet Union’s collaboration with Germany to divide Poland according to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. A similar fate befell the film *Bukovyna, a Ukrainian Land*, which Dovzhenko co-created with Solntseva in her directorial debut. The plot tells how the people of Ukrainian Bessarabia and Northern Bukovyna began to experience a “better life” after the arrival of the Soviet army. The film serves as an example of Soviet documentary propaganda that manipulated collective consciousness and created a strictly positive image of the Soviet army and political leadership.\n\nThe pinnacle of Dovzhenko’s documentary-propaganda activity came with two films:\n\n*Ukraine in Flames* (1943) and *Victory on Right Bank Ukraine* (1944). While working on the former, Dovzhenko was also completing the screenplay for the cinema novel “*Ukraine on Fire*, which was later criticised by Stalin for its “anti-Leninism, defeatism, revisionism of national policy, and encouragement of Ukrainian instead of Soviet patriotism”.\n\n[ Frame from the film Ukraine in Flames by Oleksandr Dovzhenko](https://preview.redd.it/c7gqxfsz24ld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ba11ccf2ad0bf1ddcba854a52917fdb8248601)\n\nFor *Ukraine in Flames*, also created in collaboration with Solntseva, Dovzhenko served as artistic director and narrator. The film was edited from archival footage taken by 24 Soviet operators and video chronicles captured from Germans. Upon release, it was translated into 26 languages. Ironically, the English title of the film (*Ukraine in Flames*) serves as a bitter reminder of the war’s effects on Ukraine. The film largely avoids glorifying the achievements of the Soviet state, focusing instead on the suffering of the Ukrainian people during the war. It is a sound film enriched with Dovzhenko’s reflections and lyrical digressions.\n\n[ Frame from the film Ukraine in Flames by Oleksandr Dovzhenko. ](https://preview.redd.it/txy0az7234ld1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e00b44c14bb15145c955f3f84da89530355b38)\n\nIn *Victory on Right Bank Ukraine*, the narrative focuses primarily on portraying the USSR as the saviour of the Ukrainian people. Before starting work on this film, Dovzhenko collaborated with camera operators who had fought in partisan units. Based on their accounts, he produced *Compilation of Stories* in 1943 about the partisan movement in Ukraine. Dovzhenko was dedicated to preserving the historical memory of Ukraine’s involvement in the war and advocated for the establishment of a museum commemorating it.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1953, there was a sharp decline in the number of films produced in the Soviet Union. This was due to the post-war economic crisis, the repression of artists, and the “fight against cosmopolitanism”.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Please join us next time for part two, which will bring us through the 1960s up to today!**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 916th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

But as a preamble for this post, it's worth mentioning that Ukraine has around 42 million hectares of agricultural land that also sports some of the most fertile farm soil on the planet.\n\nCurrently, Ukraine supports the growth of food to sustain around a half-billion people, far more than its population of around 44 million - and, as the Atlantic Council puts it: \"Given the size and fertility of the country’s farmland, together with the vast scope for increased harvests and greater efficiency through ongoing modernization, it is no exaggeration to state that Ukraine can feed the world.\"\n\nAnd what could be more wonderful than fresh bread in this breadbasket?\n\n**Palianytsia** is a rustic, wholesome bread from Ukrainian cuisine that is pretty similar to the French *boule* and other tasty breads around the world.  Whereas *Korovai* is an important ceremonial bread (we wrote about that [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vktrfj/448_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_123rd_day_of/)), Palianytsia is more an everyday soul food. Depending on where you happen to be in Ukraine, it can be found in a few different forms, but perhaps the most iconic form is the one that is slashed across its side to make a happy crescent shape that promotes rising.  Palianytsia is believed to be very old - some people think that the word's origin comes from the root for *to burn,* but others believe it could be related to the ancient Greek word *pelanos* - a round bread that was offered to the gods.\n\nFor all these reasons, it's poetic that the word Palianytsia has become such a vivid symbol of Ukraine's heroic defense of a country with such beautiful farmland.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Rising to the Occasion\n\n[ \\\\\"Palianytsia\\\\\" by an artist known as Dyakiv \\(pen and coffee, 2022\\). The strawberries are a nice touch - find out why below.](https://preview.redd.it/8htxj2nbxwkd1.png?width=3849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=599acdd473c79ddccadedc03352e3ce9439fccbc)\n\n**Palianytsia** has become a popular challenge word - a *shibboleth* - used by Ukrainians who are trying to identify russian saboteurs and other species of invaders. In other words, it's a password. Using the word for a type of old school bread seems counterintuitive, but it's perfect because native russian speakers can't say 'Palianytsia' to save their lives. Sometimes literally, as it turns out.\n\nThis is due to big differences in the way the two completely different languages treat vowels. For example, O in Ukrainian is *always* an O - but in russian, O is very often pronounced like an A. And they basically can't say the 'tsya' diphthong properly at all. We wrote about the wide gulf between these languages in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/usspzl/505_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_85th_day_of_the/). Adding to the delightful confusion for the invaders, Palianytsia is quite similar to the Ukrainian word for strawberry, *Polunytsia*.\n\nIn the early weeks of the full-scale invasion, there were roving packs of russian saboteurs attempting to infiltrate Ukrainian cities - presumably in order to plant explosives, perform assassinations, etc. But it didn't really work; these jokers were getting caught left and right. One of the most straightforward ways that Ukrainians were using to quickly identify people who were caught snooping around, or out after curfew, was to ask them to pronounce Palianytsia. There is an especially funny video from February 26th that you may remember of an older Ukrainian, by himself, walking right up to a stranded russian tank crew and asking them, with a chuckle, to say Palianytsia.\n\n[Shibboleth chic](https://preview.redd.it/a00ry2pjxwkd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08eb5be6fcd4d604936bf0849816b338397c52bc)\n\nBelieve it or not, russian propagandists on their state television channels tried to make the case that this practice is discrimination against russian-speaking people.  In fact, one of the chief propagandists of the russian federation attempted to explain the Palianytsia phenomenon to her viewership and ended up not only failing to pronounce it, but she herself confused it for the word for strawberry.\n\nOops lol!  Looks like she would not survive long in Ukraine after dark.\n\n[Memes abound](https://preview.redd.it/mxl1wsvu5xkd1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aeca05a1ddd8008a4b824c9c49d13e78bfbdf1d)\n\n[ \\(Left\\) Say Palianytsia! \\(Top Right\\) Cute patriotic tattoo \\(Bottom Right\\) Playing cards.](https://preview.redd.it/9g7otslexwkd1.png?width=1766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd3c6adb586781eb9825877306a5f28c3d75a84)\n\nSo yes - Palianytsia has transformed from being just a homey kind of bread into a territorial defense practice, a meme and a cultural phenomenon that is a symbol of unity and resistance.  (Update for 2024!: and a new [long-range drone](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1f1378k/the_first_ukrainian_longrange_rocket_drone/))\n\nYou may have noticed that Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline like to keep it cozy by putting together some delicious homemade cooking...

This is from his fantastic English-language cookbook that was recently released called** ***The Authentic Ukrainian Kitchen***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 cups (400 g) all-purpose flour (plus some for dusting)\n* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n* 1 teaspoon kosher salt\n* 1 2/3 cups (400 ml) plain kefir, buttermilk, or plain yogurt\n* Vegetable oil (if kneading by hand)\n\n**Recipe**\n\n1. Preheat your oven to 400 F (200 C)\n2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicon\n3. In a bowl of your stand mixer, stir together the flour, baking soda and salt.  Using a spatula, fold in your kefir/buttermilk/yogurt.\n4. Mix everything together using a dough hook (or by hand) until a uniform and sticky dough forms - but avoid overworking the dough.  This also can be done by hand: start by mixing the dough with a wooden spoon, then lightly grease your hand with vegetable oil and knead it out.\n5. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.  Using lightly floured hands, knead until it becomes smooth and just a little tacky to the tough (about five minutes).  If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle it a little with flour as you go.  Keep adding flour until the dough is comfortable to work with.\n6. Form the dough into a roughly rectangular shape, flattening it lightly with your palm.  Then fold the upper corners of the dough rectangle down as if making an envelope.  Fold the lower corners up so they overlap.\n7. Flip the dough over so the seam is now on your kitchen surface.  Using both hands, lightly cup the dough and tuck the edges underneath, shaping it into a ball.  Rotate as you go.\n8. Transfer the dough ball seam side down to the prepared baking sheet.  Cover it up with a dry and clean kitchen towel and let it rest for about 15 minutes.  Then make an incision on the surface of the dough ball to let the steam escape while baking.\n9. Bake it in your preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until it is golden brown and baked through.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Смачного!\n\n**Part of our series on Ukrainian recipes!

This includes repairing the roof and preparing project estimates necessary to complete the restoration when peaceful times return.\n\n“It’s not a matter of complete restoration because the time is not yet ripe for this, but rather about the preservation,“ he says.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wn2ka35ciid1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d05946e7253cf883b99842b02643ab430f16f8d\n\nThe community covered part of the work at their own expense and also posted information about the People’s House on the DREAM platform \\[ a Ukrainian one-stop platform that links war-affected communities with potential donors and delivers transparent reports on every stage of Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction projects\\] to find partners for further restoration. In 2024, their contribution helped to launch a multifunctional shelter, hosting events for informal education (including chess club and workshops), cultural events, art therapy for internally displaced persons, and more activities. This was made possible because young people participated in the project “Human Dimension: Effective Governance through Data and Community Engagement”, funded by Canada. USAID provided the People’s House with a generator, allowing the facility administration to hold events during power outages, caused by the Russian airstrikes.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zapi7sr8ciid1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=169cf09a81344c9e3235973ec784f71812a6fe67)\n\nBefore the all-out war, the People’s House functioned as a venue for rehearsals and events. Today, it continues to fulfil this role, while also serving as a distribution centre for humanitarian aid to displaced people and military personnel. Ruslan points out that this was not the first time the building’s purpose had changed during wartime; during World War I, it was used as a hospital.\n\n“It is now experiencing its third war, and perhaps the true value of this house lies in its embodiment of unity. \\[…\\] Community residents know that if any aid is being collected for the soldiers, everyone should bring it to the House of Culture. In one case, we managed to collect a substantial amount of food from the entire Chernechchyna community in just half a day. Then we delivered it in a KAMAZ truck to the frontline for the soldiers of the 93rd Brigade, who were defending Okhtyrka in the first months of the \\[full-scale\\] war.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/os3vlh7aciid1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0750697cb92ed92b45e4320846b7055eca372b5\n\nAccording to Inna Novikova, the director of the local youth centre who is also involved in the restoration process, the building’s symbolism is further enhanced by the fact that it has served as a workplace for prominent figures such as actors Natalia Uzhvii and Amvrosii Buchma (prominent Ukrainian 20th-century actors – ed.), and writer Ivan Bahrianyi, best known for his novel Tiger Trappers.\n\n“And now, for the youth of Okhtyrka — I know this because I work mostly with young people — it is a kind of symbol, specifically historical, literary, and cultural. And if we talk about any cultural events and discussions, this work \\[by Ivan Bahrianyi\\] is always mentioned. It is very pleasing that the youth are interested in all this and are trying to popularise this history.”\n\n**The Chykalo Family Hotel**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs3rcfnfciid1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cc8f70bff776e17544d9f3c6e76092c51645968\n\nIn the 19th century, Oktyrka was home to the merchant and philanthropist Hryhorii Chykalo. Several buildings he funded have survived to this day, although their condition varies. Among them, is the Chykalo family’s guest house, which was once one of the largest buildings in the city, located at the heart of the city. Its two floors were constructed from stone: the first floor now houses a restaurant and a teahouse, while the second floor features rooms with a view of Rynok Square. The building, which was damaged during World War II, was later restored and repurposed as a garrison officers’ house. Today, it stands in disrepair, alongside many other local cultural sites. Local youth spearheaded the efforts to address this issue; among them is Vladyslav Liubarets, a cultural activist and representative of the community youth centre.\n\n“If you stroll through the city centre, it is an open-air museum, with nearly every building being a historic site. Most of them are \\[now\\] used as shops, shopping centres, and other businesses. Their facades are somehow preserved, though not quite as they should be.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3suunqcciid1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe153840628aa1412149bae84fb3eb2b84c72f4b\n\nVladyslav believes that the restoration of the city should encompass its cultural and historic sites. If not preserved, these landmarks may vanish, significantly impacting the city’s identity and perception. He considers the settlement’s image and historical character among the key factors why people choose to stay there.\n\n# “Individually, these structures may seem insignificant and unnecessary, but in reality, they shape the unique architectural face of our merchant city. Therefore, if we gradually lose such buildings, we will simply erase our memory.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aeezx7jgciid1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93d951ccaaf622224ad07b5c66a1c7336a99ed9f\n\nIndeed, even today, not all locals associate the building with Okhtyrka’s merchant history.\n\n&gt;“Okhtyrka’s residents have different memories of this building. Some remember going there for discos, others associate it with watching movies; some recall its beautiful spiral staircase, while others remember it as a ruin.”\n\nVladyslav hopes that one day, the Chykalo family hotel will be transformed into an art space and a recreational hub for youth. He also hopes that businesspeople who purchase such buildings with the intention of converting them into commercial properties will realise that their historical significance adds value that can be leveraged to their advantage.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 903rd day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Zgraya was among the organisations that brought together Ukrainians from different parts of the country. Founded in Kyiv during the [Revolution of Dignity](https://www.ukrainer.net/the-revolution-of-dignity/), it began operating systematically after the full-scale invasion, which turned volunteering into a matter of survival. Since then, its volunteers have been actively helping soldiers, civilians, hospitals, and even animals who are being rescued from the frontlines and provided with new guardians.\n\nTwo years after the full-scale invasion broke out, Zgraya is not simply operating but expanding its efforts. Since the release of our previous article featuring its efforts, this volunteer initiative has evolved into a full-fledged non-profit, significantly increasing the amount of aid provided. Moreover, Zgraya has expanded in new directions, opening its own medical centre in the Donetsk region, establishing a tailor shop at its headquarters, and launching medical evacuations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr43a5a4o4id1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=624702eaa1f15f7b1fc8271f24cca22befd4f217\n\n# Fulfilling military needs\n\nThe organisation has several priority areas, one of which is supporting the military. Zgraya has prioritised this focus since 2014. According to the organisation’s co-founder, Yevhenia Talinovska, the military needs account for roughly 80% of Zgraya’s total expenses. The organisation does not confine itself to a single focus and strives to meet a wide range of requests, from food to expensive equipment. In particular, it provides the military with ammunition, tactical medicine, personal protective equipment, toiletries, clothing, gear, and more. Zgraya volunteers also procure drones, thermal imagers, and vehicles they transport from abroad. According to the latest report published by the NGO in early May 2024, its volunteers have supplied the military with over 100 drones, 60 thermal imagers and night vision devices, and over 400 communication devices, such as radios, headphones, and satellite phones.\n\nIn spring 2024, Zgraya elaborated on opening a shop to paint the cars it donates to the military. During the war, cars are often considered expendable due to the risk of damage from shelling, yet they play a crucial role in safeguarding soldiers’ lives and health; in order to reduce their visibility to the enemy, all vehicles are painted in colours and patterns that blend with the surrounding environment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wratcl6o4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16a3a2dd55427021c3549e97226ad4dbddcd4554\n\nIn addition, Zgraya activities are closely linked to military medicine. After receiving the first ambulances, the organisation’s co-founder Oleksii Yudkevych, along with other volunteers, headed to the Donetsk region to conduct medical evacuations and provide stabilisation treatment for wounded soldiers. He managed to bring together a team of highly motivated people with backgrounds in general or military medicine, ready to enhance their skills and eventually provide assistance in evacuation ambulances or stabilisation points.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/naz5xkc8o4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8257e7d01ac24876fa850c718d76180cb26b255f\n\nDuring their six-month stay at the Bakhmut stabilisation point, the Zgraya mobile team served as combat medics and evacuation crew, driving off-road vehicles into the most challenging front-line areas without medical equipment. For a while, Oleksii has personally collaborated with a unit of the Special Operations Forces, a division of the Armed Forces of Ukraine tasked with particularly high-risk operations, such as raids behind enemy lines or creating intelligence networks. As of August 2023, his mobile group has assisted in stabilising and evacuating over a thousand soldiers and civilians.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5hwd2kz9o4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3aa8ea692f2d72e37f5c46048715693d60ffccb)\n\nOne of Zgraya’s latest projects is a tailoring workshop, launched in the summer of 2022 at the initiative of the volunteer Oleksii Sobchuk, who introduced the early samples of first aid kits. Since then, the first-aid kits have gone through several rounds of revisions and testing until the first batch of finished products filled with tactical medicine was sent to Sloviansk (a frontline city of the Donetsk Oblast in the east of Ukraine – ed.) in late June 2022.\n\n“Everything fits perfectly in it (the pharmacy bag – ed.); nothing hangs around. \\[Zgraya’s head of the medical department\\] Nastia and our doctors have designed the perfect set of necessary fittings for it,” shares Yevheniia Talinovska.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0ylpl4pbo4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1814944b40a71056fef5f9cdf5a612a425f940b0)\n\nZgraya’s first aid kits contain all the essentials soldiers require. The volunteers equip each unit with a certified medical tourniquet, bleeding control products like homeostatic and Israeli bandages, a decompression needle and occlusive dressing for chest wounds, a parapharyngeal airway with lubricant to restore airway patency, and more. Yevheniia points out that purchasing pharmacy kits is more expensive than sewing and equipping them in-house. The Zgraya kits are pretty spacious and do not concede to the factory-made equivalents. Based on the feedback from soldiers, the kits are designed for a quick one-hand release, which is crucial to swiftly providing first aid in critical situations.\n\nIn addition to first aid kits, the Zgraya tailor shop manufactures helmet covers and various pouches, including models designed for carrying medical tourniquets, ammunition, and grenades. All organisation’s products continuously receive positive feedback from soldiers, the Emergency Service, and critical infrastructure workers. Volunteers have already sewn and equipped at least 550 first aid kits and produced approximately 420 covers for helmets and other gear.\n\n# Humanitarian missions: How Zgraya Helps Civilians\n\nSince the onset of the full-scale invasion, Zgraya has been actively providing civilians – primarily refugees and residents of frontline cities – with medicine, clothing, household appliances, and food. One of their first major initiatives was the evacuation mission in Chernihiv, which allowed them to safely relocate over a thousand civilians out of the city.\n\nDuring the large-scale invasion, Chernihiv was among the first cities to be attacked and besieged by the Russian military. In March 2022, a humanitarian catastrophe struck the city; water, electricity, and communication were cut off, and enemy attacks razed a significant part of the city. Chernihiv residents were trapped in the city for a long time as the Russian troops blew up the bridge connecting it with the neighbouring settlements, including Kyiv. Civilians lined up for evacuation, and the number of civilians seeking safety exceeded Zgraya’s capacity by seven times—the lack of resources compelled the organisation to turn many people down. Yet, despite life-threatening circumstances, the volunteers continued coming to Chernihiv day after day to deliver humanitarian aid, evacuating as many women and children as they could.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/fxzechpeo4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69d49c90664adf1c2f4957cbcca057a1cf74f0d9)\n\nMeanwhile, in Kyiv, whose outskirts became a scene for heavy fighting early in the invasion, Zgraya launched an initiative assisting people with limited mobility. The team cooperated with volunteers to establish ten district-based chat groups across Kyiv. Once a week, they delivered food packages, medicines, and hot meals to residents who couldn’t go out shopping or prepare their meals. Yevheniia Talinovska recalls how Zgraya let the initiative live its own life.\n\n“We actually came up with it (the “Neighborly Delivery” initiative – ed.) not as a project, but as an idea long before the full-scale \\[war\\]. We wanted it to be a grassroots initiative, \\[fostering\\] good-neighbourly European values.”\n\nWhen the situation in the country’s north somewhat stabilised and the neighbourly initiative started operating independently, Zgraya began to travel to the newly liberated and frontline areas in Ukraine’s south and east, delivering humanitarian aid. In total, the volunteers have visited more than 200 settlements.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/eirqlr1go4id1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75cf0a0bac19f93553493da279f7498c89acd869)\n\nMoreover, during those missions, the volunteers found that as Russian troops began actively advancing in the Donetsk region, plenty of doctors had fled the area. Hence, the number of patients requiring medical assistance far exceeded the number of available specialists. That prompted the volunteers to mostly put military medical care on hold, prioritising civilian needs.\n\nRealising the great demand for medical care in the Donetsk region, in mid-summer of 2023, Zgraya opened several medical offices in the city hospital of Kostiantynivka, located 15 kilometres from the front line. Oleksii recalls that once the project was launched, the team encountered a challenge: few doctors were willing to move closer to the frontline and work there long-term.\n\n“If you happen to live in Kostiantynivka and have health issues, and your family doctor hasn’t yet left, you can call him, and he would say, ‘Come back in two years.’”\n\nNevertheless, the Zgraya team has found a solution: remote healthcare. This involves using technologies that allow doctors to consult, examine, and even treat patients remotely.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5hj49duho4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=440a3599f04391ddd562f511c9be4af956899cdb)\n\nSince Ukraine is just starting to advance in this area, the American startup ZiphyCare stepped in to assist Zgraya. The company has provided telemedicine stations – suitcases with various medical tools to examine skin lesions, conduct blood exams, or perform ultrasounds. This system enables doctors to see a patient from anywhere in the world. Oleksii notes that many medical professionals treating Donetsk residents are originally from Ukraine and currently reside in Israel.\n\n“The doctor is in Tel Aviv, the patient is in Kostiantynivka, and there is a third person involved; we call them ‘doctor’s hands’. This person is a telemedicine system operator who may not have a medical degree but is trained to work with the platform, assisting the physician.”\n\nAt the medical centre, individuals can receive free examinations, consultations and medication. By the end of February 2024, over 700 soldiers and civilians had already received qualified medical care in Kostiantynivka’s medical offices. Additionally, the health centre owns an ambulance to transport patients with limited mobility and those in serious condition to the hospital. According to Yevheniia, many elderly people in the Donetsk region need medical assistance but cannot reach the health centre on their own. Hence, the ambulance takes patients to the city hospital for examination and then brings them back home.\n\n# The reality of Ukrainian volunteering and the future of Zgraya\n\nAs the war continues, volunteers play a crucial role in strengthening Ukraine’s defence capabilities, filling in the gaps the state apparatus cannot adequately fill. Over the two years of the large-scale invasion, the demands covered by charities and NGOs have only increased. The explanation is simple: the Ukrainian military is not only defending its positions but also carrying out counter-offensives and engaging the Russian army in its rear.\n\nFundraising through donations has become increasingly challenging due to the protracted nature of the war and the extensive needs of both soldiers and civilians. This is why Yevheniia is considering expanding its audience by engaging people who are generally not interested in donations. How can this be achieved? According to Zgraya’s co-founder, the solution lies in creating a competitive, high-quality product that would appeal to donors not deeply involved in the war context. The simplest example is introducing merchandise.\n\n“Speaking in the context of growing charity and donation culture – this is one story and a long-term play. On the other hand, we currently have an opportunity to offer a quality product or service that people would purchase immediately. While they may not donate, they will buy from us and fund our activities.”\n\nIn addition to occasional giveaways, Zgraya accepts one-time and regular donations. Details and reports are available on the  \norganisation’s website.\n\nYevheniia believes that after the end of the Russian-Ukrainian war, her volunteer headquarters will have at least as much, if not more, work to do. Post-war recovery necessitates assistance in rebuilding destroyed cities and addressing the collective trauma experienced by Ukrainians. However, Zgraya will likely continue cooperating with the military, aiding veterans’ psychological and physical rehabilitation.\n\n“Rebuilding our country will be difficult because any major war is followed by a crisis period. Each region faces specific challenges, even regarding technical, human, and natural resources. This is why we broadly described the range of things we could elaborate on afterwards when we created our public organisation and were drafting its statute.”\n\nWhile the war remains in its active phase, volunteers must work with the military, whose lives often depend on the timely delivery of a drone or pickup truck, as well as with civilians in de-occupied and frontline areas. The Zgraya team relies on black humour to cope with stress. Yevheniia admits that if someone heard the volunteers’ jokes, they might think that they were “some kind of freaks”.\n\n“We are stressed, dumbfounded people with a rather strange sense of humour, a strange attitude to life, and restrained emotions. Once all is over, it will probably result in a long course of psychotherapy. Otherwise, we might come out of it completely fine, saying, “We have survived all of that – so okay, let’s move on with our lives.”\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/2we72pnmo4id1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f0ca9082cbc3fa322ad5f00f560ea12bccc886)\n\nYevheniia believes that nobody can know for sure when and how the Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression will end. Therefore, it is best to continue actively engaging in your work. To ensure your effort remains effective and efficient, volunteers should surround themselves with people who share similar values and work on projects that resonate with them.\n\n“Volunteering is pointless if you are not doing something that resonates with you. You burn out quickly, and a dead, burnt-out volunteer is bad. So, it is essential to engage in what you enjoy.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 901st day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

We have written posts much like this one in the past.\n\n[100 Days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/v3ok8o/450_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_100th_day_of/) | [150 Days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/w5sgjc/513_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_150th_day_of/) | [300 Days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/zqexfa/755_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_300th_day_of_the/) | [500 Days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/14trp3h/456_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_500th/) | [800 Days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1ciycc6/529_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_800th/)\n\nToday, on yet another milestone, we thought we would look back a bit at our own Reddit community.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEvery day for two and a half years I have adjusted the time of sunrise for the title of the next day's scheduled \"sunrise post.\"  Embarrassingly, there were a few times that I forgot to adjust this detail...  But the sun still rose all the same.\n\nSo why are we always talking about the sunrise in the sticky at the top of the sub?  Very early on in the invasion, someone in our community posted something that was so beautiful in its simplicity: \"The Sun is Rising Over Kyiv\" - a pic from a lonesome webcam that showed a defiant sunrise rising over the capital.  It went viral, and each day it seemed someone new would post their own \"The sun is rising over Kyiv!\".\n\nIt struck me that most of these pics were screenshots of webcams positioned all over Ukraine; it was wonderful to see so many concerned people who were monitoring Ukrainian cities from all across the world.  In its own strange way this may have been an apt metaphor for how the online community began to learn about Ukraine itself.  That outpouring of concern may have begun on a basic humanitarian basis, but soon the world began to learn more about who Ukrainians really are - all through the prism of online platforms like Reddit.\n\n[One of the images that was posted early in the full-scale invasion.](https://preview.redd.it/vcdemn7mkxhd1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8eb7df3765cd402f0217a48cbf1528a758f3253)\n\nThere were many comments each day saying that it felt good to know that Ukraine was still standing - and that they checked these sunrise posts on r/Ukraine the moment they woke up in the morning.  They also talked about how much they were learning about this mysterious European country that had for so long been obscured by russian appropriation and obfuscation.\n\nAs a mod team we realized that we could make the sunrise itself a daily part of our subreddit culture.\n\nOur mod team's concept for the series was from beginning a simple one: \"If people understand that Ukraine is a real country, with its own history, its own culture, they will want to help save it.\"  It seems like a whole other world now, but at the outset of the full-scale invasion it didn't seem that much of Reddit really understood that Ukraine was a real country; some even seemed a bit surprised that Ukraine would manage to stay strong and fight back.  I remember reading so much puzzled astonishment that Ukraine would even attempt to survive as a culture and nation under such overwhelming odds.  But anyone that was close to Ukraine knew what was at stake, and that there would be a fight.\n\nSince then, my writing partner u/Lysychka- and I have been writing these \"sunrise posts\" just about every single day; as of today we have turned in 550 posts about Ukrainian culture, history, places to visit, memories...  It quickly became a major part of our lives - each post took up eight hours to write, depending on the subject.  And of course I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the series has had other contributors during these 900 long days - our fellow moderators, for instance u/most_unseemly who has written 87 weekly Art Friday posts - and even some community members who have pitched in on a few occasions!\n\nAnd so this message is a love letter to all of you who have engaged with this content, absorbing it and learning just a bit more about Ukraine through our community on Reddit:  you are proof that all the hard work that goes into moderating this subreddit is worth it.  Please accept our sincere thanks to the gracious and cheerfully curious members of the r/Ukraine community.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Learning More About Ukraine\n\n# Today we would like to welcome new members of the community to learn more about Ukraine by visiting the r/Ukraine wiki.  Here you can find all of the culture posts categorized by subject:\n\n# [The r/Ukraine Sunrise Post Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/wiki/sunriseposts/)\n\nIt's worth mentioning that many of you are so dedicated to engaging with the sunrise posts each and every single day that maybe if you browse the wiki it would be more of a trip down memory lane for you :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOn this 900-day milestone we also wanted to look back and share with you some of our favorite sunrise post subjects.  We would like to invite you to explore:\n\nu/duellingislands favorite posts:\n\n* [Day 525: Folk song translation \"A Cuckoo Flew Over My House\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/15grqny/528_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_525th/)\n   * My favorite Ukrainian folk song, sung by one of the finest choral groups.  This song is so heartbreaking, it put me in such a melancholy all day while we made the video and translation.  In fact, I am melancholy once again hearing it now.\n* [Day 127: Queen Olha's Vengeance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vnwepd/450_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_127th_day_of/)\n   * For me, there are perhaps no figures from Ukrainian history more vivid than Olha, a queen of Kyivan Rus.  And I loved that this post dovetailed with a drone funding effort, as she herself all the way back in the tenth century used birds to burn down the city whose inhabitants had murdered her husband.\n* [Day 348: The Nizhyn Cucumber Monument](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/10vr0o4/724_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_348th_day_of_the/)\n   * It was fun to zoom in on something that is so local, but has so many interesting facets of community.  And I just love the monument :)\n* [Day 223: Vyshnyak, Cherry Wine](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/xv4tgk/702_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_223rd_day_of/)\n   * This food post is great because not only is the drink truly delicious, it has an entire scientific treatise custom-written by my writing partner's father, who is an old school homemade Vyshnyak tinkerer.\n* [Day 30: Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/tog8wo/550_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_30th_day_of_the/)\n   * This was the first \"high effort\" sunrise posts, where we turned the daily thread into a cultural deep dive.  Such a dreamy, exquisite movie filled with Ukrainian folklore, I hope you will check it out!\n\nu/Lysychka- favorite posts: \n\n* [Day 493: Khomutovskyi Steppe](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/14ni19k/504_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_493rd/) \n   * If life allows after the war, I would love to go there and see it for myself.  I heard about it and dreamt about it when I was a kid and listened to Ukrainian Kozak songs.  Writing this post and seeing the pictures made me feel so whole yet incomplete until I will lay in the grass of Ukrainian steppe, put my ear to the ground and will hear the whispers of [Kamiana Babas](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/weugzl/528_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_161st_day_of/), gallop of [Scythian](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/utiuea/504_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_86th_day_of_the/) horses, honest laugh of Kozaks around crackling fire, softs creaks of [Chumak](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1c8fjme/555_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_787th/) carts, and quiet voices of ZSU soldiers as they dream of their lives after the war.\n* [Day 791: Folk song translation \"Oh, the Chumak Traveled\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1cbm3gi/545_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_791st/)\n   * This is one of the posts that I had the most fun creating with u/duellingislands. As we worked on translation and the art, and putting it all together, wordsmithing, adjusting, selecting the images - I felt we know exactly what our vision is with this post and that we knew exactly what is the purpose of creating it, like so many of the posts before. \n* [Day 122: Pich, the traditional Ukrainian hearth](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vk40j1/447_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_122nd_day_of/)\n   * Pich is the heart of Ukrainian home and Ukrainian family. When I would visit my grandmother, I walked through several kilometers sometimes in rain and snow (as “thanks” to soviet occupation quite often there was no transportation available, especially in bad weather). And when we would finally reach her little old house (that still had corn husks as insulation on her walls) we would gather around her warm pich, drying out wet socks, hugging it to chase the chill from our bones. And then she would bring us some warm soup that was waiting for us in the belly of the pich. \n* [Day 43: The Battle of Kruty](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/ty3rmk/622_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_43rd_day_of_the/)\n   * This post for me symbolizes when I internalized that Ukraine will win. Remembering the resolve of my people, when they had zero chances and they still stood high and strong and refused to give up their freedom made it clear that today, when the world is finally a witness to what used to be hidden, Ukraine will prevail.  I love \"The hand of the Ukrainian soldier ripped the mask of russian face, showing its true image of misery, falseness and cowardice.\"\n* [Day 104: Domovyk](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/v6jgmm/448_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_104th_day_of/)\n   * I had to pick this one, because if I did not, my Domovyk would be very mad at me, and believe me, you do not want to live with a pissed Domovyk. In case it reads it - my Domovyk is the best, (please be nice to me).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Thank you all for taking part in this community!

I mean, the history and culture of the very seat of Proto-Indo-European language, come on! I remember the Orange Revolution (I was rooting for you) and then I never heard much more after that. It really was as though the world did not think of you as a real country. I myself called it THE Ukraine and now, when I hear somebody call it that I kinda want to punch them, but I only correct them instead, and if they are receptive, I explain what is wrong with that moniker. In any case, I am very happy to be part of this Reddit community, and I'm very glad to send the help I do. Unfortunately the guys I am sponsoring took a bad hit recently and we haven't heard from them since. They were alive and I just hope they still are. Every day, I cheer for your victories and every day I am pained by the terrible atrocities being done to you. And every day I am glad to see a sunrise post. Thank you.\n\nSlava Ukraini!

Especially with Ukranians invading russian soil while the russians are unable to do anything about it. I am loving every part of it.\n\nWhen putler took crimea I was 13 and I still remember being baffled by the fact he could just roll his tanks into crimea, claim it and call it a day. Then 10 years later with the renewed russian invasion my blood was boiling seeing all the footage of what horrible things the russians have done to Ukraine. The feeling of injustice and lack of international condemnation and support has stuck with me these past few years and I even had to stop following the developments as closely as I was at one point because I couldn't handle seeing the russians just getting away with their lies and terror day after day. \n\nNow I feel like we're seeing it all fall apart for putler and I couldn't be happier about it. It feels like justice is finally being served and there will only be more and more of it as time goes on. \n\nLastly I want to say I'm sorry that we as the EU haven't been more supportive. I deeply dread the cowardly withholding of support by our governing agencies. Everything you have received should have been sent earlier and in larger quantities if you ask me. But geopolitics are a nasty game, just so sad to see Ukraine is paying the price.\n\nPlease stay strong and keep going. Eventhough the international response has been lacking to say the least, there are still a lot of us who see what's truly happening and who are fully behind you all. We love you. Slava Ukraini",

The proximity to the Russian border does have an impact, but it should not be the determining factor in this issue, believe Okhtyrka residents, who keep developing urban vision of the city and preserving its historic landmarks despite the wartime threats.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# How Okhtyrka is Being Restored, part 1.\n\n[Okhtyrka ](https://preview.redd.it/ap1c33mjb4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8391ba2578afb6d2d0bb9af5aa127262befaacab)\n\nOnce, **Okhtyrka** was a village inhabited by Cossacks. As a legacy from this period, residents still refer to the city districts using the traditional division into sotnias, with ten sotnias in total. Later, Okhtyrka developed through crafts and trade, which left behind buildings in the historic downtown area. The new chapter in the region’s history is closely linked to oil extraction; the Okhtyrka oil district accounts for 50% of Ukraine’s total oil production, with the highest level of oil extraction reached in 1990. Additionally, Okhtyrka is notable as the birthplace of Ivan Bahrianyi, the prominent 20th-century Ukrainian writer whose works remain popular with contemporary youth.\n\nOkhtyrka is located on the border of Poltavshchyna and Slobozhanshchyna, equidistant from Kharkiv, Sumy, and Poltava. The town stood in the way of the Russian army during the full-scale offensive in February 2022. Despite more than a month of intense fighting, the enemy failed to occupy Okhtyrka, which nonetheless sustained significant damage, with many lives lost due to the shelling.\n\n[\\\\\"Okhtyrka\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ar4zxmx7b4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b26ec7c3eea41ff26f0562976a73acda7b91b9)\n\nThe Okhtyrka’s location, roughly fifty kilometres from the Russian border, certainly makes an impact on the pace of its restoration. Yet, local self-government and concerned residents readily share what has already been accomplished so far and what plans lie ahead.\n\n**How the City Authorities Envision the Restoration**\n\nPavlo Kuzmenko, the mayor of Okhtyrka, is trained as a doctor. Before taking office, he served as the head of the traumatological department at the district hospital. Despite the potential risks, he and his team remained in the city during the full-scale invasion, even though it posed a severe threat to him as a local government representative if Russian troops had occupied Okhtyrka.\n\n“When I saw on the cameras that enemy vehicles were driving over our flowerbeds, everything became clear. As a local government body and as patriots of our country, we realised there were two options: either defend ourselves or be killed,” the city head recalls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0796fb57b4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=805e97806c94cf13fb0d4a07939155739095aad3\n\nPavlo stresses that despite suffering significant destruction, Okhtyrka was not occupied. Locals witnessed the resistance of the Ukrainian military as the enemy attempted to raze the city to the ground.\n\n&gt;“Our city was devastated, ravaged as an act of revenge for not letting the enemy through,” he says.\n\nThe first shelling started on 25 February, 2022: The Russian forces used cluster munitions against a kindergarten where many civilians were taking shelter. The next day, the shelling intensified.\n\n&gt;“Three thermobaric bombs were dropped on our city. The city shook, and it seemed like there was no corner where anyone felt safe.”\n\nThe large number of wounded and the urgent need for medical assistance prompted Pavlo to take on surgical duties in those early days of the invasion.\n\n&gt;“Having worked as a doctor for 20 years, I have saved human lives and health that were lost due to plane crashes, household injuries, and other incidents, but here they came to kill us.”\n\nOn 3 March, occupiers destroyed the Okhtyrka Thermal Power Plant, leaving the city without heating and electricity. Pavlo views this as an attempt to force submission. Despite the ongoing fighting near the city, everyone willing to evacuate had the opportunity to do so. Pavlo notes that the city authorities deliberately abstained from setting up a green corridor as it would have exposed the evacuation routes to the enemy, who could then target the buses carrying civilians.\n\nLocal government representatives volunteered to split the duties, such as managing evacuation, supporting the elderly, and providing food for the military, which allowed them to navigate this challenging situation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzi3bbg6b4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8b04dd3f555da5634aea405eb920ff91d1c4ca5\n\nAccording to local authorities estimates, up to 26,000 people left the city by the end of March 2022. However, as of 2024, most of them have returned. Pavlo also stresses that the counts are conducted using unconventional methods.\n\n&gt;“Since all children were studying online, you can’t know if they were in your community or not. However, when charitable organisations provided various treats, we distributed them personally. For example, a charitable foundation brought two trucks of candies. We handed them out to children and counted that we had more than 6,000 children. Out of 7,200 \\[registered\\] children, more than 6,000 are back in the city — that’s great. It means their parents have also returned, and their grandparents are here.”\n\nPavlo points out that he sees nothing wrong with people choosing not to return until the end of the all-out war. The danger has not passed, with ongoing shelling and the threat of another attempt to occupy the city.\n\nAfter the defence forces drove the enemy out of Okhtyrka, Pavlo, during a meeting with the head of the military administration dedicated to reconstruction, called for focusing solely on critical infrastructure and civilian housing. Illustrating his point, he used a metaphor comparing the country to a large organism and cities to its organs and prioritised creating conditions for them to simply function — no more, no less.\n\n&gt;“We are not spreading our efforts thin on rebuilding things we can live without today. Our task is to form thick granulation tissue, to separate ourselves from that overpowering infection, from the enemy, and only then to rebuild the entire organism.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr1tpxtbb4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79a8b63db5717544deb8307a3b7cde56cc2b7e8b\n\nPavlo believes that the state authorities should be more invested in rebuilding thermal power stations; instead, they limited their role to providing financial aid.\n\n&gt;“For some reason, everyone thought that reconstruction meant simply providing funds; they voted, allocated 80 million \\[hryvnias\\] (roughly $2 million – ed.), and \\[expected\\] us to build.”\n\nPavlo believes that recovery efforts during wartime need to be more centralised, as they involve complex projects requiring thorough research, specialised expertise, and proper documentation.\n\n&gt;“Dear friends, try playing democracy when, God forbid, one of your relatives or loved ones needs urgent surgery. You can vote on what kind of anaesthesia to use. First, gather those who need to vote — these will be parents, relatives, siblings, and children; then decide who will perform the surgery, and then everything else, and your loved one will quickly die. Someone needs to take responsibility at this time.”\n\nPavlo agrees that the city authorities should be proactive in the reconstruction efforts, but emphasises that some processes need to be adapted to the realities of war. For example, he believes that allowing the executive committee to make reconstruction decisions instead of the city council would expedite the efforts. The local budget allocated funds for restoring the damaged apartment building, along with one of the five boilers of the power plant. It turned out that this was sufficient for now.\n\n&gt;“To start rebuilding a facility like the thermal power station, we needed to develop a heating scheme for the city. Since the station was built, some organisations that used its heat no longer exist, so restoring the Okhtyrka Thermal Power Plant to its full capacity was no longer necessary.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wzqdt2hb4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47642295f1449a93b6ce72761b15f2d4e1a9425d\n\nIn 2022, Okhtyrka’s local self-government created an electronic platform called EPKO (Electronic Platform for Communication – ed.) to manage donor assistance according to the requests of Okhtyrka residents. Its concept resembles the government initiative DREAM, which we featured in the piece on the restoration of Irpin. However, while DREAM involves community registration, EPKO functions as a register of individuals whose homes were destroyed or damaged due to the full-scale war, helping them to restore their accommodation through the mediation of the city authorities, funds, charitable organisations, and benefactors. Pavlo summarises that the overall restoration of Okhtyrka is funded through several sources: state funds for critical infrastructure, the local budget, and assistance from charities.\n\nMany Okhtyrka residents participated in the eVidnovlennia state program. However, Pavlo points out that the local authorities immediately faced a shortage of personnel to inspect homes and assess the damage, which is essential to qualify for aid. Likewise, they had to adapt to frequent changes in the program as developers gradually updated it based on user feedback. Additionally, there were instances of misuse, in which recipients spent funds inappropriately or resold building materials. Nevertheless, the state puts efforts into enhancing accounting, reporting, and transparency to prevent such incidents from repeating.\n\nPavlo is pleased that Okhtyrka has many active young people who plan to stay in the city and have initiated the Okhtyrka: Urban-Vision project dedicated to the city’s future development.\n\n&gt;“These young people have travelled abroad and compared \\[Okhtyrka\\] to other European cities and Ukrainian cities. They have seen many \\[things that are\\] better than what we have. But they have also seen that our city is quite beautiful as well.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xafwpazlb4hd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2d000058eead7eb81046a7cc7fb928f78e4d791\n\nPavlo believes that the city’s future should be envisioned within the context of a united territorial community, which consists of Okhtyrka and the nearby settlements near the border with Russia. He believes that this approach will positively impact the reconstruction efforts.\n\n# “There should be one large Okhtyrka community extending to the border, a fortified community that can quickly make decisions and build whatever is needed, restore, and develop everything anew.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 896th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

At the onset of the full-scale war, residents from neighbouring houses took refuge in the kindergarten basement. On 6 March 2022, the Russian army shelled the facility, causing a fire that destroyed the roof and part of the building, along with furniture and equipment. The damage inflicted by this and subsequent shelling and rainfall was so extensive that mere repair was unsustainable, requiring extensive restoration. In August 2022, the Lithuanian government undertook the project. The renovated facility opened its doors on 24 August 2023.\n\n**As a gesture of gratitude to Lithuanians, the kindergarten was renamed Ruta, a plant symbolic of Lithuania and with its name resonating in both Lithuanian and Ukrainian languages.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvvpbvqg5zfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6a72261cb3c43209ae6d67357eb970ca0125cf\n\nBefore reconstruction, the facility was named “Joy” and stood as one of the largest in the city, accommodating approximately 400 children in 12 groups, including four specialised groups for children with autism, Down syndrome, and mental disorders. The kindergarten employed about 70 staff members. Originally a two-story building, it has expanded to three floors after the renovation. This includes adding more classrooms, specifically for hosting classes with a speech pathologist, defectologist, a psychologist, and teacher self-training. The canteen and laundry room were redesigned, and most importantly, the basement was expanded and modified as a shelter, equipped with six exits, heating, ventilation, and toilets. It now also features rugs for games and furniture.\n\n&gt;“Apart from the low ceiling, everything is arranged the same as in the group rooms,” says Kseniia.\n\nIf the air raid alarm goes off during lunch, the children can eat in a shelter. The shelter also has three bedrooms available.\n\n&gt;“In agreement with their parents, two- and three-year-olds sleep in the shelter. They have lunch, go downstairs in an organised manner, and if they want to, change into their pyjamas. And the kids spend their nap time in the shelter. It’s very convenient, dark and quiet. The air quality is good, and the temperature is suitable for sleeping. They’re used to it, so they don’t feel stressed. Most importantly, you don’t need to pick up this sleepy baby while an alarm is on and carry them downstairs in your arms. So we are very grateful to have this opportunity.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5aad851i5zfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb47273efc7381a8c9f2d031bf1cdbf4596579f8\n\nAfter reopening in October 2023, “Ruta” recruited eight out of thirteen groups. Kseniia says that many children who attended the kindergarten before the destruction returned.\n\n&gt;“Of course, they are aware of their kindergarten’s history, but children have a different way of coping. They live their preschool childhood as they should: with joy, new emotions, and friends they have had since the pre-war period (before the full-scale war—ed.). They brought all their best and ignited the spark of renewal in this kindergarten.”\n\nAs of early spring 2024, the kindergarten accommodates 230 children across ten groups. An online queue is operating, gradually filling up the remaining groups.\n\n&gt;“Educators call \\[the children’s parents\\]: ‘Hello, we invite you to kindergarten.’ This joy is indescribable. They (parents – ed.) are waiting, which means great demand exists. We still have many children \\[on the waiting list\\].”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5qswqasj5zfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=977ebcce67694e40c05d32ced734fdddce4eb992\n\nKseniia’s husband has been serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces since the first days of the full-scale invasion, although he had previously had a successful marketing career.\n\n&gt;“In our family, we live by the call of our hearts,” she says.\n\nKseniia took over as head of the kindergarten in May 2023 when the restoration process was underway.\n\n# She understands the immense effort required for rebuilding, appreciates Lithuania’s help, and emphasises that real recovery happens only after people return.\n\n# “The fact that our partners from other countries provide opportunities is great. But we, Ukrainians, must do everything ourselves.”\n\n# _______________________________\n\nThe 889th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

She recalls that at the onset of the full-scale war, following the initial de-occupations and counter-offensives, the term “rapid recovery” was actively circulating. The idea was that as long as attacks continued, authorities would focus on repairing, and once the occupiers were driven out, they would switch to rebuilding. However, when partners asked about a recovery strategy, the ministry lacked objective data on the scale of destruction, failing to provide the foundation for its development. This realisation led to the understanding that data had to be continually collected and updated as new destruction occurred.\n\n&gt;“If a strategy does not have proper data, it is anything but a competent strategy,” she says.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnbnzvms2cfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=decce6da234cb2c726468b235915c8011ff66ffb\n\nIn 2023, Oleksandra travelled to Japan, a country that has developed advanced recovery mechanisms due to its location, making it vulnerable to tsunamis and earthquakes.\n\n&gt;“They even have a special form of contract: before the destruction even occurs, they have already selected approximate contracts that have to start work immediately so no time is wasted because they still need to rebuild. They revealed to us that recovery priorities \\[include ensuring\\] the psychological stability of the population and creating workplaces. The psychological stability of the population is linked to whether a person has a job. After that comes social infrastructure and the rest; this was also a significant rethinking for us.”\n\nThe Japanese approach highlights that recovery is a complex process in which enhancing the economy is as crucial for cities as rebuilding their walls. If jobs are available, people return, pay taxes, and enable communities to have sustainable budgets.\n\nThe DREAM system was invented in the spring of 2022 following the first de-occupation of settlements during the full-scale war. It became clear that many projects needed to be controlled, deadlines, and quality monitored so that all procurements were transparent, fostering trust in Ukraine among its partners.\n\n&gt;“The superpower of this system stems from the fact that it was born by the equal efforts of the state, the public, and international partners,” claims Oleksandra.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z8xrktdu2cfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ad9fa75bec48a0afea78953d069053e7c61bb62\n\nIt was implemented based on previous experience, including project management from the governmental Big Construction programme (E-Road online platform) and developing the ProZorro\\* procurement system. It also utilised existing registers and ecosystems like Diia\\*\\*, the Unified State Electronic System in Construction, the Register of Damaged and Destroyed Property, and the Unified Web Portal for the Use of Public Funds Spending.\n\n&gt;**\\*PROZORRO: Ukrainian public electronic procurement platform that was implemented in 2016 to ensure open access to public procurement (tenders), minimising corruption risks .**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\\*DIIA: Ukrainian e-governance ecosystem allowing citizens to utilise 14 types of digital documents (such as ID cards, foreign passports, and driver's licenses) instead of physical ones and access over 120 governmental services online. Since its introduction in 2020, this service is currently used by more than 20 million Ukrainian citizens.**\n\n“DREAM” is an acronym for Digital Restoration Ecosystem for Accountable Management.\n\n&gt;“This system is the only chance \\[for\\] us as citizens of Ukraine, \\[for\\] our partners, to get full transparency and accountability in the reconstruction process. If our team hadn’t developed this system, someone in Ukraine would have come up with it anyway. As a state, we have already come a long way with Prozorro and Diia. And we already have digitalisation in our state-building code.”\n\nTo implement the system, its creators established a project office, which operates with the support of British and German partners. The Ministry provides a legal framework for operation, ensuring not only the technical implementation of this system but also its overall efficiency.\n\n&gt;“Not only I but also other deputies and the Deputy Prime Minister himself oversee this within the Ministry. For \\[the system\\] to work properly from a digital standpoint, it requires a proper legislative basis and proper procedures to ensure that it is not just for display, but really aligned with our reality.”\n\nDREAM was publicly presented in June 2023 at a conference in London dedicated to the reconstruction of Ukraine. In 2024, the team is preparing for a similar conference in Berlin, where they will talk about the updates that have been implemented over the year (the conference was held in June of 2024 – ed.).\n\nOne example of restoration is the Ruta kindergarten in Irpin, which we will detail below. The DREAM website features comprehensive context and all project-related information, including its budget details (procurement, operating costs, sources of income), reconstruction stages, photos, and more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9x5q96o33cfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e11648803df9e8d83f09e48e96eb1e634c38a0f8\n\nCurrently, the main users of DREAM are the communities affected by the shelling and donors interested in investing in the reconstruction. However, Oleksandra’s team plans to expand this circle over time, engaging NGOs and businesses. She notes that the restoration agency is a major client in this process, as it focuses on flagship state projects that specific communities cannot be implemented relying on their own resources.\n\nPresently, the use of DREAM for hromadas\\* is optional rather than obligatory, but Oleksandra claims that the team is working on ensuring that in the future all major investments in hromadas go through the system, securing transparency of the process.\n\n&gt;“When I, \\[ nominally as\\] a community leader, create a project, I begin by defining the task. For example if my school was bombed, the system itself asks, “Are you sure you need to rebuild this particular school in its original format? Or maybe you can buy buses and provide transportation for the children to the neighbouring village? Or perhaps build a new modular one with less space but a good shelter?” In other words, the system enables us to develop a better solution right from the start,” she explains.\n\nOleksandra emphasises that DREAM does not seek to centralise recovery, but rather support the ongoing process. Consolidating everything in one system prevents situations like the one in Borodianka, when six donors were simultaneously ready to restore one kindergarten, having to put in extra time to sort out this issue.\n\n&gt;“I think we are all fortunate that Ukraine’s recovery is a highly decentralised process. On the one hand, we have a lot of real beneficiaries and recipients: communities, schools, utilities, partners, and donors. These can \\[include\\] a development agency, a private investor, or an international financial organisation from one state. And all these organisations interact and have \\[their own\\] priorities.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0b4f0yl83cfd1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d64548acb14da2468854321c7b5faf0908c1fb7\n\nThe prioritisation tool works as follows: if a donor is interested in, for example, inclusive spaces for veterans, green technologies, or education within the context of recovery, the DREAM system assists him with selecting suitable projects. Likewise, the system affects communities, encouraging their responsible attitude to recovery and working transparently to attract more sponsors in the future. Additionally, municipalities can upload their development strategy to the system, ensuring that reconstruction occurs systematically rather than pointwise.\n\nThe ministry prioritises cybersecurity, avoids publishing sensitive information about strategic facility destruction, and uses cloud storage, among other measures. Oleksandra says that when Russian hackers attacked the ministry’s website, her team laughed at this episode, proving that Russians don’t grasp a notion of a truly decentralised system. The ministry site mainly serves as an information service rather than a source of information that could be potentially valuable to the enemy.\n\n&gt;“We say that it is similar to how the Russians bomb’ decision-making centres’. However, in our country, every citizen is at the centre of decision-making.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**\\*DECISION-MAKING CENTRES: During Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure – schools, markets, residential buildings, post offices, etc. – its propaganda media often present it as an achievement, claiming a successful attack on the enemy decision-making centres.**\n\nAccording to Oleksandra, the team is trying to make the system user-friendly for everyone, including donors, who can create their own page in the system where their projects will be integrated.\n\n&gt;“The biggest challenge is for our partners to demonstrate the same transparency and accountability that Ukraine has shown. Not everyone is ready for this. For them, in many ways, it’s like, ‘So, now we have to reform ourselves?’ And Lithuania is leading the way in this regard.”\n\nIn addition, DREAM serves as an informational source for investigative journalists and activists monitoring the recovery process. Oleksandra jokingly says that if there is corruption, it will be noticed online – highlighting that system transparency functions as a kind of safeguard. Ukraine’s international partners also realise this.\n\n&gt;“The four largest international financial institutions – the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Council of Europe Development Bank – have signed a memorandum in which they said, ‘We are using DREAM as the ground for managing reconstruction investments in Ukraine.’ It means that faith and trust in the system are already very high,” she says.\n\nOleksandra views DREAM as a promising development not only for Ukraine but for other countries as well.\n\n# “I want my parents to be able to access the system while walking in the Bucha community and see unfinished construction sites.

And although he chose a very different path than his dad, his love for trains and dynamic machinery was woven into his work.\n\nThe family moved to Kyiv; his father dreamt that Geo would get a solid education there to become a doctor or a diplomat, and Geo did give his shot to both by studying these subjects. He even worked a bit at a train station... But soon, very soon, he knew it was not what he wanted to do. He wanted to write and he wanted to be part of the changes that were sweeping Europe at that time.\n\nAt the young age of 17, he joined a prominent literary club called *Hrono* and immediately dazzled his colleagues with his free-spirited and unconventional ideas. He believed in the new order of things where humans of all nations could live and work together towards the common good.\n\nHe was just 19 when he published his first collection of poems with the cover reading: \"King of the Futurist Prairies Geo Shkurupii.\"  What can we say - the Futurists, no matter what country they were in, were not really a modest bunch. :)\n\nAt 22, Geo published his first two prose collections that shook the Ukrainian literary scene with his Avant-Garde and uncompromising convictions. \n\n[Dada-inspired poem from \\\\\"Avtoportret\\\\\".](https://preview.redd.it/l2wxvcc89yed1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b687b357e8be275fdb749d62be23624cf7999def)\n\nAs befitting a king, he proclaimed various decrees - like introducing the neologism of Panfuturism and calling out Futurism to be a wider global phenomena rather than a limited and national event like in Italy or russia.  He also proposed to switch to the Latin alphabet. He participated in many literary debates, declaring new artistic principles in literature and relentlessly criticizing Ukrainian neoclassicists for their adherence to classical traditions.  Some of his writing seems to have been dedicated to attacking literary critics, which during this decade was quite the global phenomenon.\n\nGeo Shkurupii created in Ukrainian literature a new genre - the experimental novel.  His novel *The Door to the Day*, published in 1929, remains a prime example of this genre. The experiment involved mixing genres and even types of art (one chapter was written in the form of a screenplay, another part of the text is a joint report by Shkurupii and Dmytro Buzko), playing with techniques, intertwining two plot lines where the second line turns out to be just the plot of a painting hanging on the wall in the first line.\n\n[\\(Left\\) \\\\\"Meeting at Crossroad Station,\\\\\" an anthology with other writers \\(Middle\\) \\\\\"Headquarters of Death\\\\\", 1926 \\(Right\\) \\\\\"Terrible Moment\\\\\", considered the first Ukrainian horror novel](https://preview.redd.it/p90szz20hyed1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec0f085d2de0dbb7df019089efb1236ebc5b7ed)\n\nHe simultaneously worked as an editor and screenwriter at a film studio. Cinema was inevitable in Shkurupii's work as it perfectly matched the main dogmas of futurism — dynamism and speed. Now you can see the train connection, right?!\n\nWithin a year, two films for which he wrote the scripts were released one after the other: \"The Blue Package'' (1926, directed by Faust Lopatynskyi) and \"Spartacus\" (1927, directed by Ertugrul Mukhsin-bey, assistant director Hlib Zatvornytskyi).  Both films were shot at the Odesa film studio.  Sadly none survived to our day.\n\n[Cover and dust jacket for \\\\\"The Adventures of Conductor Horne\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/ua0xe9o9hyed1.png?width=2800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25910d3acdfa030528e8cbe887907e41095de065)\n\nAccording to Geo though, Taras Shevchenko was the real first futurist. He sought to “rehabilitate” him in a series of essays for “contemporaries and eternity”, as the Ukrainian luminary’s work at that time was severely limited and downplayed by russian authorities.\n\nHe also stewarded the community of pan futurists in Ukraine.  Geo had many more plans. \n\nHowever, working became increasingly difficult.  His dreams of a world of free individuals were shattered by realities: the Holodomor, the suicides of prominent Ukrainian leaders when they saw what russian communism meant, and arrests in the literary community.  Many of his contemporaries were hauled away to russia and murdered, never to be heard from again.\n\n**On December 3rd, 1934, they came for Geo Shkurupii as well.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Destroyed; Erased\n\n[Shkurupii in the early 1930s.](https://preview.redd.it/dd57ogdn3yed1.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68d97acdd26303eff51f539d9dad5df4fcad16f4)\n\nGeo was accused of being a terrorist and a threat to bolshevik rule.  Two military tribunal sessions were held during which Shkurupii vehemently denied the charges and even submitted a written complaint about the unlawful investigative methods.  However, neither law nor truth mattered - he was sentenced to \"10 years of imprisonment in corrective labor camps with confiscation of property.\"  Shkurupii's wife, Varvara, and their son, Heorhii, were expelled from Kyiv as the family of an \"enemy of the people\" and all their property was confiscated.\n\nTetiana Sheptytska, Deputy Director for Research at the National Cultural Preserve \"Bykivnia Graves,\" emphasizes: \"Futurists were labeled as terrorists, although no evidence or facts have been found in the cases of the repressed to support these accusations, which demonstrates the cynicism and lawlessness of the totalitarian regime.\n\nFuturism was not overtly anti-Soviet or hostile to the reality they observed.  On the contrary, its representatives were often fascinated by industrialization, factories, plants, and industrial growth.  But the soviet authorities wanted to use Ukrainian artists for their own legitimization, to finally take control of Ukraine and convince the Western world that Ukraine was safe and peacefully existing within the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, even 10 years in the camps seemed too little a punishment for the Soviet regime.  \n\nThree years later, on November 25th, 1937, a special troika—the session of the Leningrad NKVD—sentenced a large group of inmates to execution: 509 people, including Shkurupii. \n\n**The sentence was carried out on December 8th, 1937, in the st. petersburg region of russia.** \n\n**He was 34.  His burial place remains unknown to this day.**\n\n**Geo remains largely forgotten and is not mentioned in most articles about the international Futurist movement.**\n\n[Geo's signature.](https://preview.redd.it/gkfb1usbpyed1.png?width=1709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f92147c8e46afc05e8ccfc976763f92de6fe1639)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 885th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

You can find part one** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1e9yg6l/514_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_880th/), and read about how Ruslana was injured by russian aggression.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Ruslana Danilkina](https://preview.redd.it/rku5eqcefced1.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85b4b87ccee92b90dc09e362678c8707f283e8ad)\n\n**Ruslana Danilkina is a veteran who, after her injury and prosthetics, is involved in the rehabilitation of soldiers, helping them adapt to wearing prostheses; she shows by her own example that an active and fulfilling life continues after injury. Since September 2023, she has been part of the Superhumans team - a center for prosthetics, reconstructive surgery and the rehabilitation of war victims.**\n\n**The story of Ruslana, callsign “Sima”, is part of our multimedia project about military personnel who adapt to civilian life after service. We asked the veteran to share about her time in the Armed Forces, injuries, recovery and life without barriers.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Restoration\n\nNow the veteran feels that she is comfortable talking about her injuries, because that way she can inspire and teach others. Ruslana believes that this is her mission, because this is how the soldiers see it: life goes on. Although, earlier, she herself thought that it would be very difficult to experience the loss of a leg:\n\n&gt;\\- Every person thinks that it is better for them to be killed than to remain disabled. Ask every serviceman or servicewoman who voluntarily went there (to the front. — Ed.). Each person is more ready to not return at all than to return with a disability. And I went there with the same feeling.\n\nAlthough the injury changed her life, Ruslana does not regret her decision to join the army:\n\n&gt;\\- I cried a lot of tears when I lost my leg. I cried non-stop. It was very difficult for me and I didn't want to live, I didn't want to accept that my life would be like this now. And I just \\[said\\]: ‘Leave me alone, don't touch me, that's all. I don't want to eat or sleep.’ But I never once cried because of ‘Why did I go there (to the ZSU. — Ed.)?’ Never.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vs9lmdsgfced1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b587b0d1964adc6e920b2acadb35584da9c2bed5\n\nRuslana says that the war and service in the army forced her to reevaluate life's values. It is about everyday moments, such as the opportunity to take a walk and drink coffee, and about larger-scale changes in worldview:\n\n&gt;— When you get injured, lose some part of your body, you realize how nice it was even just to walk. When you put on a prosthesis and start doing things that you couldn't do just a week ago, you rethink everything again.\n\nDuring rehabilitation, according to Ruslana, in addition to physical pain and a phantom sensation in the leg, psychological difficulties also arise. A person with an amputated limb must become aware of their new body and accept it. Ruslana's brother helped her with this. He brought a mirror to the ward so that his sister could look into it and get used to her new appearance, he also took her for walks and to a cafe for lunch every day, and offered to buy new civilian clothes: \n\n&gt;\\- It was very difficult for me to go out in ordinary clothes for the first time. Because I understood that now I will wear normal clothes and look like just a girl without a leg. And when you're standing in your regular ZSU uniform, you look like a warrior who lost a leg because of an important mission. And this, perhaps, does not change anything, but in the head of a person who has been injured, it plays a big role.\n\nIn the hospital in Odesa, Ruslana was constantly aware of the painful realization that life would not be the same as before. Working with a psychologist helped during rehabilitation. The veteran is grateful for the fact that now she knows how not to focus on the past, but to return to the present: to think about how her day was, what she managed to accomplish. She also tries to focus on the good people around her - although there are enough haters, especially on social media. However, Ruslana is sure that only she decides how she should live:\n\n&gt;— I was very dependent on the opinion of other people. Even down to what I should wear, how I will be looked at if I start doing this or that now, if someone will judge me. \\[...\\] I thought, ‘Maybe I don't care about these things at all. Maybe just get off the hook and do what I want, what I like.’\n\nSo Ruslana decided to post on social media to share her rehabilitation progress. The posts received a very positive response, which she did not expect. She mentions that sometimes messages from subscribers helped her to cope with the pain better than painkillers. \n\nAnd over time, Ruslana managed to realize herself in a new state:\n\n&gt;— Only after my injury did I begin to truly love myself. Before the injury, I didn't like my body, my life, or the way I was. It was only on duty that I began to be filled with such pleasant direct impressions. And when I lost my leg, I jumped to the mirror, looked at myself and understood that this is who I am. And maybe the way I am now is the way I was supposed to be. \n\nRuslana is convinced that no one can force an injured person to do something except themselves. Rehabilitation specialists can teach the basics and explain how to use the prosthesis, but how a person will adapt depends only on them:\n\n&gt;\\- You have to understand what you want for yourself. I either see myself as a victim or I'm only beginning to live \\[in a new way\\]. I can either shut myself inside of walls, or I can follow my dreams. Every person who is just starting their journey must understand for themselves who they are in this world. And what they want for themselves. If a person wants to live in a meaningful way, they will live.\n\n# Work at Superhumans\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmatdpxpfced1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa32886b3e5f7fa3560c96176285a0800b3698f1\n\nRuslana was operated on five times. After the Odesa hospital, she was in a sanatorium. And then Olha Rudnieva, the head of Superhumans, invited her to the opening of their rehabilitation center:\n\n&gt;— \\[Olha\\] says: \"You don't have to get prosthetics at our place now. We'll just give you a tour, show you what and how.\" I arrived and immediately knew that I should be here. I really didn't want to go abroad. I really wanted to get prosthetics at home.\n\nSuperhumans is an all-Ukrainian center for prosthetics, reconstructive surgery, rehabilitation and psychological support for adults and children affected by the war. The first facility was opened in 2023 near Lviv. Prosthetics are made there, patients are rehabilitated and prosthetics are provided free of charge.\n\nAfter visiting the center, Ruslana decided to get prosthetics at Superhumans. In just three days, she got a prosthesis. Then the veteran had a clear plan of how she wanted to recover, so she set herself up for it and found success:\n\n&gt;— I started walking immediately \\[after prosthetics\\]. My steps were not perfect, but I kept moving. They told me that it would take me half a year to understand how to walk and move around, but on the fifth day I had already gone to Odesa and confidently walked with one crutch, even with a perfect gait, with perfect balance, leaning on the prosthesis. And with confidence.\n\nThat said, the process was not easy. It happened that the prosthesis rubbed to the point of bleeding, but the veteran still put it on and tried to get used to it, to adapt as best as possible:\n\n&gt;\\- I've been going for a year and I'm still learning. I pass all the obstacles, I know how to run, go up and down stairs. I can do everything. But I won't stop there. Because I want to bring it all to a perfect state. So that it is not at all noticeable that I am wearing a prosthesis. Not because I want to hide, but because I know I can make it so that it won't even be noticeable that I'm wearing a prosthesis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1yzlf5ufced1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9653f5afb302ada330ba8b61bead221f52583192\n\nThanks to her quick rehabilitation, Ruslana began to help other Superhumans patients: she gave advice and shared her experiences. One of the center's rehabilitators offered her to join their team and now Ruslana works in the area of recreational rehabilitation, consulting with the injured, showing them how to work with a prosthesis and adapt: \n\n&gt;— I want to immediately give a person an understanding of what awaits them. I am the kind of person who does not put rose-colored glasses on a patient. I say that it will hurt, it will be difficult, you will get very tired. At times you will be angry with the prosthesis and will not want to wear it because it will be difficult for you. But you should do it as often as possible, as much as possible. Then it will become easier.\n\nRuslana misses the army, her brothers and sisters in arms, but feels that she is now in the right place. After all, by helping other soldiers and civilians recover from injuries she can bring more benefit. This sense of purpose helps Ruslana not to give up:\n\n&gt;— To be part of Superhumans is to be part of superlife, supermotivation. It's intense and very cool!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xj8v1zwfced1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02853408c61a1f3780ebe25d93c3557a8d002518\n\nRecreational Rehabilitation at Superhumans helps patients recover through activities that interest them. The center often asks patients what they wanted to try before the injury.  Ruslana goes rock climbing and golf together with the wounded.  She says that at first she and her team brought patients without prostheses to the training grounds so that they can understand how difficult it is to move, and the next time these people come prepared with their prostheses:\n\n&gt;— I show how to work with a prosthesis, and a person gets a feeling when you can lean on the prosthesis, when you can step on your leg, lift yourself up with your leg and pull yourself out, then attach the prosthesis again, lean on it. After that, you start to get the feeling that it's not just iron - it's something that helps you function in life, it's something you can count on, something that supports you.\n\nAt the center, one of the methods is called \"peer to peer\" - when veterans with amputated limbs show by their own example how to live with a prosthesis and adapt to it. Ruslana explains that it is important for a person to learn to trust the prosthesis, lean on it in the same way as one's own limb:\n\n&gt;— Rehabilitation is not really about teaching how to walk with a prosthesis. Rehabilitation is about teaching how to live with a prosthesis, and teaching a person to understand that they are much more complete than before.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pkehkymzfced1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4c7b4f7f1f57e8a4415f11cbf5f4ee394f5967\n\nThe veteran says that as soon as she comes to work, she immediately smiles when surrounded by patients. Because she understands that they motivate each other to move forward:\n\n&gt;— This motivation, this sense of strength that is felt when sharing a space with them, is something intense and incredible. And I have never felt this anywhere else. Their communication, their banter, their support for each other is incredible. It's very motivating, it's very exciting. And when you lose strength, you look at them and say: ‘Yes, you have to keep going.’ And they look at me the same way.\n\nRuslana says that even military personnel with amputated limbs notice how passers-by sometimes look at them. So if anyone wants to thank them, it is enough to smile and not look away. Ruslana gives an example from her own life when a woman asked if she needed help:\n\n&gt;\\- First, she apologized for distracting me from my work, and secondly, she asked if she could help me with something, and if I needed help. She did not say: ‘Let me help you.’ And she complimented me, saying that I look very beautiful. It stuck in my memory. We went out \\[of the the store\\], she hugged me, we talked a little. I remembered her, I remembered this moment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2tnio922gced1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b357cadc050fb87efbb8b49088bcab9ceb212fa1\n\nThe veteran believes that people should be grateful to their defenders. But you can't teach it - you can only feel it. Ruslana adds that, in her opinion, inclusiveness begins with people: \n\n# - People just have to remain people. Because we can make the ramps [for wheelchairs - Ed.], but we will not teach people [to behave - Ed.] until they themselves want to learn. Just like a person after amputation will not start living the new life until they decide to.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 882nd day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Residents of an apartment building repair a shell-damaged roof and install windows in their apartments on their own. Lithuanian partners restore some socially important facilities, such as a kindergarten. Ukrainian authorities initiate the construction of a critically important bridge next to a destroyed one. Ukrainian specialists have created a massive digital platform where affected communities and interested donors can find each other and build transparent cooperation.\n\nIrpin is located in the suburbs of Kyiv, so at the beginning of the full-scale armed aggression by the Russian Federation, it was partially occupied and became a gray zone where battles took place. Many residents evacuated on the first day, some passing under a destroyed bridge over the Irpin River, and others stayed in the city - including in the occupied part. They had no electricity, communication, or water and were forced to hide in basements while the occupiers looted their apartments. After the liberation of Irpin on March 28th, 2022, various media and foreign delegations began visiting to see firsthand the aftermath of the \"Russian world\": death and destruction. In the first month of the full-scale invasion, 70% of the infrastructure of Irpin was damaged.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ut83y3basd9d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66646d47a91d527717277173e8f651415827336a\n\nSo far, the reconstruction of Irpin has been piecemeal: residents are taking care of their homes, foreign partners are implementing projects mostly related to social infrastructure, and so on. However, compared to the spring of 2022, there has been significant progress towards a more comprehensive approach to recovery. In a new article from the multimedia project \"City Reconstruction,\" we discuss the State-managed digital fundraising platform for reconstruction — DREAM, the activities of the National Agency for Reconstruction and Development of Infrastructure, particularly the rebuilding and memorialization of the Irpin Bridge. We also cover the kindergarten \"Ruta,\" which the State of Lithuania has undertaken to restore, and the vision of Irpin resident and architect Oleh Hrechukh on how his city should develop further.\n\n# Reconstruction Agency\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the National Agency for the Reconstruction and Development of Infrastructure was established in Ukraine, based on the National Agency for Infrastructure Projects and the National Agency for Auto Roads. It is subordinate to the Ministry for Restoration. The head of the Agency, Mustafa Nayem, explains: the Ministry forms the recovery strategy, and the Agency works on its implementation. The current main tasks of the Agency are numerous, including state roads, bridges; building mechanical protection for energy facilities from debris; water supply in the Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia regions; infrastructure of checkpoints on the western border (a logistics artery for deliveries, such as weapons); reconstruction of civil infrastructure; housing restoration, particularly in Yahidne in the Sivershchyna region, Posad-Pokrovske in the Black Sea region, and Irpin in the Kyiv’s Polisia region.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8hwgse9bsd9d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f031f72187129bae96b3ecd9c0eb04b0457a3f8\n\nMustafa explains the priority of the chosen directions using the example of a road checkpoint: before the full-scale war, ports were operating, airplanes were flying, so the load on roads and railways was significantly lower:\n\n\"Currently, 80% of everything leaving the country travels by road.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0z85uufcsd9d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73611a3b03b2b9e554e66a3c744096c6610db94b\n\nHe says that there are many challenges posed by the full-scale war: the country has never faced such extensive destruction, and large projects like the 140-kilometer aqueduct were not carried out for a long time, possibly not since the USSR era. Reconstruction and housing construction need to be adjusted: the State lacks the appropriate mechanisms because the real estate market was private.\n\n\"Currently, we are organizing the recovery machine, which, after the war, will focus on modernizations, new standards, and so on. One of our goals is to be the most stable partner trusted by all players in the construction sphere. That includes donors, the State, local governments, and most importantly, citizens. Therefore, reputation is important to us.\"\n\nIn February 2024, the Agency presented the first edition of the recovery manual, detailing the sequence of actions and the list of documents needed for the recovery project. Local governments, among others, can use it.\n\nOne of the Agency's messages, both domestically and abroad, is that all of this needs to be done now, during the war. Mustafa emphasizes that they are talking about the infrastructure needed for the country to continue living and defending itself:\n\n# \"For now, we're talking about the survival stage, not recovery. The country needs to survive until the end of this war, to win. Then we will deal with recovery, development, and so on. At this stage, with limited human, financial, and even emotional resources, [we need] to do the maximum so that people can live with the comfort they can have.\"\n\nMustafa believes that nearly all projects funded by the State should involve the public, except perhaps for military or other classified facilities. The agency has various tools for this, including the Council of Integrity, which includes representatives of civil society.\n\n\"Since we work locally, in regions, and the main clients are the residents there, \\[...\\] we always conduct public hearings. There is a clear legal procedure for how it should be done, people vote.\"\n\nThis was the case when discussing the design code for the Yahidne village and deciding whether to combine a school, kindergarten, library, and stadium into one structure in Posad-Pokrovsky. According to Mustafa, officials from different regions sometimes treat this procedure as a formality, but, in his opinion, it is about the legitimacy of decisions and people's trust in the authorities.\n\n\"It seems to me that trust is the main asset that will enable our Agency and the country as a whole to attract more resources and progress faster in the future.\"\n\n# Irpin Bridge\n\nIn the context of modern war, many significant events are associated with footage from reporters. One such event is the blown-up bridge over the Irpin River on February 25th, 2022. It halted the movement of the occupiers towards Kyiv but also prevented people from leaving Bucha, Vorzel, and Hostomel, where fighting was taking place. Photos of the pedestrian evacuation under the rubble of the bridge were shocking. Mustafa Nayem says:\n\n\"Hundreds of people were under the bridge, transport was blown up, and it really was one of the symbols of those days - the beginning of \\[full-scale\\] war, when people were left without the opportunity to leave, but it was the only way to stop the occupiers.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gw01cckrsd9d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ef504501ac67bd682b8852df5f8ea52e964dcc8\n\nAfter Ukrainian defenders pushed occupiers out from under Kyiv, a narrow temporary embankment bridge was quickly constructed near the destroyed bridge. This temporary structure enabled the movement of transport to carry weapons, medicine, food, and allowed people to return. Simultaneously, a decision was made to build a new bridge resembling the one before it was destroyed near the ruined section. According to Mustafa, action began swiftly, which is unusual for projects funded by the State.\n\n\"Probably, in peacetime, such decisions would take much longer to be made.\"\n\nHe explains the rationale behind restoring the bridge not only for the community's comfort (as the narrow embankment caused constant traffic jams) but also for the importance of transportation arteries, particularly during wartime.\n\n\"It's important to understand that logistics during war is part of military infrastructure, part of what enables us to fight. When we talk about bridges, roads of defense significance, fortifications, and so on, it's not in opposition to war.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mgeq3agsd9d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b7eb1187621fe7ce3e346eedf78948c0074d238\n\nIn addition to its practical role, this construction had a symbolic importance:\n\n\"For us, it's a vivid example that despite the war, we must continue living. People cannot stop their lives because they still have tasks, including the military, who have to keep fighting and somehow survive during this time. Therefore, despite the war, this reconstruction is ongoing.\"\n\nFurthermore, Mustafa's team initiated the creation of a memorial on the basis of the destroyed bridge. Public hearings were held where this idea was approved. They plan to create a park, and there are already sketches that will be realized after the war.\n\n\"The idea is to preserve the bridge exactly as it was after its destruction. This means even the vehicles that were destroyed there will be preserved, and they will remain in that state; nothing will be restored in this ruined section.\"\n\nMustafa adds that he understands for people who pass by it daily, this scene can be painful; however, it's primarily about preserving the memory for future generations of Ukrainians.\n\n# \"I really hope that our children, grandchildren will remember this and remember at what cost freedom comes, and most importantly, they will not allow the return of those same traditions when Ukraine was permeated with Russian influence at all levels. This memorial is meant to be a monument that will prevent this from ever happening again.\"\n\nThe restored bridge was opened in 2023 on the Day of Dignity and Freedom.\n\n\"By the way, it's a symbolic story. On November 21st, we opened traffic on it, which happened to be the day the Revolution of Dignity began. It wasn't planned… it just happened that way.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 856th day of a ten year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

    "selftext": "# Crimean Tatar Coffee Culture\n\n[A cup of coffee in a Crimean Tatar restaurant in Odesa.](https://preview.redd.it/vxr2zhh8v68d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=447e5a37719b06c832b3eacad14922a380551e0e)\n\nI am not sure if there is a more controversial topic out there than coffee culture!  The Italians and French prefer their espresso, and everyday Americans seem to swing wildly between a spartan and mechanical drip coffee to something resembling five desserts forced rather unceremoniously into one cup.  \n\nUkrainians for their part have managed to perfect a rich tapestry of pies, cakes and cookies that  wonderfully frame and support the coffee (in Ukrainian: **Kava**) of your choice.  Coffee culture remains very big in Ukraine - in fact, one of Ukraine's folk heroes is Yurii Kulchitskiy, a Ukrainian born in 1640 who made a mark on coffee culture as a whole (we wrote about him [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/vevk80/446_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_115th_day_of/)).\n\nBut the tradition of Ukrainian coffee, too, did not magically appear without the finesse of many generations of coffee OGs.  The strongest influences here were from Turkish and Crimean Tatar culture who perfected this tasty art long, long before the espresso machine made its debut.\n\nI myself when frequenting Lviv coffee shops back in the day, never saw an espresso or a drip machine. Instead I saw even in the smallest bars and coffee shops a special stove with sand on it where a barmaid or bartender would make each coffee to order.  Nowadays, even though you can order any kind of coffee under the sun, Crimean style coffee is still available to order if you know where to look.\n\nThere's deep tradition here that stretches from the coffeeshops of modern Ukraine to the coffeehouses of Crimea - all the way back to the coffee culture of Turkey and Arab nations.\n\nSo to all you coffee hipsters out there with your pour-overs and oat milk lattes: check it out!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Welcome in a Coffee Cup\n\n[Remarkable painting called \\\\\"Tatar coffee houses at the Bazaar in Bakhchysarai\\\\\" by German painter and ethnographer Wilhelm Kiesewetter \\(1846\\).  Bakhchysarai was the capital of the Crimean Khanate.](https://preview.redd.it/1lnaxbxbj68d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c584d1d6d12b8f142e032da5c56e8598d505ed8a)\n\nIn Crimean Tatar culture, the guest at home was greeted upon arrival with a cup of freshly made coffee.  Even a complete stranger would be treated to this warm (scalding hot?) hospitality and offered refuge from a weary trip.  Crimea has long (really for millennia) been a crossroads of cultures.  Accordingly, it was considered quite good luck and an honor to be able entertain a traveler in this way.\n\n[\\\\\"Tatar Coffeehouse\\\\\" by German painter and ethnographer Wilhelm Kiesewetter \\(1846\\).  You can see the dzezva in the stove.](https://preview.redd.it/v006hr0oj68d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d9fd6086df083524f3d611009ca3cfbb1837bbb)\n\nThe coffee offered to the guest was a ritual offering sustenance, but also would create a cozy warm environment to ponder life and also take a break from it.  And it wasn't just served in the home - there were many coffeehouses throughout Crimea where you could hang out, smoke a bit, and people watch.  These are my kinds of places!\n\n[Model of a Crimean coffeehouse by Wilhelm Kiesewetter \\(1846\\).](https://preview.redd.it/9y9osxfik68d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efda684edfca25265778af1a8a1654cb705a196f)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Always Be Prepared\n\nThe coffee ritual would begin with grinding coffee beans very finely using a special copper coffee grinder, called a **Kave Degirmen**.  Please understand that this kind of coffee must be ground extremely finely - it's like powder!\n\nOnce you've done that, you pour the coffee into a copper little pot called **Dzezva** and add cold water.  It is important not to fill it to the top, as you need to leave a little room so when the coffee gets scared it has a place to hide...  I will explain later.  Some people like to add a few grains of salt, which colloquially would be called “A Man’s Way coffee”. \n\nThe ratio of coffee and sugar differs depending on the strength of the beans and the maker’s mood, but usually it would be about 90 milliliters of water to 1-2 teaspoons of ground coffee.\n\nThen the dzezva (coffee pot) is placed into hot sand (or sometimes over coals or directly in an oven), and nestled there; the coffee is gradually brought to a light boil, indicated by a thick and fragrant foam.  When the foam begins to rise, it is very important to take it off the heat before it boils over the edge! \n\nI read that Crimean Tatars describe this moment in a process as  \"scaring\" the coffee, as the moment you take the dzezva off the heat, the foam retreats back into the Dzezva, like a little kitten who is taking a step back when faced with something they are not sure of. \n\nThis requires the maker's concentration and attention, and I can attest to that.  I have made many dzezva in my life and there were times when I did not scare the coffee in time.  When the foam runs off, it's gone... and the taste is not the same…\n\nBut let’s assume success!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Serving\n\n[Antique Crimean zarf in a museum collection in Ukraine.](https://preview.redd.it/cyt0b2rkm68d1.png?width=1212&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a08528bb710f38900951225f211c0bd4f27553b)\n\nThe coffee is served in small cups, **Fildjan**, that are placed inside a **zarf** \\- a metal stand used so that the drinker won't burn their fingers.  Zarf are sometimes *incredibly* ornate and made from silver, copper or other fine metals.  Crimean metalworking has always been very fine and internationally renowned (even to ancient times)!\n\nFirst, the coffee maker carefully places the coffee foam into each fildjan with a coffee spoon, and then pours the rest of the coffee.\n\nIt is not mandatory to add sugar to the coffee - instead, it is often sipped while nibbling on small pieces of hard sugar or milk sugar; it was also common to munch on small shortbread cookies.\n\n[ Kurabye shortbread cookies](https://preview.redd.it/d1vw1i5as68d1.png?width=1031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a572ea45e93b39afc895c68a0dfae8beb2594a48)\n\n**Milk Sugar Extravaganza**\n\n* Here is a quick recipe of a milk sugar.\n* Take 1 kg of sugar and 180-200 grams of milk.  In a pot place the sugar and then add milk. Cook it on low heat for 40 to 50 minutes.  Allow it to cool.  Take it out and break it gently into pieces.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Tatar Kava Rituals: A Primer\n\n[Photo taken in Crimea in the 1920s by Crimean Tatar ethnographer Usein Bodanynsky.

The preparation is accompanied by conversation and the rhythmic sound of grinding coffee beans in the coffee grinder.  Hosts ensure that the guest covers important topics, pausing on the health of relatives, domestic news, or children's achievements.  During this little ritual, freshly brewed coffee and sweets appear on the table.\n* **Saba kahvesi** (\"morning coffee\") is a coffee with the family.  It provides an opportunity to gather at one table, make plans, shares ideas, and prepares for important tasks - all at the beginning of the day.\n* **Bayram kahvesi** (\"quick coffee\") – The custom of drinking coffee during visits to relatives on major religious holidays like Kurban and Oraz Bayram.  Bayram kahvesi is considered a \"quick coffee\" because up to 30 visits to various relatives need to be made in one day!\n* **Gelin kahvesi** (\"bride's coffee\") – Coffee brewed by a woman after the wedding when she receives guests in her husband's home.  Since the bride's parents do not participate in the visit, it is less formal, allowing a break from the wedding hustle, bringing relatives closer together, and establishing new family relationships.\n* **Kozaidin kahvesi** (\"coffee for joyful news\") – coffee served to close ones to share good news and family successes.  Used to thank each other for support, share joy with loved ones and show solidarity in the community.  I like that there is a specific phrase for this.  Very cozy.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**This year, the coffee tradition of Crimean Tatars was added to the list of intangible cultural heritage of Ukraine by Ukraine Ministry of Culture and Information Policy.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 850th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

It’s taking a large amount of coarsely ground beans and soaking them in water for about 16 or 20 hours - brewer’s choice in terms of time and amount of beans. It’s like French press without heat and lots more time. As a result, the coffee tastes smooth and less acidic. Then add ice, a sweetener of choice, and cream if desired.

The distinction is subtle but important.\n\nSome news outlets mistakenly (purposefully?) reported this event as a gay parade. Many people picture gay parade as a colorful celebration in their heads. However, it is far from reality. There were no celebrations on this sober day in a country ravaged by an ongoing war.\n\nThe Equality March was focused on two goals: (i) a push for legislative support of civil partnerships and anti hate-crime laws and (ii) a fundraising event organized by LGBT+ military personnel.

Salt in those times was not taken for granted as we kind of do today. Today it is one of the cheapest things in a supermarket, but back then it was a big deal, as it was the way people could make food much tastier and preserve it for the long and snowy winters.\n\nThe salt was such a big deal that in the 12th century in the Kyiv-Pechersk Patericon (a type of a book), it was recorded that a quarrel between two local nobles dangerously affected the salt supply from Halych for Peremyshl!  We wrote more about the importance - both economic and political - of the salt trade in our post about Chumaks [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1c8fjme/555_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_787th/).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Worth Its Salt\n\n[Historical Drohobych salt on display in a museum exhibit.](https://preview.redd.it/ksyxp3ef116d1.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=779907a80bc2546ddf1cb1de8b832b565c111e6c)\n\nIn fact, for a long time it seems that the whole town's life centered around making salt and supplying nearby and faraway lands.  Just to load their wagons with Drohobych salt, Chumaks traveled from various parts of Ukraine: Podillia, the distant Bratslav region, Kholmshchyna, Volyn…  At the nearby river ports, Drohobych salt was loaded onto river cargo vessels and transported to the Pripyat, and then down the Dnipro River all the way to Kyiv and beyond.  The unofficial official motto of Drohobych today is \"Drohobych has the salt,\" which in English might be loosely translated as “all you need is in Drohobych.”\n\nThe technology for extracting salt was as follows: special jars (*cherini*) were filled with water enriched with salt, and these large containers were heated over a fire.\n\nStreet names associated with this process have been preserved to this day in Drohobych: Zvarytska Street (from the word for boiling), Zhupna Street (Zhupa means \"Saltworks\"), Solonyi Stavok Street (\"Salty Pond\").  When the water evaporated, only the salt remained, which was fired over the flames in the form of cones.\n\nNine such cones became the symbol of the city and are depicted on the city's coats of arms from various periods of its history, no matter which flag was on top of the Drohobych castle.\n\n[The flag of Drohobych.](https://preview.redd.it/fquxlndq616d1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b2ce5bdec61ff547be44e7eac413fd9fce6365e)\n\nSadly, the castle did not survive to our days, as Drohobych's history, just like most places in Ukraine, was turbulent and tragic.  But what survived to this day is the Drohobych Salt Production Plant, which has been recorded as producing salt continually since 1390, making it one of the oldest enterprises in Europe!\n\n[Drohobych Saltworks today.](https://preview.redd.it/e8kse074v06d1.png?width=1181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b1a80cbdabe1dd180951cd6e3760e8ac3971e00)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# All Roads Lead to Salt (Well, Some Lead to Oil?)\n\nDuring the Kyiv Rus times, Drohobych was a center of the Peremyshl region.  Still, Drohobych had its share in being burned and pillaged in the Middle Ages by Mongols and Tatars; but it managed to rebuild and develop despite these setbacks and in 1422 received Magdeburg Rights and a Town Hall was built.\n\nAccordingly, the salt barrels kept rolling!  For example, in 1565, it was recorded that 26,000 barrels of salt were boiled in Drohobych.\n\nLater, when the city was a part of the Austria-Hungary Empire, Drohobych saw a second production boom - this time it was another very coveted resource - oil! \n\nOil and ozokerite deposits discovered on the outskirts of the city propelled Drohobych into becoming one of the first cities in Europe to use oil lamps for lighting, as early as 1788!  In 1817, Drohobych's military barracks and Salt Plant were the first in Europe to be lit by kerosene.  In 1822, the first oil lamp was installed in front of the Town Hall.  By 1836, city street lighting had begun.\n\n[Drohobych loves its literature.  Requisite Taras Shevchenko statue, left.  Drohobych residents writer Ivan Franko \\(center\\) and scientist Yurii Drohobych \\(right\\).](https://preview.redd.it/mx57fjco016d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=708f0cf3165c696d5be98842d1946e5e2903f07b)\n\nThe production and economy boom was accompanied by a lively multicultural life and strong education system.  Ukrainian literary luminaries such as Ivan Franko (we wrote about this pivotal figure [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/zdvb6m/743_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_286th_day_of/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/zesdtv/743_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_287th_day_of/)), and Vasyl Stefanyk lived and studied in Drohobych, hundreds of years after the great scientist [Yurii Drohobych](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1d7kvxb/449_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_832nd/) did.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Immense Tragedy\n\n[The former Jewish Orphanage in Drohobych.](https://preview.redd.it/hkp7zmzpx06d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9797bb5a496d3aed70e0a2ca2bf5d226614dd5c)\n\nSadly, the glory days of the city and its surroundings did not last, and it suffered significant damage during World War I.  \n\nNotably, in 1915, the Orphanage for Jewish children was raided by russian forces: bullet holes can still be seen in the forged iron entrance doors.  To inflict even more destruction, the retreating russians even took the equipment from the oil refinery and spilled the oil reserves from the storage facilities, poisoning the earth.\n\nSound familiar? \n\nThe brief Ukrainian independent state (we wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uynbm6/456_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_93rd_day_of_the/)) was soon squashed by the russian-Ukrainian war and Ukraine was divided again; this time Drohobych was included in the Polish state. This led to Drohobych and her people being attacked by Nazi Germany as early as September 10th of 1939 and occupied only one week later, similar to other Polish-held lands. \n\nThe madness continued as only about two weeks after that, the Nazis left Drohobych as it was gifted by Nazis to their russian collaborators, according to the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The pillaging began right away (or as russians called it: “nationalization”) and all private property was seized.  A significant portion of Drohobych's oil products between 1940 and 1941 were exported to meet the needs of the Third Reich, courtesy of the russians.\n\nAll of the city's newspapers and other periodicals were discontinued and replaced by communist publications.  All cultural organizations were closed.  Many residents were killed or sent to Gulags.\n\nBut then it somehow got worse. \n\nThe Nazis attacked Drohobych on June 22nd, 1941, as the Germans betrayed their USSR pals.  At the same time, russians were in the process of tightening the screws on the local population by carrying out “cleaning operations” - arresting most Ukrainian and Polish intelligentsia.  Teachers, students, and anyone else who did not seem right to them were deported, and the rest were killed.\n\nThe German occupation continued to bring more unthinkable tragedies.  According to the Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes, 14,500 people were executed in Drohobych, 10,800 prisoners of war were killed, 42 teachers, 47 doctors, and 100 workers and engineers from the ceramic and oil refining plants were murdered.  Additionally, thousands of residents were deported to forced labor in Germany. \n\n**Out of the many thousands of Jewish residents of Drohobych, only 500 managed to survive.**  \n\nThe most famous Drohobych native of Jewish origin, Bruno Schulz (one of the great Polish-language writers of the 20th century) was shot and killed and buried in a mass grave.  The children of the Jewish orphanage were not among the survivors.\n\nMany of those that did survive were hidden and protected by Drohobych residents who have since been honored by the Yad Vashem as \"Righteous Among the Nations.\"\n\n[The Choral Synagogue of Drohobych.](https://preview.redd.it/37o4i6vgw06d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff2c6751121c8fd8e3c87d24ec2fa3206daec3fe)\n\nOne of the largest Choral Synagogues in Ukraine is located in Drohobych.  During Soviet times, the synagogue served as a salt warehouse. Later, the building was used as a furniture store. With Ukraine regaining independence, the synagogue was returned to the local Jewish community. \n\nThe solemn reopening of the synagogue took place on June 17th, 2018, and on July 3rd, 2019, the Torah was ceremonially brought into the synagogue.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Today\n\n[Drohobych has an incredible variety of exquisite architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/1bz5j2hx916d1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=341eb50f9685b19d0b02b0828cc95e6d6d80b47d)\n\nToday, Drohobych is a particularly attractive little city with many things to see and do, and nooks one can visit.  The impressive Tustan Cliff Fortress (we wrote about this one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/113hnbc/708_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_357th_day_of_the/)) is just around the corner, and the city itself boasts a lot of wonderful architectural sights from the heydays of the economic boom.  There are also places much older, like the incredible wooden Church of St. George we wrote about last week [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1d5d0nj/451_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_829th/).\n\n[The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Drohobych \\(1690\\).](https://preview.redd.it/wl1znrc8916d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa2e33075c1b6070b325a5562c8eb6aac0b98752)\n\nBut Drohobych also remembers its tragic past.  One such monument is the Museum on Stryiska Street - a prison that was used by three different occupational governments in the 20th century to carry out the infliction of unimaginable suffering on fellow humans.  During the reign of terror of the NKVD in the first years of soviet occupation, thousands of residents of the Drohobych region were tortured and executed.  Grim reminders of atrocities include torture tools, weapons, and a mass grave where the bodies were dumped.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n[The former prison on Stryiska Street today.](https://preview.redd.it/2ur2t194w06d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38af9f7ec73891ed19c069b0f92098982fb0b9eb)\n\nYes, tragically history on Ukrainian lands repeats itself yet again.  But as my brother, a ZSU soldier, said - this is the last war with russia.  That's because Ukraine will decisively win, once and for all.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 840th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

It has been condensed for Reddit.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/diw56v3kk85d1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eebae73e029e05cf308341e9b1a121ed32b87073\n\n**This is a report about two people who managed to flee the occupied town of Oleshky amidst the chaos following the Russian explosion of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. They got lucky, if one could even call it that. Residents of the flooded left bank of the Dnipro River were trapped — the occupiers were blocking the evacuation, shooting at those who wanted to get out on their own, and, of course, lying that “everything is fine, there is no need to panic.”**\n\nWe met Andrii, 56, and Yulia, 53, in Kherson the day after they arrived in the Ukraine-controlled area from occupied Oleshky. We brought them clean clothes. The couple planned to go to the west of Ukraine to visit their daughter and grandchildren. Andrii and Yulia showed me a video of them eating ice cream in Kherson for the first time in a year and a half. Then, they recalled the horrors they had experienced and started crying.\n\nOleshky is a town on the left bank of the Dnipro River, which has been under occupation since the beginning of the full-scale war. After Russian troops retreated from Kherson in November 2022 and blew up the Antonivskyi Bridge, communication between the town and the right bank of the Dnipro River became impossible. As a result of a large-scale Russian terrorist attack on 6 June, 2023, which blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam, dozens of settlements in the lower Dnipro River area were flooded or completely covered with water.\n\n# Learning about the terrorist attack on the occupied Kakhovka hydroelectric power station\n\n“The dam has been blown up,” a friend told Andrii by phone. It was seven o’clock on a Tuesday morning. It’s about 50 kilometres from Oleshky to the Kakhovka power plant, so the sound of the explosion did not reach the town. The locals learned about the impending big water from friends who called, from Ukrainian television, or the Internet. The occupation administration didn’t inform the locals about the coming flood.\n\nAndrii, without disturbing Yulia, got out of bed and, for the first time since the beginning of the occupation, took three guns from his hiding place. The situation could portend anything. The man felt a weight on his shoulders, contemplating the disaster he and his wife would soon face. But at the same time, hope arose inside him that all this, their life under the occupation of the Russian Federation, would finally come to an end. They had not dared to evacuate their hometown before as they believed they were too old. They did not want to leave their beautiful two-story house with a magnificent garden, and believed that the Ukrainian military was to arrive soon.\n\nAndrii took his boat out to the yard, lowered it from the carriage (a trailer for transportation of cars or special equipment) and put two oars and a tarpaulin inside. He tied one end of the cable to the boat, then threw the rope into his room through an open second-floor window and secured the other end to prevent the boat from being swept away by the water. \n\nHe told Yulia about the blown-up dam. They then began taking out canned food, vegetables, and firewood from the basement, as they had a fireplace on the second floor. To stay updated on the latest news about the flood, they relied on Ukrainian television broadcasts accessed via a satellite dish. They were trying to understand whether their house would be completely flooded.\n\nIn the afternoon, Andrii hopped on his bike and went to investigate the situation. It was important to find a hill to escape to. While passing through Oleshky, he came across an elderly couple standing in the middle of the street. The woman was crying and the man was trying to calm her down. Andrii intervened.\n\n“Son, we’re going to be flooded!” the woman cried out. Their children and relatives were abroad. There was nowhere to run.\n\n“When you hear the water, come here quickly,” Andrii said, gave his address and rode on. He never saw them again.\n\nThen Andrii and Yulia watched the news on the TV again: “…the explosion of the dam and the machine room…”, “…the disaster occurred at around three in the morning…”, “…a particular threat to the lower-lying left bank…”\n\nInformation about the expected flooding level varied.\n\nAround six in the evening, the power went out in Oleshky. So the couple stayed at home for the rest of the day. \n\n# How the water kept coming into Oleshky \n\nAt one o’clock in the morning, Andrii heard the sound of rushing water. He opened the window and could hear dogs barking and people shouting in the distance. He and his wife went outside and saw the road was flooding. On the other side of the water, a woman with a flashlight stood watching the waves wash over the street. The couple decided to return to their house while they could still walk on dry ground — the water was rising too fast.\n\nIt was Wednesday morning, and the water in Andrii and Yulia’s yard was already a metre high. The door to the house was firmly closed, so the water was barely seeping in. Andrii went down to the basement to save a few more cans of preserves and retrieve the pumping station. Just then, the sewer pipe running through the room burst, causing sewage to gush into the basement.\n\nThe two went up to the second floor. Outside, the wind was whistling, and there was a noise coming from below — water and all the contents of the sewer were washing away the first floor. Furniture, the refrigerator, and other appliances were being swept away. Andrii made notches on the wall of the house with a knife to mark the water level. From the first night, the water had been rising by five centimetres every five minutes, but by morning, the rate of flooding had slowed.\n\nThe water was overcoming the fence, and the boat tied to the house was already drifting. Andrii untied the boat and wanted to swim to rescue his neighbours, but he could not get out of his own yard as the gate was locked with two bolts submerged under water, one at the top and one at the bottom. The man returned to the house, took a hoe and, swimming to the gate, opened the bolts with the tip of the tool.\n\nAndrii took his neighbours to his house, where the second floor was still dry. Then he went on a scouting mission. The water continued to rise, and while he could already turn on the motor, he continued to paddle instead: the Russian military was looking for motor boats and would confiscate either the engine or the entire boat. Watercraft without motors was not suitable, due to the swift current in many places, and inflatable boats could be easily punctured.\n\nAlong the flooded streets, there was chaos: cows were mooing, dogs and cats were swimming by, and the current was carrying beehives, firewood, and garbage. Cries of “Help!” were heard everywhere. Andrii was busy transporting people from smaller houses to houses with two or more floors. It was a sunny and hot day, and many people were sitting on their roofs without any shade.\n\nDuring all this time, the shelling continued: Russian artillery on the outskirts of Oleshky was firing on Kherson.\n\nStruggling to maintain his course, Andrii accidentally collided with the side of the boat with the trunk of an apricot tree, causing a swarm of bees to descend upon him. Swiftly, he grabbed a tarpaulin, wrapping himself tightly within it as he sensed the bees attempting to breach his makeshift shield. After a tense moment, the bees relented, allowing Andrii to continue on his journey.There were many more bees flying around from the flooded hives, many of them also became homeless.\n\nIn the morning and afternoon, there were almost no boats on the water.\n\nWhile swimming down the street, Andrii heard a hoarse cry. He looked around. Then he heard a woman’s voice come from an old house. The man saw a grandmother looking out from the attic from the triangular cut-out of the mansard. He began to call her to the boat, and the woman jumped out of the door on the other side of the attic.\n\n“Take me to Lyuba,” she said. Andrii started rowing to the neighbouring house. Lyuba, the friend of the grandmother, was sitting on the roof. However, the house was too high for Andrii to transfer the grandmother there safely. Instead, he suggested placing her on another nearby tall building where the ascent would be easier.\n\n“No need! If I die, then it’ll be in my house,” she said and agreed with Lyuba that some man would come by boat and take her from the attic. So Andrii took his grandmother back, having neither the strength nor the time to argue.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zkgdxvqzk85d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff6a253932b8012f461c3dbdacbd0cfe88da8bca)\n\nMany people asked for transport, but most men refused. Andrii primarily saved women with children or the elderly. Navigating obstacles, persuading people to get into the boat, waiting for them to gather their belongings, and finding a way to safely disembark all took up precious time. Unfortunately, there was no time to discuss rescuing animals, even though many people pleaded to save their cats and dogs.\n\nAndrii swam past the tall rose hedge that lined the road. Two-thirds of the bush was submerged, with rose petals floating on the water. Nearby, on a raft nailed to a wall, a brown dog sat helplessly. Andrii had to keep swimming.\n\nIt was then Andrii saw two boats with Russian soldiers sailing past the drowning people in Oleshka. One approached him.\n\n“Do you have a working engine?” he asked.\n\n“No. As you can see, I’m rowing with oars,” answered Andrii. The invaders swam away.\n\nBy the evening, rescuers among the locals increased. The Russian military, though, did not help the people. One guy made a raft by tying empty plastic bottles to a pallet. The man was rescuing animals, he even managed to pull a hedgehog out of the water. Residents of the city called their relatives, friends and acquaintances directly from the rooftops and begged to be rescued.\n\n## It stopped, damn it!\n\nIn the evening, Andrii sat at home with Yulia and the neighbours again, illuminating the front wall with a flashlight. He was looking at the last mark he had placed a few hours ago, now slightly covered by water. He looked again and at half past one in the morning he shouted:\n\n“It stopped, damn it!”\n\nThe water really stopped rising, and in the morning it fell by 50-60 centimetres.\n\nThere was no thought that dry areas could still remain in Oleshky, because it seemed as if water had flooded the entire city. However, in the morning, Andrii swam in the direction opposite the Dnipro River and discovered that there was still land near the hospital. He began taking people there, starting with the neighbours who had been in his house, and then rescuing others. By Thursday, he had helped evacuate about 12 people.\n\nIn some places, the depth had reached four metres, only the crowns of trees and the roofs of houses protruded above the surface. Andrii swam at the height of power poles, occasionally getting tangled in the wires.\n\nOn Thursday, the street became much quieter.\n\n# “Is there anyone alive?” Andrii shouted, swimming through the blocks. \n\nOnly dogs barked back. Many were still around: some floating, others clinging to bits of land or any objects that had accumulated, forming tiny islands of salvation.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/c0nwjsa5l85d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4163421a620427ac08d1ad937ee06a02a896eb0)\n\nOn Thursday, pallets, concrete mixers, refrigerators, wooden decks, etc. floated with the current. One of the neighbouring houses was torn loose and drifted out to the open sea. The water was swirling violently.\n\nIn the evening, Andrii noticed that the current had carved out a wide corridor leading to the river, about 50 metres wide, opening a path to Kherson. However, due to the one-metre difference in water level, it was dangerous to sail there. Nevertheless, hope was growing inside him. He returned home.\n\nYulia was terribly afraid of water and even before the war hardly ever got into a boat, so she didn’t want to entertain her husband’s suggestion of getting out of Oleshky using the newly emerged path. But Andrii insisted, saying they just needed to cross the riffle (a shallow section of a river), and then rescuers would be waiting beyond.\n\n “It’s like we’re in Venice!” he joked. After looking at the faeces floating among the children’s toys, and then at her flooded luxurious garden, grown with painstaking work, Yulia agreed.  \n\n## Sailing from occupied Oleshky to freedom\n\nThe final decision was made on Friday morning. Andrii launched the backup inflatable boat into the water and tied it behind the motorboat with a sturdy television cable. At this time, there were still two neighbours left in the house. Andrii offered them to join. Two people could fit into the inflatable boat. But they categorically refused — it was too dangerous. They asked to be dropped off near the hospital, and Andrii agreed. \n\nWhen he returned, he and Yulia hastily gathered their belongings, packing their wedding suits, two favourite photo albums, an acupuncture mat, plush bunny, and toy dog ​​that their grandchildren used to play with into the rubber boat. Andrii grabbed the branded box from his phone — in the chaos, it was difficult to rationalise the decision. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/322nuxmhl85d1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1b6f682cd74a891c7ad7a56cd77ea33360ecaff\n\nThey took two bright flashlights.\n\n“If we get carried out into the open sea, we’ll use them as beacons,” joked Andrii. Or maybe he wasn’t joking.\n\nTheir drinking water wasn’t in bottles, but in jars, so Yulia wrapped them in white towels and handed them down to Andrii from the window. The towels could serve as white flags if needed. From their food supplies, they only took a bag of walnuts. They also took three guns with ammunition as a “gift” for a Russian patrol. Yulia sat in the boat wearing a pink t-shirt adorned with plastic pearls and jeggings. Instead of a lifebuoy, they had a car tire. Andrii wore a t-shirt, shorts, and rubber boots. Both of them wore wide-brimmed beach hats on their heads. They set sail around half-past seven in the morning. \n\nOn the roof of one of the buildings they were passing by, a woman shouted:\n\n# “Just don’t forget about us!”\n\nYulia looked at her and silently pointed towards the Dnipro River.\n\n“I understand,” the woman’s expression shifted between understanding and despair.\n\nOvernight, the water level dropped even further, the rapids diminished, and the channel itself widened by 20 metres. However, the current remained strong, pulling the boats into a whirlpool. Andrii grabbed onto an electric wire stretched between two poles and, holding onto it, slowly descended downstream — away from the whirlpool, but towards an acacia tree. This caused the inflatable boat to collide with its thorny top. The items inside were lightweight, so it continued to float, albeit slightly tilted. But Andrii couldn’t help but think that if they had taken two more people with them, the inflatable boat might have sunk.\n\nHaving aligned both vessels, Andrii swam into the forest and moved further between the trees so that Russian patrols or snipers would not see them. Further, behind the submerged islands, a view of Kherson opened up, rising far, far away on the other shore.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/vtai0vxml85d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc9e1e3f5a98db97926d977f7b7293021543c8e8)\n\nNow Yulia realised that no one was waiting for them near the riffle — Andrii reassured her to convince her to get into the boat. Then they had to paddle to the other side on their own. But Yulia no longer cared about that. And the fear of water completely disappeared.\n\nTo make it more difficult for the Russian military to shoot them, they decided to swim diagonally, against the current.\n\nSuddenly the rope snapped, and the second boat began to drift downstream. Yulia grabbed the television cable to hold the boat with the belongings. For the rest of the journey, she kept it afloat.\n\nBetween the banks of the Dnipro, there were islands with summer cottage communities, including two-story houses visible from the water. The couple feared that Russian military personnel might be lurking there, so Andrii nudged the rifle closer. As they approached the first island, the boats began to drift away. While Andrii attempted to hold onto the motorboat, his wife firmly grasped his hand.\n\n“The land is floating!” Both of them watched as the entire island began to drift with the current. Their hair stood on end. Andrii tried to steer away from the whirlpool that swept the entire island away. Meanwhile, the land continued to float along with trees and rocks – straight into the sea.\n\nBut in a minute it turned out that it was not the island floating, but the boats being carried in the opposite direction. Andrii tried to swim against the current, but the current turned out to be so strong that it still carried them downstream.\n\nFrom the direction of Olehky, a drone appeared in the sky. They looked to see if it was armed with a grenade, but they could not see clearly — the “iron bird” hovered against the sun. Andrii steered the boats further towards Kherson, and just before reaching the city, they encountered a swift current that began to carry them away along with the rapids. They had to turn back and anchor near a concrete pillar with a blue and yellow flag. They anchored and waited for rescuers to notice them. Drones continued to fly in the sky. One of them hovered over the two boats.\n\nAndrii untied the ship and began to slowly drift between the trees, hiding in the bushes: if the drone came with a grenade, it would be more difficult to drop it. A snake fell from one tree directly into the boat. Yulia began to scream, while Andrii threw it overboard with a light swing.\n\nFinally, they spotted a military boat heading toward a concrete pillar with a flagpole. There are two soldiers on the ship. Identification marks were not visible from afar. Andrii and Yulia hid behind a bush, so the boat sailed past.\n\nAnother “bird” flew up from the Kherson side and hovered over the pole with the flag. Yulia started to wave at it. The military boat returned. It turned out to be a Ukrainian military boat. The guys from the boat transferred Yulia, attached two other boats, and towed them to the shore.\n\nAndrii took out his phone to film a video.\n\n# “This is what freedom looks like,” he said, looking at the green slope of the port city.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1k7tallpl85d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab511388c05b7045fc539af05f5874afbce3bfb\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 836th day of a nine year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Since 1945, no internationally recognized state was wiped off the map by external conquest. Russia is trying to do just that to Ukraine. Putin is following the imperial principle that any territory conquered by the Russian army is annexed by the Russian state. If Russia wins, no state and no border could feel secure, and the world will enter a new era of imperialist wars of conquest. The Global Peace Summit that will convene on June 15 in Switzerland is a crucial chance to restore peace and order. I urge world leaders to attend the summit, and together bring peace to Ukraine and to the world.

My napkin math says we've written something like 84 food posts since February, 2022 and a significant fraction of them have included recipes by this one enigmatic chef.\n\nBut it's no mystery... it's because **Yevhen Klopotenko** is one of Ukraine's most well-known and dedicated cultural ambassadors and popularizers of traditional Ukrainian cooking - both within Ukraine and abroad.  He also happens to be quite generous with the many free recipes posted on his website, klopotenko. com.\n\nThis chef is also worth supporting for reasons beyond just getting cool recipes.  In 2020, he launched an initiative to get Borshch recognized by UNESCO as being a part of Ukraine’s Intangible Cultural Heritage - and succeeded in doing so.  This was an important step in pushing back against russian aggression and disinformation (you shouldn't be surprised that russia spent an incredible amount of cultural resources trying to appropriate the heritage of Borshch from Ukraine).  Chef Klopotenko has also worked towards modernizing school lunch menus for Ukrainian children.\n\n[Yevhen Klopotenko](https://preview.redd.it/d4sa4psw7n4d1.png?width=1902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c46bf32f4f5a1f2f6aab529bd6cead1fc9e4657a)\n\nDespite his busy schedule, he managed to come to r/Ukraine for an AMA last year and ended up answering a TON of community questions about Ukrainian cuisine:  [Klopotenko AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/12zsd1y/im_ievgen_klopotenko_chef_from_ukraine_i_made_a/)\n\nMy favorite AMA response he gave was:\n\n&gt;In terms of support, I believe that cooking Ukrainian dishes is a significant contribution to preserving Ukrainian culture.\n\nWell, since he has been so kind as to share so many of his recipes for free online - and because so many community members have been so kind as to cook Ukrainian food using some of those same recipes we've shared in our posts - we wanted to dedicate this post to his new book!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Yevhen is a powerhouse: You can feel his presence when he walks in the room. He is one of the chefs who is not only feeding the few at his restaurant, he is feeding the many of Ukraine. The recipes in this book are the recipes of the people, by a man who is on the frontlines of defending democracy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**- Chef José Andrés, Founder of World Central Kitchen**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Book cover](https://preview.redd.it/4i96tp527n4d1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3901ab1bbad9a6011d1767e25a37f6c3d257c9fc)\n\n**Just a couple weeks ago, Chef Klopotenko's cookbook,** ***The Authentic Ukrainian Kitchen: Recipes from a Native Chef,*** **was published in English.  This volume is 288 pages of pure, unadulterated Ukrainian flavor in the form of 100 recipes and photos.  It also includes culture and historical context.**\n\n**All the classics you'd expect are included, but there are some notable twists and it also covers many dishes and techniques that haven't enjoyed as much of an international spotlight.  I won't spoil some of the surprises for you, but it really is a nice collection.**\n\n[Recipes in the book.](https://preview.redd.it/86du7u07gn4d1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d87b7fdbc1d1aeb4cc339454d466e9c5ce78a2b5)\n\n*The Authentic Ukrainian Kitchen: Recipes from a Native Chef* is available online from all the places you'd expect, but please consider buying directly from the publisher (**I will put a link in the comments**) or supporting your local bookseller!\n\nHere is the ISBN for your searching pleasure:  9780316559492\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Смачного!\n\n**Part of our series on Ukrainian recipes!

Great selection of dishes, though more desserts than I expected. Maybe that is just because I don't have much of a sweet tooth.\n\nWhat impresses me most is how well the book is laid out. Almost every recipe is kept to a single page, with a photo of the dish on the opposing page. This makes such a difference in a practical cookbook: you can see your steps and ingredients at a single glance together with a visual of the finished result. None of this flipping-back-and-forth-while-you're-cooking nonsense, losing your place and getting red pepper puree and beetroot stains all over the pages (which I may or may not have ever done.)\n\nHighly recommend!",

If the latest Razom for Ukraine newsletter hadn't mentioned the book, I'd continue to print out his recipes from the web which have pics interspersed w/ instructions - 5 pages for borsch if I didn't delete the images when saving.  Immediately ordered the book of course.\n\nI've made his Lviv Cheesecake several times, even making the farmer's cheese (impossible to find now even though that's what all cheesecake in the '50s used - yes, I'm really old) - impressive results!  Looking most forward to the desserts as I love baking. and soups of course.\n\nBack when we were all desperately looking for ways to support Ukraine, I bought *Babusya's Kitchen*, a 2022 published recipe book with reminiscences, made by returned Peace Corps volunteers as a fundraiser for Ukraine.  Will be interesting to compare as the volunteers were all over Ukraine, most in villages.  Don't believe it's in print any longer.\n\nMy pragmatic approach: favorite recipes found by the number of stains on the page :)\n\nThanks again!",

One in particular that got to me was a clearly starved pretty young woman (maybe 15 or 16)  who had managed to escape Mariupol after it had been under siege and made it to the Polish border. She was the only one from her family to make it out alive and appeared to have arrived at the border alone and traumatized. She was emaciated and looked like she hadn't eaten for weeks and was in a thin sweater insufficient for the cold.\n\nAnother photo I recall was of a small hatchback car with a dead cat curled up in the bottom front passenger seat and fragments of the owners teeth and jaw bone beside it. There were cannon holes in the back window from the Russians shooting through the window at a woman trying to get away from the invading Russian army and they shot her through the back of her head. Most of her body had been removed, but parts of her and her pet cat that the Russians also killed were left behind.\n\n**Putin must be stopped by overwhelming force, now.** Urge your governments to confront Putin by force now. If they're too cowardly, then to donate arms and material to Ukraine's defense and the defeat of Russia's evil criminal horde now. In the meantime, while our governments dither and fail to do nearly enough to stop Putin's expansion of his criminal empire and genocidal invasion, donate to the only armed force actually putting their lives on the line to defend Ukraine and the entire free world at [https://u24.gov.ua/](https://u24.gov.ua/)",

The bulk of the Russian forces in Ukraine are volunteers who signed up because they were offered a lot of money to fight and most of them aren't conscripts. The punishment for refusing conscription is also just a few years in prison and while I certainly don't envy anyone in a Russian prison it is both a morally better option and potentially a safer option than going to fight in Ukraine.\n\nI don't delight in anyone's death but I'm also not going to feel too sorry for the Russian soldiers who die in this war especially when they volunteered to fight or made no attempt to avoid mobilization.",

This is in part intended to be a show of support for Ukraine in fighting off the invasion, and in being a Eurovision fan I have gained a bit more understanding of Ukrainian culture and music which I've very much enjoyed. As an Everton fan I figured I'd get Mykolenko's name on the back if possible, love the guy and he's been great for us this season.\n\nI have run into a few difficulties when actually looking to buy the kit though:\n\n1. The kit doesn't seem to be officially released yet? From what I've heard I think it's just going to be the current kit - but a lot of news sites like [goal.com](http://goal.com) don't have the kit listed at all, which means...\n\n2. I guess it isn't available for sale? Joma's website is not great in this part of the world but I'm struggling to find the kit on sale anywhere that looks legitimate, which seems weird three weeks before the tournament.\n\n3. Is it insensitive to buy? Or is there some kind of current informal boycott around it in Ukrainian society? I believe Joma's deal with the Ukrainian federation ends after this tournament and I believe that's because Joma are manufacturing kits for russian club teams. If it turns out that Ukrainians aren't even looking to buy the kits then I wouldn't particularly want to get one either.\n\nHope this post sounds reasonable and not insane. Thank you in advance, diakuiu, slava Ukraini :)",

Part of it is that their industry shifted to that basis over the last 50 years; part of it is that to add a devastating \"insult to injury\", they lack the **inputs** as a country — Artillery crossed a threshold something like a century ago, where you can't just build a barrel out of regular metal.\n\nThe rise of modern metallurgy coincided right at the same time as things like Dynamite were being invented.  \"High explosives\" (dynamite being one of numerous examples) are vastly more powerful than gunpowder — obviously, if you could *put them in a cannon*, the blast being (say) 10x stronger would mean your shot would travel 10x further (not really, but we're *ludicrously* simplifying the math to get the point across).   It was an insane opportunity, but if you did this with regular metal, the blast would be so strong it'd rip the gun to pieces the moment you tried to fire, killing all the operators.\n\nYou needed a special steel that was, itself \"10x (or whatever)\" stronger, to hold together and direct the blast.   Fortunately high explosives came out right at the same time we were making terrific advances in metallurgy, and further advances in both have crept in over the years.\n\n--\n\nGetting large quantities of this special steel is really hard, now for Russia, since they shut down their domestic production ages ago.   They can get it, there's just never enough.\n\nCan they still produce artillery?  Absolutely.    Can they do a Stalin-style \"we need rows of factories churning out 50,000 of these a year\"?  Absolutely not.   **The critical thing is that it's looking like the production rate is well below the loss rate**.   The prime indicator for this is that the *spread* of gear is consistently shifting its bias to include older and older stuff — stuff that's just overwhelmingly inferior, and is stuff you'd never ever have a sane reason to *choose* to use; you'd only ever use it if you had no other choice.\n\n--\n\nRussia will never run out of artillery; there will always be fresh ones rolling over the assembly line.   It's like a bathtub, where the faucet is running, but the drain is open.   If there's more flow through the drain than the faucet, eventually that tub will empty even if the faucet is always running.  We'll eventually hit a point where they only have a small amount of artillery, like the little puddle on the bottom of any sink/tub with an open drain and a running faucet.",

Instead they burn at increasing rates as the pressure increases. So a charge at the breach as it is ignited by the primer is at zero pressure but that rapidly increases in burn rate and pressure as the projectile moves up the barrel for the 22 millisecond travel time in barrel so that the pressure is on the order of 50,000 to 65,000psi at the muzzle for a projectile leaving at 2700fps.  But you are correct the steel needs to withstand that 60,000 psi over the entire length of the barrel.",

The Swedes famously pursued building cannons out of *leather* (crimped in place with iron bands, but ... *Leather!),* and quite a few places (like Vietnam) made mortars out of very large blocks of wood.\n\n*Ironically*, this even gets a portrayal in a fairly modern Russian \"historical fantasty\" film, where a Russian settlement/Kreml improvises a leather cannon, when it unexpectedly comes under attack — this, *after* the authorities had levied all the big guns and taken them out of the town to be used where they expected the actual fighting to happen:  [https://youtu.be/7dnZTZxZBnk?t=5255](https://youtu.be/7dnZTZxZBnk?t=5255)",

They tried wrapping smaller balls with leather but the leather ripped off at the muzzle and the shots fell short. Meanwhile the British ship of the line was dismantling the town from a safe distance. Then one errant shot from a British 36 pounder went skipping through the waves and rolled up onto the beach smoking hot. That ball was soon picked up and loaded into the American cannon and a well aimed shot hit the UK ship well enough that it had to withdraw saving the town. \n\n Funny I can remember most of that story after sixty years while I can;t remember what I had for dinner Wednesday. :-(",

It wasn’t easy; he fought against russian oppression despite all the odds stacked against him.  In the end, he paid the ultimate price but left behind a powerful legacy… the legacy of a man born into bondage who stood up to an empire.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# “The Ukrainian Robin Hood”\n\n[Same as it ever was :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/cxbsic1dz13d1.png?width=1582&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b3216ef4bfb0a56273835ebee5a1a8ee1ff48aa)\n\nUstym was born a serf in 1787 in the Vinnytsia region.  Both of his parents were serfs, as were his sisters.  It seemed his life would pass too quickly in hard work, sweat, and tears while witnessing his family and other peasant folks being used and abused by the rich and powerful. Ustym was bright, so his master took him on to work in the manor house.  His native language was Ukrainian, but he also knew Yiddish, Polish, and russian.  Over time, Ustym married another serf and they started a family.  However, he refused to bend to his master’s authority and frequently irked him by refusing to obey and even talking back.\n\nOne day, his master had enough of Ustym’s disruption of the daily oppression of humans and committed him to 25 years of military service in the russian imperial army.  For Ustym, it was more or less a death sentence, as even if he were to survive 25 long years in the russian military meat-grinding campaigns - not to mention the hunger and sickness in russian barracks - he would still not be there to protect his young and vulnerable family.  Ustym was at this point just 25 years old, and his tough life was about to get much harder.\n\n[Work titled \\\\\"Portrait of a Middle-Aged Ukrainian\\\\\" that is widely believed to be Karmaliuk, made during his lifetime.  \\(1820s\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ohil5ijpx13d1.png?width=1609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3cbf6e039c87e020e8be16decbdf3056d9f93d1)\n\nUstym had no interest in giving his life to the russian empire.  In 1813, together with a few like-minded fellows, he escaped and returned to his native region.  Ustym quickly organized a band of men - people who had escaped serfdom and military conscription into the russian army - and they set about attacking and robbing the estates of the nobility.\n\nPrimary sources say the money and property seized from landlords was distributed among the poor peasants by Karmaliuk.  And when Karmaliuk would give money to the poor, he’d say:\n\n&gt;\"Take the gold, so your children don't cry at home...  And when I am killed somewhere, remember me...\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# The Escape Artist\n\nThe nobility did not tolerate his behavior; he was caught pretty quickly and was sentenced to 50 lashes, after which he was sent to a penal battalion in Crimea.  But on the way to Crimea, Karmeliuk once again escaped from custody.  His determination only grew, and things were getting even more interesting.\n\nIn 1814, he returned with fierce force and led a peasant uprising against the russian administration and nobility.  The uprising engulfed many districts in Ukrainian Podillia.\n\nIn 1817, Karmaliuk was caught once more and received 25 lashes and a sentence to ten years of hard labor in a camp in Siberia.  But Karmaliuk miraculously escaped yet again, returned to Podillia, and continued his raids.  When he was captured, using his fluency in russian and forged documents, he posed as a soldier from Kostroma during the investigation.  But his cover was blown when russians brought his little son to the interrogation, and the boy naively ran joyfully when recognizing his dad.\n\nThis time Ustym was imprisoned in the Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle (we wrote about it in great detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/10sah0f/730_eet_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_345th_day_of_the/)), and he organized his fourth daring escape, along with other prisoners.  However, he was wounded and chained to a stone pillar in what was then called the Julius II Tower (Papal Tower), but which was later named after him.\n\nIn the winter of 1824, he was punished with 101 lashes, branded with a hot iron, and again sent to Siberia.  However (you guessed it!) he soon escaped again, was recaptured, and placed in much harsher conditions.  Upon which he escaped yet again.  Seriously.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# The Witcher\n\n[Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle.](https://preview.redd.it/8zltixpy023d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e3ac6030e6f4cf97b39deb0aaad156c3c19c6fb)\n\nHis escape from Siberia is one of the most famous documented cases.  In the autumn, during a nighttime storm, Karmaliuk broke the bars on the windows.  Gathering the shirts of all his cellmates, he tied them into a long cloth (classic!).  He then tied a stone to its end and threw it over the prison stockade.  Using this makeshift bridge, all the prisoners climbed out one by one… by morning, the cell was empty.\n\nIn 1828, he was captured again after russian state troops raided a village, arresting and prosecuting about 750 people.  Karmaliuk's sentence this time was more lashes - but more important, *life* imprisonment in a Siberian labor camp.  Well, not having any of that business, Ustym quickly made another escape, and I am starting to lose count (and have long since lost the ability to describe his escapes in a non-redundant way!).\n\nIn 1830, he was caught again and placed in a local prison.  By about two years later, Karmaliuk had dismantled the ceiling of his cell and escaped.  He then organized perhaps the most potent of all his uprisings.  This peasant movement led by Karmaliuk spread across Podillia, areas of Bessarabia, Volhynia, and Kyiv regions.  To combat the insurgents, the russian government had to establish a special Commission tasked specifically with thwarting the Karmaliuk movement.\n\nIt is said that Karmaliuk was killed in a trap after being betrayed by a collaborator who was promised russian forgiveness.  It is also said he was killed with a silver button as his enemies at that time thought he was a witcher (or kharakternyk).  Many of his closest mates of all persuasions, Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews, were arrested and sent off to Siberia.\n\nUstym’s body was paraded around through Ukrainian villages in an attempt to instill fear and despair - the sense that all was lost.  But we know that it is not lost.  Yes, we are still fighting this very same war today, but Ukraine is still here after all that they have done to us.  The Ukrainian soldier is still here - each hero is a man up against an empire.\n\nIt is recorded (in part thanks to that special russian commission, ironically), that over the course of 23 years, Karmaliuk's units were staffed by over 20k insurgents and carried out over 1,000 raids.  He escaped 4 times from Siberia, returning home on foot each time (this is a truly amazing feat).  He also established strong connections within many communities and set up extensive resistance networks amongst the Polish and Jewish communities in Ukraine, and those groups often helped shelter him from searches by russian authorities.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[\\\\\"Monument to Ustym Karmaliuk, the People's Avenger\\\\\" in Letychiv.](https://preview.redd.it/dd7nf7l2223d1.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a5a8ca004893ebb1bc8093286b53adadc285d46)\n\nKarmaliuk is an undisputed hero in Ukrainian folklore, but it is difficult to discern myth from reality in cases like this.  Was he operating outside of established law?  Absolutely.  Did some people hate his guts?  Without question.  Do we know if he really gave the stolen money to the poor?  Well, how can we know, given that he operated in the shadows? \n\nBut what we do know is that subjugation and servitude were as immoral and anti-human then as they are now.  Karmaliuk's refusal to submit became an important and colorful design in the fabric of Ukrainian resistance.  \n\nSo yes, Ustym, as you asked, we do remember you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 825th day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

If you'd like to read part 1 first, [see this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/1cxq7qq/503_eest_the_sun_is_rising_over_kyiv_on_the_819th/)!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Counteroffensive in Slobozhanshchyna**\n\nThe next significant stage for the 92nd Mechanized Brigade during the Russian-Ukrainian war was the Kharkiv counteroffensive, which lasted from September 6 to October 2, 2022, and resulted in the liberation of more than 500 settlements. The operation was meticulously and long planned, conducted with maximum secrecy. For reconnaissance, they often had to drive civilian cars to the Siversky Donets River, including to establish crossings, and move personnel to positions at night to avoid enemy detection of active movements. A week before the counteroffensive, the military pretended that the Brigade had gone for recovery far from the front line.\n\nThe move started with demining the fields, followed by infantry, and then artillery. According to the soldiers of the 92nd Brigade, the counteroffensive was a burst of adrenaline for them: everyone advanced quickly, covering tens of kilometers a day. Sometimes the artillery couldn't keep up with the infantry—having just deployed and worked one position, they had to pack up and move to the next. There were even instances where Russian soldiers couldn't keep up with the Ukrainian infantry: the artillerymen of the 92nd Brigade had to engage in a firefight with Russian artillerymen. The Ukrainian Brigade was very stretched out, with each Battalion holding a large section of the front.\n\nThis counteroffensive demonstrated the Brigade's ability to conduct coordinated, rapid advances, overcoming logistical and operational challenges, and ultimately contributing significantly to the liberation of Ukrainian territory.\n\n[Ukrainian soldiers near the monument at the entrance to the city of Kupiansk as it was liberated, September 2022. Photo from the personal archive of the Commander of the company of the 92nd Guards Brigade of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.](https://preview.redd.it/jeh78hwpz92d1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d661cacba58b1e98a713cc9bb88944e5dfc38faf)\n\nFor the Commander of the 2nd Self-Propelled Artillery Division, Serhii, nicknamed \"Karat,\" one of the striking episodes of the counteroffensive was the capture of a Russian artillery officer:\n\n&gt;\"It's very rare to hear about artillery units taking prisoners. And I had a situation where the commander of the fire platoon of the 2S3 fell into captivity with my guys. That is, an artillery officer who serves on the 2S3 ended up in captivity with the guys who also serve on the 2S3. At first, he didn't believe he had ended up directly with our artillerymen in captivity.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p74nt7wrz92d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04ad041d80a026bbbbc09a67060588f181344557\n\nAdditionally, the artillerymen of the 92nd Brigade captured enemy equipment, which proved useful during the counteroffensive. The Commander of the Artillery Brigade, Andrii, recalls that Russian soldiers abandoned their positions in haste, leaving behind both ammunition and equipment:\n\n&gt;\"\\[...\\] Even now (as of late February - early March 2024. - Ed.) we are using their ammunition against them. There is even equipment that is being used against them. \\[...\\] Towed guns, anti-tank guns, portable anti-tank missile systems - they left all of this behind. We can't say 'thank you' to them, but let it be ours now. We'll return everything to them, except for samples of weapons. We'll give back all the ammunition without exception.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia71hevwz92d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05d07ead41e5216b4d415e33cbbacc3324649be1\n\nThe rapid advancement of the 92nd Brigade in the Slobozhanshchyna region boosted the morale of the defenders. Their fighting spirit was also upheld by local residents, who couldn't always believe that Ukrainian forces had finally arrived after months of occupation. Most people offered help, provided food, took care of accommodating the soldiers, and also reported on the movements of the Russians. Colonel Oleh recalls:\n\n&gt;\"Once it so happened that I, from the artillery, arrived there (in one of the villages in Slobozhanshchyna - Ed.) with my command earlier than the infantry command arrived. I arrived, but, again, there's no \\[infantry command\\], and the village was just under occupation. And I came out, started speaking Ukrainian. The women said, 'Are you ours?' And I said, 'And who are yours?' I said, 'Glory to Ukraine!' And they said, 'Glory to the Heroes!' They cried and scattered. But after five minutes, they gathered \\[back\\]. And I saw that they were sincerely happy. Sincerely happy. And then... well... literally started accommodating us in their homes. They set up a schedule of who would bring food to whom. There were such brave little women.\"\n\nBrigade Commander Pavlo Fedosenko particularly emphasizes the success of the counteroffensive attributed to the infantry. Although such results were achieved thanks to the coordinated work of the entire Brigade, the infantrymen led the way and paved the path for everyone. The Commander of the 4th Assault Battalion, Petro, shares the same sentiment:\n\n&gt;\"The infantry is the most important for us because without infantry, we cannot hold any territory. \\[...\\] Infantrymen are like a person who captures a new island, lands on some planet, on the Moon, and raises the flag of Ukraine, saying that they have territory. If there is no infantryman there, there will be an enemy. So where there are infantrymen, that's Ukraine. Where there are no infantrymen, there will be an enemy.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nit92q6yz92d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4732ac52785fa242ef4c23a8e6e683d1f502f994\n\nDuring the Kharkiv counteroffensive, the Brigade's task was to reach the border of Ukraine and then move towards Luhansk. Brigade commander Pavlo Fedosenko recalls that the soldiers managed to do just that: they almost reached Svatove and entrenched themselves about 10-12 kilometers from the city, despite intense fighting. The Brigade practically had no time for recovery - already from March 2023, they were redeployed to the Bakhmut direction. These turned out to be exhausting battles in a fundamentally different environment. Soldiers recall that it was here that they first encountered fighters from the private military company \"Wagner\" - an illegal Russian armed formation composed of mercenaries. Tank Battalion commander Oleksandr (callsign Phoenix) says that this was a completely different enemy:\n\n&gt;\"We met the 'Wagnerites.' Deadbeat, drugged-up, 'Wagnerites' who lived for weeks in one pit. \\[...\\] They were just like dogs there. They were hungry. If they were wounded, they were bandaged up, and they were sent back. Well, you shoot near them, they don't even react to that. Amphibious people, zombie people, they just spit on everything.\"\n\nHe adds that the occupiers' tactics changed at that time. Although the complexity of the battles in the Bakhmut direction was also due to the characteristics of the terrain (different relief, burnt forests that are easy to see through), fighting became harder along the entire front line. If previously, Russian fighters could be reached by artillery, now FPV drones play a significant role because the enemy not only fortifies better but literally buries themselves in the ground.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zuq2t1dzz92d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02cce9d0232b290d7cd032db59469bf906621127\n\nIn the Bakhmut direction, it's difficult to carry out any actions. Due to constant shelling, the evacuation of the wounded is disrupted, and sometimes it's impossible to retrieve the bodies of the fallen. If previously operations could be conducted at night, now the enemy improves its techniques and often targets Ukrainian positions with fire at any time of day. Battalion commander Petro mentions that currently the only relatively safe time for executing tasks is during foggy weather, as then enemy drones cannot spot them:\n\n&gt;\"During the day, you can't conduct any observation by personnel at all. You can't allow your infantryman to be classically in a trench, observing the battlefield, as it was before, coming out of the dugout and looking. Because the enemy flies drones too. And if he sees one of my infantrymen in position, the soldier can't even go to the toilet, nowhere. He has to sit like a mouse and not stick out. Otherwise, he will immediately be targeted by FPV drones, grenades will be thrown. And it will continue, continue until the enemy marks the target as destroyed. Yes, we survive, we endure. We draw conclusions from this.\"\n\nThe situation is complicated not only by the natural features of the landscape but also by the duration of the war. Our military accurately assess the enemy's capabilities and see that they learn from their mistakes and from the experience of the Ukrainian army. The Russians realize they are not welcomed in Ukraine, so they are ready to refine their skills and continue the attack. Therefore, according to Lieutenant Colonel Petro, it won't be like during the Kharkiv counteroffensive anymore.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cytdqjh00a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3183fe81ff18e1a1b91450a29294d8e67eab376\n\nAlthough the experience gained during the counteroffensive greatly assists our military in subsequent battles. For instance, artillery units learned to target and disengage quickly during this time because there were instances when the enemy responded within five minutes. Additionally, it's necessary to learn from the enemy and apply this knowledge against them. Major Oleksandr believes it's important to remember that the Russians have numerical superiority. He recalls that against his soldiers in the Bakhmut direction, they had fought against the 83rd Guards Air Assault Brigade, motorized rifle regiments, the rapid response special unit \"Akhmat,\" marine infantry, and Russian Special Operations Forces:\n\n&gt;\"Their mobilization worked wonders. There are many people, they launch frontal assaults, many bodies lie scattered in the trenches, nobody picks them up... The units they assault are the ones in defensive positions. These aren't the units that advanced 100 meters, suffered losses, and then stood 100 meters from the body thinking about how to retrieve it. A unit arrived, stormed, left. Success or failure — it doesn't matter.\"\n\nOleksandr emphasizes that such tactics are unacceptable for Ukrainians because every soldier's life is precious. With a smaller numerical advantage, the Ukrainian army must gain the upper hand through strategic thinking:\n\n&gt;\"I tell some of my officers and commanders: 'If we... for example, have one direction where we're not very strong, precisely in this direction, then we must ensure that the enemy is not so effective in this direction. If we are weak in chemistry, engineering, or in some other areas, let's make sure the enemy doesn't exploit that.' That's it, we compensate. As I say, we think with our heads, organize round-the-clock duty, observation with aerial reconnaissance tools.\"\n\nDuring the full-scale invasion, drones proved their effectiveness at every stage. In the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, they understood their value and began to develop in this direction: in 2023, they formed a separate company specializing in combat drones. By 2024, this unit had expanded into the \"Achilles\" Battalion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wwdo6r10a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a371c9e2c9b070c73fe8d063a3d60f119999c95\n\nCommander Yurii Fedorenko, in 2014, participated in the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) as an assault soldier, and prior to the full-scale invasion, he signed a contract with the Territorial Defense as a reservist. During the defense of Kyiv he was already familiar with drones but believed that using them would be costly. In May 2022, when his unit was rotated near Kharkiv together with the 92nd Mechanized Brigade, and the enemy was bombarding them with artillery, mortars, and rocket systems, they needed to find ways to see the enemy and prevent shelling:\n\n&gt;\"The battalion provided me with a group of pilots with the DJI Mavic 3T. They arrived in the settlement. We launched the drones and saw the situation: at a distance of one and a half to two kilometers from our positions, the enemy was smoking cigarettes on the street. It was already warm, May. The enemy was refueling tanks at such a close distance from us, can you imagine? It's very close, and they generally feel very free because nothing 'flies' at them. We passed this data to the artillery, the artillery recorded it as a planned target, and fired at the enemy eight hours later, when there was no longer a target there that had been detected. Understanding the quantity of ammunition lost and that this was not entirely expedient, we began to search for a tool to speed up communication.\"\n\nThe DJI Mavic 3T is a quadcopter with remote control manufactured by the Chinese company DJI. The device is suitable for personal and commercial aerial photography and videography.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f97kuyq20a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23fe205297e7017b66f21dfa7b7a4b593a020d55\n\nThen the Territorial Defense battalion, commanded by Yurii Fedorenko, got acquainted with the artillerymen of the 92nd Mechanized Brigade. The Brigade already had experience experimenting with drones. The first \"Mavics\" were successfully \"captured\" in battles, although there was no clear understanding of how to use them. According to Major Oleksandr's recollections, at that time our soldiers put grenades in plastic cups, attached them to drones, and launched them at the enemy. Understanding the brigade's experience, Yurii Fedorenko suggested that drones adjust artillery fire. The results were immediate:\n\n&gt;\"The first day of combat training: we destroy a fuel tanker. The flame was so big that it could be seen almost from Kharkiv. We disable a command and staff vehicle based on the BTR-80. We inflict damage on the personnel's location. And the enemy started to react. The enemy objectively understood that they could be targeted.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97p7u0z30a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=808a32b07dc9a9dddf9bd73307c7440ccc862443\n\nThis new system of interaction was practiced and improved right on the battlefield. Gradually, more trained personnel who \"flew\" drones emerged. This also helped the soldiers to be as fast as possible during the Counteroffensive. Drones assisted the artillery: it could stabilize on areas where the Russian soldiers were not retreating as actively. Yurii Fedorenko recalls that this happened near the village of Hrushkivka near Kupiansk, which was divided by the front line. The village itself is situated in lowlands, while to fly as far as possible with the \"Mavik\" required significant altitude. As Yurii Fedorenko explains, it was important to be able to fly as far as possible. The necessary altitude was in the forest near Hrushkivka. The commander understood that it was dangerous: there could have been enemies, but there were no other options:\n\n&gt;\"And so we fly into Hrushkivka. Enemy vehicles are still there, tanks, vehicles with 'Z's and 'V's. The only thing that restrained us enough was that there was a 'Ural' with deflated tires, but it still had ammunition on it... This indicated that our forces were not yet here in significant numbers or they somehow quickly passed through. We start to rise \\[with the drone\\] towards Kupiansk, to reach this point, the little forest. And there's a civilian car, but repainted as a military one, flying towards us. And the guys inside are like 'Hi!'. We reply: 'Hey!'. They fly by and Shabatyk (the call sign of the commander of the FPV drone crew of the 92nd Mechanized Brigade) says: 'Listen, they're totally green, did you see that?'. I say: 'Well, I didn't notice, and there are no crosses. Well, okay, these are Ruzzian guys, understood'.\"\n\nWhen the group transmitted its coordinates to the headquarters, they found that they were surrounded by Russians on three sides. It was decided to stay in place and raise the drones into the sky. This had the effect of surprise for the enemy - they did not understand how they could be seen. And our artillerymen could \"cover\" the enemy from 7:00 am to 2:00 pm, completely knocking them out of their position. Throughout the entire counteroffensive, the joint work of drones with artillery repeatedly demonstrated its effectiveness. After a successful operation on Slobozhanshchyna, the leadership of the 92nd Mechanized Brigade offered Yurii Fedorenko to create a battalion of UAVs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkfk3yr50a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08b66b7595c31623a08d4b281e3a2a5710ead09d\n\nFor the further development of the \"Achilles\" Battalion, it was crucial that the Brigade Commander believed in the feasibility of using drones from the very beginning and understood how it would help effectively combat the enemy. As a result, the UAV strike battalion within the 92nd Mechanized Brigade became one of the most effective in destroying enemy equipment. Yurii Fedorenko also noted that since 2024, there has been increased State support: if previously 80% of the Battalion's equipment was received from volunteers, now there is a 50-50 split between State and volunteer initiatives.\n\nThe Battalion is constantly learning, seeking new solutions and technologies that are still unknown to the enemy. This is facilitated by a separate engineering center, as well as cooperation with other units and brigades. Soldiers exchange knowledge, help each other improve results, and overall actively utilize horizontal connections. At the same time, the 92nd Mechanized Brigade organized its own recruiting center in Kharkiv. It is important for the leadership to find people who will be disciplined enough and ready to persevere until victory. Yurii Fedorenko believes these are the most important qualities, and everything else can be taught. Moreover, according to him, no one is sent directly to the combat zone from the recruiting center:\n\n&gt;\"After mobilization, there will be 30 days of general military training, so no one will immediately end up in the front line trenches... Such cases existed before, but now the system prevents them from happening. Or I'm not aware of such cases. The second is specialized training. If it's a pilot-operator, it's an additional 30 to 45 days on top of the 30 days of general military training... They explain how the army works, provide basic military training, explain about communication tools, tactical medicine, how weapons work, how to assault, how to defend. After that month, the person arrives at the combat brigade, undergoes coordination within a week, and can then be sent to the front positions with experienced soldiers. That is, from civilian to military, capable of performing combat tasks, it takes almost three months.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xooo99u60a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b29cb227904e92ee570eff41a08e408649f99be\n\nIn the Brigade, they want people not to forget who we are fighting and that this war will last for a long time. If the enemy is currently far from Kyiv, it does not mean that they will not be able to knock on anyone's door. Only through unity and overall preparation will we be able to drive the invaders out of the country. And real learning can only be obtained in battle. The Commander of the Reactive Artillery Battery, Oleksii, says that he gained confidence in his own decisions only during combat and only thanks to his own soldiers:\n\n&gt;\"After the first days of the war, there was such uncertainty, confusion. I was still hesitating, whether I am doing my job right or not. I hesitated to make one decision or another. Now I don't hesitate anymore. I already have countless questions, countless problems, ready-made templates, ready answers in my head. Because being a battery commander is a position that requires very rapid decision-making, very rapid composure, insight into the essence of the issues. My battery, my warriors, who grew up almost in the same conditions as I did, help me a lot with this. I ate with them, slept, experienced together, worried together about certain things.\"\n\nSoldiers of the 92nd Brigade on the front line often help themselves by thinking about home and family. According to the soldiers, they also get tired and want to return to their loved ones, so no matter how proficient they feel in the elements of war, they still strive for it to end sooner. To see their family at home. This is what Volodymyr Koval, the Commander of the Command Center  and Artillery Reconnaissance Battery, wants:\n\n&gt;\"We have one task - to drive the russians out. I don't want my children to continue this war. My child just turned 18 recently. And  when I left for war, he was 8. I don't want to meet him in the trenches.\"\n\nStaying sane also helps the support of people in the rear and the adrenaline from successful operations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66eld7080a2d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7e9258ec034c79402ac04f4a8a75ff456a629f2\n\nIn the 92nd Brigade, they also want these memories of the war to be preserved in the memory of Ukrainians, in the memory of future generations. Commander of the Brigade, Pavlo Fedosenko, believes that descendants should know about Russian aggression and learn from the experience of the past:\n\n&gt;\"Famous people have said it right: 'if you do not remember your history - there will be no country.' That is why I want the generation that is the future, that is growing up now, to remember those people, those volunteers, who defended the homeland in the first days of the war. Those who are fighting now, who perform feats. And to honor them always.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 821st day of a nine year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

Soldiers have strengthened their might in battles, trained with Western colleagues, and continue to do so today.\n\nOne of the leading units, especially during the full-scale invasion by Russia, is the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kozak Otaman Ivan Sirko. In this special documentary project \"Units of Victory,\" we talk about the brigade’s combat achievements and the fiercest battles.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Profile of the 92nd Assault Brigade named after Kozak Otaman Ivan Sirko**\n\n* Branch: Ground Forces\n* Type: Mechanized Infantry\n* Year of Formation: 2000\n* Base Location: Village of Kluhyno-Bashkyrivka, Slobozhanshchyna\n* Command: Operational Command \"East\"\n* Anthem: Performed by the band \"Tin Sontsya\" (leader — Serhii Vasyliuk, who currently serves in the 130th Reconnaissance Battalion of the Territorial Defense Forces).\n* Symbol: The emblem features crossed stylized muskets of the Zaporozhian Cossacks (yanycharky) over the palisade of the Cossack Sich on a green background.\n* Motto: \"Honor for us, glory to Ukraine!\"\n* Social Media: Facebook, Instagram (links will be provided in the comments!)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**History of the Brigade's Formation and Early Combat Encounters**\n\nThe 92nd Brigade was formed on the basis of the 6th Division of the National Guard of Ukraine, which had been part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine since 1999 and was called the 6th Mechanized Division. In 2000, the then-President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, approved the creation of a new unit—the 92nd Mechanized Ropsha Brigade of the Orders of the October Revolution and the Red Banner. Thus, this year is considered the founding year of the 92nd Assault Brigade (92 OShBr).\n\nThe unit's name was changed in 2015 when the Ukrainian army began the process of decommunization. The brigade became the 92nd Mechanized Brigade. The honorary name—named after Kozak’s Otaman Ivan Sirko—was granted by President Volodymyr Zelenskyi in 2019.\n\nThe Brigade maintains close connection to the Kozaks and the Zaporozhian Sich as part of Ukrainian combat tradition. For example, the sleeve emblem features the muskets of the Zaporozhian Kozaks — yanycharky. These were commonly used among the Kozaks of Slobozhanshchyna—the region where the 92nd Brigade was formed and is based, and which Brigade’s defended in 2022 during the Kharkiv counteroffensive. During these events of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the Brigade's soldiers demonstrated their offensive capabilities, leading to the unit's designation changing from mechanized to assault in August 2023.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3duly6h6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ff2f25ae26fabe27b9ecf4de5085bbcc0b892e7\n\nIn 2011, the 92nd Brigade, which was then preparing to protect state facilities during \"Euro 2012\" in Donetsk, faced significant reductions by the government and was slated for disbandment by 2015. However, the events of the Revolution of Dignity and the onset of Russian aggression in the East re-drew these plans. The Brigade's soldiers were able to demonstrate their effectiveness: in 2014, they participated in the attempt to break the encirclement of troops at Ilovaisk, fought in the areas around Stanytsia Luhanska, Shchastia, and along the Bakhmutka river. In 2015, the 92nd Brigade engaged in battle and captured two soldiers from the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and recaptured the town of Shchastia.\n\nSince 2020, the Brigade has been led by Colonel Pavlo Fedosenko. From 2014 to 2015, he served in the volunteer battalion \"Kryvbas,\" which was formed in response to Russian aggression by the residents of Kryvyi Rih. Pavlo participated in the battles of Ilovaisk and Debaltseve. He continued his military career in the 54th Mechanized Brigade, and later in the 92nd Assault Brigade (92 OShBr). The commander values the unit's soldiers for their cohesive work:\n\n&gt;\"This is a powerful Brigade with principles and traditions. Therefore, it was very easy to command this Brigade; there was no need to change or break any foundations. It was just a matter of leading and managing.\"\n\nFor Pavlo Fedosenko, it is important to be close to the personnel, understand the situation, and know what is happening on the front lines; otherwise, he says, he cannot make decisions. This has not changed since the Brigade was granted assault status. On the contrary, according to the commander, it adds to the responsibility as well as the prestige:\n\n&gt;\"First of all, it is prestigious for every warrior to be considered an assault soldier \\[...\\] Secondly, we are always at the forefront. Thirdly, we are at the spearhead of attacks. We are more often on the offensive than on the defensive. \\[...\\] Every warrior is proud to be an assault soldier.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8wco6fvi6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5c5e7998dcff327074a1fd1985c5100a976112\n\n**The Start of the Full-Scale Invasion: The Defense of Kharkiv**\n\nIn 2022, the Brigade faced the Russian offensive along the entire border line in the Slobozhanshchyna and Donetsk regions. The invasion was not a surprise to them; the soldiers had been preparing for months, creating the illusion of troop deployments for the enemy. They also improved the level of training for their personnel: in November 2021, infantry and officers participated in the Combined Resolve XVI Exercises in Germany as part of an American battalion.\n\nFebruary 24, 2022, was more tumultuous for the 92nd Assault Brigade (92 OShBr) than anticipated, despite their readiness for enemy actions. They had to constantly relocate and establish new positions. According to the commander of the tank battalion, Oleksandr (call sign Phoenix), the start of the full-scale invasion felt like a movie:\n\n&gt;\"We were just near the military camp, standing in a grove. The funny thing was, we were near the RAA (Rocket and Artillery Armament) depots where ammunition is stored. We were essentially sitting on a powder keg. \\[...\\] We were lying in a tent, sleeping. One of our guys came in. At that time we already heard some 'bangs.' And we were like, 'Is it like fireworks.' It was something unclear, completely incomprehensible. He turned on the light, looked at all of us, and we were already lifting our heads, realizing something was happening. He said, 'Guys, this is no f’ fireworks.'\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/open24uj6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c939f56dd2630e0cc8386f4e5792e7b05cd7b1c1\n\nThe military Brigades knew their objectives and had prepared defensive positions, but they couldn't occupy every one of them in time. The enemy advanced in a wide strip along the entire border, following military manuals to the letter. Artillery Brigade Commander Andrii recalls:\n\n&gt;\"At first, the enemy's artillery operated strictly by the book. They would bombard areas exactly as the manuals said, covering hectares with hundreds of shells, without discerning specific targets. I think they started the war using Soviet Union methods, as written in their combat regulations, showing no initiative, sparing no ammunition. They didn’t care about their own units or people, standing in a line. In the first week, they didn’t even try to hide. But I realized that when the Russians understood they were taking losses, they also wanted to live. \\[...\\] Something awakened in them, and they started to hide.\"\n\nBrigade Commander Pavlo Fedosenko estimates that the initial force ratio in the Kharkiv direction was approximately 1:10 in favor of the occupiers. Ukrainian defenses had significant gaps that the Russians could have exploited if they had wanted to. Commander of the 4th Assault Battalion Petro was surprised that the enemy did not take advantage of this. The opponent moved as systematically matching the organized defense.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bsddhbrk6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c35a24a573b039d5b16f4f0e0abd28213fa3d8c5\n\nOne of the reasons for this could have been that the Russian soldiers genuinely believed they would be greeted in Kharkiv with flowers and happy cheers. As a result, they often did not plan their logistics carefully, losing equipment due to a lack of fuel and facing food shortages. Additionally, Ukrainian soldiers were not merely retreating; they were also managing to strike the enemy, engage in battles, and complicate the advancement of Russian columns as much as they could. The Brigade's artillery units constantly fired at the enemy, day and night. Commander of the Rocket Artillery Battery, Oleksii, with his division, struck Russian forces near the village of Pechenihy, close to Chuhuiv, on the first day. He and his mates were near the Pechenihy dam when they learned from intelligence that the enemy had once again set up pontoons and started crossing in columns. The artillerymen then opened fire.\n\n&gt;\"At that time, we weren't sure about the results of our fire. \\[...\\] We fired, and I heard the shells falling, a few seconds later I heard explosions, and I heard the detonation of ammunition. I understood then that it was 100% hitting enemy ammunition, not residential houses or fields. I realized we were doing something significant. Within the first 24 hours, I understood we had hit very well. A few days later, it became clear that our Division alone had destroyed three enemy columns. These were not just 10 vehicles each; they were kilometer-long columns.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v045byql6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab14f052450553a37a29de34916ba9106e9e7816\n\nThe 92nd Assault Brigade regrouped near Kharkiv and, together with other units, maintained the defense. Sometimes, clashes with the Russian army occurred within the city itself — the enemy managed to break through from the outskirts only once (they took positions on the ring road around the city). For example, soldiers from the Brigade were among those who fought against special forces in Kharkiv Specialized School No. 134 on February 27.\n\nOne of the key operations, according to the soldiers of the 92 Brigade, was the assault on the village of Mala Rohan, approximately 22 kilometers from Kharkiv. Lieutenant Colonel Oleh (callsign Barracuda) recalls that they faced well-prepared and equipped Russian troops. The enemy had heavy flamethrower systems (known in Russian as TOS) with thermobaric rockets that disperse an explosive substance which mixes with the air and detonates, as well as Nona towed artillery installations. According to Oleh, the Russian soldiers managed to establish a foothold in a wooded area between the road and Mala Rohan, where they held out for quite some time before retreating after a battle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c3zgd4nm6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2301777478971311d2212d676e259ffec4dd0c3\n\nHowever, this assault was pivotal, demonstrating to both the soldiers of the 92nd Brigade and the Russians that Ukrainians could and would not only defend but also go on the offensive. Brigade Commander Pavlo Fedosenko emphasized:\n\n&gt;\"The entire war is difficult. It was harder in the early days to break the enemy. Transitioning to a counteroffensive, moving on to Mala Rohan—these were the most challenging moments. When we had to overcome, when we had to rise, stand up, and move forward. After we went forward, we realized that we were capable, that the enemy was not as terrifying and strong as portrayed. After this, we continue to move forward and will keep advancing until victory.\"\n\nDuring the defense of Kharkiv, the 92nd Brigade captured its first prisoners. Commander of the 4th Assault Battalion Petro said:\n\n&gt;\"Our first prisoners turned out not to be Russians, but our Ukrainians from the occupied territories. These were 18-20-year-old guys from Makiivka, Donetsk, and Yasynuvata. Students. We talked to them about how just yesterday they could travel anywhere across Europe. Their parents came to visit them from Europe. \\[...\\] And all of this ceased to exist in an instant.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtwpv0jn6w1d1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e503de0a70736fd125db2db413ac3d96ac2a1a6e\n\nHe was most surprised by the number of Ukrainians recruited into the ranks of the Russian Federation. Among the Russian prisoners, there were both experienced soldiers and newly mobilized ones. They all had a common explanation for their presence in another country's territory. According to the Brigade Commander Pavlo Fedosenko, all the captured Russians claimed they were on exercises and didn't know where they were going.\n\nIn those early days, the main thing was for Kharkiv to be defended. Major Oleksandr (callsign Skat), Commander of the 22nd Motorized Infantry Battalion, believes that it helped significantly that most of the Brigade's soldiers were from Slobozhanshchyna. They understood they were defending their own land:\n\n&gt;\"Nobody wanted, nobody, nobody even had the thought to abandon Kharkiv, to retreat somewhere, to leave.\"\n\nAccording to Pavlo Fedosenko, the successful defense of Kharkiv was also possible thanks to unity. Soldiers from different Brigades and units worked together, supported by police, territorial defense, and volunteers who promptly responded to requests, while civilians provided situational updates:\n\n# \"Everyone fought. Everyone who could hold a weapon. Those who couldn't hold a weapon—the phones were 'red hot.' People helped, called: 'The enemy is there, we see them there, we see them there.' And not just from Kharkiv, from the entire region. 'There’s a column, there’s something'—[they told us]. Accordingly, everything was promptly responded to, processed, and fire damage was inflicted.\"\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Join us later in the week for Part 2!**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 819th day of a nine year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROYAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦",

    "selftext": "**Who are we?**\n\nWe are Chosen, a collective of international and Ukrainian volunteers united by a common purpose: to resist the Russian invaders and contribute to a total Ukrainian victory. While our actions alongside the 59th Motorized Brigade are well-known, our history traces back to the onset of the full-scale invasion. With over two years of existence, Chosen stands as one of the oldest and largest foreign detachments independent from the International Legion. We serve as a beacon of global solidarity with Ukraine, drawing volunteers from nearly every corner of the world and citizens representing almost thirty nations. The majority of our members are military veterans from diverse backgrounds, having served in conflicts spanning Ukraine, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. We take pride in recruiting some of the most skilled volunteers to join our cause.\n\n**What do we do?**\n\nIn essence, we engage in combat, neutralizing Russian forces with proficiency. To be succinct, there is scarcely a mission type we cannot, have not, or will not undertake.\n\n**How do we operate?**\n\nOur operations are supported by a vast network of allies, the unsung heroes of this war. Volunteers and organizations dedicated to supporting Ukraine and its defenders, such as Protect A Volunteer, Blue and Yellow, and Prevail, provide invaluable assistance that often goes unnoticed. They offer logistical support, training, monetary and supply support. While many may assume that with all the western support, why are there groups that need to supply units? It’s simple actually. There’s a lot of soldiers that have to be supplied, Ukraine has the complicated task of when they get equipment, they have to decide who it goes to and where it goes. Often times, you don’t have a say in what you get or why. Quality can range from cheap Chinese knock off, to western standard military grade equipment. NGO’s fill the gap, with the ability to pick specifically what unit to donate to and what it is exactly they’re asking for. Not only does this enhance our capabilities, but it lightens the strain on the Ukrainian logistics system.\n\n**In conclusion,** for all those that ask themselves how could they support Ukraine without participating in the fighting. Supporting NGO’s, both foreign and Ukrainian, is the best way to support the war effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtu4stl2wk1d1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4306b22d0439c290a5f49271ee1178a4e24e54\n\nAnswering your questions today will be u/FG_Johno, u/Alex3mercian, u/ChosenCasEvac and u/ChosenDirtyP.\n\nYes, they all like cats.

I recall seeing at around 20(?) going off in one of your videos a while back and wondered how many you guys were carrying at the time.   \nHow many different types of grenade do you use? I'd imagine you'll generally use a lot of russian/soviet grenade variants due to both sides having stockpiles.  \nDo you guys have any preference on which grenade you guys use? Between things like comfort or dud rates what makes it preferable? (as I remember (one of?) your Australian \"Dave\", was calling out a dud in a video; mildly curious as to what kind of grenade it was)\n\nHow many different western weapons do you guys usually use? I've seen a decent number of what look like the Czech Bren 2s in use, but it's mostly just those and M4's  \nWould you guys prefer using the AK platform or prefer to use western guns (as a personal preference)  \nDo you find AK's or western equipment easier to manipulate when pushing trenches?\n\nBeing Australian I've got to ask, how many Australians and Kiwis do you guys have or interact with? Also do you have many members from said nations? Wishing them all well from back home.\n\nThose are just the first major questions that came to mind. Sorry for the number of them: there's a number of things I'm curious about with this.   \nYou guys are all awesome and I wish you all good luck and hope that you guys will make it home safe.   \nСлава Україні",

What do you think about the following, and do you have any other suggestions-\n\n1) Rucking 100 pounds progressively longer distances, 3.5-4 mph. Up to 3 miles without a break. Takes a little less than an hour. \n\n2) what distances are we discussing where you really need to be able to fucking hoof it with a full load? Is 100 pounds too much for this purpose?\n\n3) arm strength— if anyone else is looking for cheap ways to simulate the weight of a typical grenade/shape to throw around, the best/cheapest analogue I have found are two/three pound cannonball fishing weights. Exactly what it sounds like. Two pounds is where grenades usually top out in weight. I figure if I get my throwing muscles really strong by throwing those a couple hundred times a day, that’s a plus. What’s the most effective throw? Do you guys just end up heaving them like heavy baseballs, or is there more of a form to it?\n\n4) trench digging. No explanation needed on what’s being simulated. My wife and back yard hate me. My son loves me. My son and I are working on a pit which has turned into a pick and rock bar job through bedrock. What should I be practicing to dig trenches most effectively?\n\n5) Prioritizing training- AK platform, or NATO/Western rifles? \n\n6) shotguns- I hear there is a shortage over there, because people Are starting to use them for drones. True, or no? There are shitloads of shotguns in the US, can they be sent without violating ITAR? Would clayshooting be good practice?\n\n7) Please provide subjective boot/footwear recommendations",

But I'm gonna be honest with you dude. Being in the most hottly contested country fighting against a better equipped, much more numerically superior force requires conditioned soldiers. People who have an actual military background and served a few years at least, preferably even did a combat tour. When you fight against russian forces you need to be able to move tactically on the battlefield. You need to know how and when to look for openings and exploit them. These aren't things that you can practice at home. Only in a military training environment over a period of time. Throwing grenades, rucking and shooting are only a very small part of an enormous job, and the less of that job you can do, the more the people around you will have to pick up in order to compensate. Unfortunately a lot of people come here with minimal or no prior military experience and they very quickly become a burden on their unit. I've actually known people get other people killed through lack of experience which is tragically unfortunate but it's a huge problem here.",

I can’t really get that at home, which is why I’m focusing mainly on conditioning and things I can control. I study manuals and watch videos on small unit tactics, but I hear you loud and clear on real life experience. My assumption is I would go straight into whatever is the equivalent of boot camp upon arrival, and then assigned to an appropriate unit after training. \n\nAre you suggesting I should reconsider and not come because I would probably be more of a drain than help? I’m not coming for glory or fun, so if I’m accomplishing the opposite of helping by coming, I wouldn’t. But if that’s what you are suggesting, why would a raw Ukrainian conscript not necessarily happy to be fighting, be preferable to a civilian volunteer who is physically qualified and willing? Does it take more resources/logistics to train/accommodate foreign volunteers than Ukrainians? Is the language barrier a significant enough issue to make foreign volunteers not worth the resources?\n\nI’m really not trying to be an asshole, don’t misunderstand. I really want to understand your thought process, because it makes me think I have not considered something. If I show up and they tell the most helpful thing for me to do is dig trenches all day setting up fallback positions in the rear, so be it. If you think staying at home would still be more useful than coming over and at least digging trenches, well, you’re breaking my heart, but let me hear the unvarnished opinion.\n\nI’m training my body so it’s conditioned for extremely strenuous activity. That’s all I can really control. I don’t have an issue with putting myself in harms way; but as you said, other people’s mistakes can get you killed just as easily. I don’t want to get anybody (on our side) killed, but by the same token, I don’t want a doofus on our side getting me killed unnecessarily. I don’t have any illusions of grandeur in terms of “skills” or lack thereof. \n\nIf you are not completely discouraging me from coming— I just want to be with a unit with a mindset aligned with my own, so I don’t get stuck with a bunch of goofballs who accidentally get me hurt; glory seekers who think they are the light brigade; or losers who think they are helping by being there, but are doing jack shit. Nothing is beneath me in terms of assignments, but I would certainly want to be assigned to a unit with like-minded folks who want to get shit done— whatever it is, whether digging trenches or storming them.

        "body": "You've kinda hit the nail on the head there mate. Unfortunately Ukraine doesn't really do boot camps as such. They simply don't have the time or the resources. When Ukrainian volunteers and conscripts are done with their medicals they go straight to a unit and jump on with training for a few weeks before being deployed. Unfortunately, some dont even get those few weeks. As a foreigner coming into Ukraine, you'll be expected to bring some form of experience, something valuable to the table. Inexperienced young Ukrainian soldiers quite often need to look to us to lead the way. We're expected to orchestrate what goes on around them and that requires quite extensive experience. As a foreigner, to just turn up with the intention of helping but then immediately need to be tutored, fed, clothed &amp; sheltered without bring anything special to the table is counterproductive. It essentially just makes you another mobilised troop, which Ukraine already has a lot of. Acquiring contracts and admin stuff for foreigners is also 10x harder and more long winded for the Ukrainian admin teams than it is for Ukrainian men.\n\nAnother point you brought up was the language barrier. It can be a huge problem, even for me and I've been here since the start of the war and I can speak a little bit of Ukrainian (certainly not proficient, it's an insanely hard language to learn). Not being able communicate on the zeroline can be detrimental. Speaking English over comms devices also let's the russians know there's foreigners in the area as well which is particularly dangerous.\n\nI'm definitely not trying to discourage you, I actually admire your determination and your willingness to listen. My advice would be to join your military back home. Gain a wealth of experience. Tactical knowledge, disciplines and all the other invaluable things it takes to make a soldier. Then when you've done your time there, if you think this is still for you, you can give it a shot. You need to make mistakes to learn. Make your mistakes in the safety of your respective military. Mistakes only get people killed here.\n\nJust bare in mind mate, Ukraine is the very deepest of the deep end when it comes to the world of combat. Even the most seasoned soldiers can very quickly get out of their depth here. Nobody becomes a soldier overnight, it often takes months to even years of constant conditioning. Always listen to those around you. Keep an open mind. Work hard and become a good soldier. This war is going nowhere any time soon. It'll still be here when you're ready to head here yourself.",

I was a rifleman that ended up as pkm my last go.  So I had an AG on most ops.  Most of the ops the AG was good to go.  I had one that was absolutely dog water.  Guys train for their roles for an op for each op.  Sometimes your roles change up.  Being willing to jump into different roles is good.  Not all ops will need a 50 gunner but that doesn't mean you can't run as an at or rifle.  \n\nOur leadership is our best asset I'd say.  We have a lot of trust and brotherhood built into our unit and that bond plays a big role in trusting eachother.  Equipment would be drone support we have access to but I'm sure most units will say that haha.  If you have some good drone pilots then those boys can be better than artillery.\n\nDrones and EW are in an arms race.  I think it'll be the future of warfare for the next while until one side defeats the other.

It was translated by** u/Lysychka- **and has been condensed for Reddit.  Illustrations are from the original article, any photographs were added by me.**\n\n*By Maria Semenchenko &amp; Inha Levi*\n\nThe defense of Mariupol lasted from February 24 to May 20, 2022—86 days, 82 of which were in complete encirclement. Thousands of Mariupol residents died—from hunger, exhaustion, lack of medicine, Russian shelling, and many under the ruins of houses, schools, and hospitals. The Russians directed air bombs at, among other targets, the maternity hospital and the Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians were hiding. No wonder the residents of Mariupol say they experienced true hell.\n\nFor two years, Mariupol has been living under occupation. The Russians are trying to quickly make it Russian—both in appearance and atmosphere. On the sites of destroyed historic buildings, concrete “boxes” are being erected. Russian workers have been brought into hospitals and schools. Rebuilt housing is being sold to Russians. In the city, everyone lives with Russian passports and rubles. Meanwhile, people there still disappear or are detained and convicted on falsified charges. Those who want to leave the city must undergo filtration.\n\nFinding anyone who remains in Mariupol and can tell about daily life is difficult—people are afraid to talk. As one of the people who agreed to be interviewed for this article \"The city is plagued by fear.\" Even those who recently left the city are reluctant to talk about life in occupied Mariupol.\n\nHowever, we managed to talk to a few Mariupol residents who are still in the city or have recently left it. They spoke about what life is like under occupation.\n\n[On the site of destroyed historic buildings in Mariupol, concrete boxes are being erected. Some houses in the city are being restored only externally—for appearances. Illustration by Inha Levi.](https://preview.redd.it/bzj7ymkqvh1d1.png?width=2160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e379e2f47afba922cebef6c605afca64157ea32b)\n\nIn the first year of the occupation, Kateryna (name changed for safety reasons) would leave her house only if she had to and only within close neighborhood: to the store, the medical clinic, the pharmacy. \"When you go to the downtown, you immediately feel the oppression. Everything here is alien and lifeless,\" she says. \"Life in Mariupol hasn't stopped, but it is a life in constant fear.\"\n\nKateryna stayed in Mariupol due to family circumstances. She agreed to talk with us because she says otherwise, no one will know what is happening in the city, leading to generalizations and distrust towards those who stayed. Moreover, Russian propaganda quickly fills the information vacuum. So, Kateryna chooses to speak: \"Is it scary? Of course. But I am careful.\"\n\nInna (name changed for safety reasons) has left Mariupol. Her aunt remains in the city, but she cannot visit her—Inna's husband serves in the Ukrainian army, which means there is a high chance that she would be detained by Russian services upon entry. Inna describes the atmosphere in the city as \"stifling and oppressive.\"\n\nHer best friend remains in Mariupol, taking care of elderly relatives. \"He doesn’t tell me everything, of course. There are things you can't say even over the phone in Mariupol,\" explains Inna. \"Men often have their documents and mobile phones checked. If my friend talked to any Ukrainian journalists, the occupiers would quickly find out. Can you imagine what it’s like to live there now?\"\n\n[Caption: \\\\\"Life in Mariupol hasn't stopped, but it is a life in constant fear.\\\\\" Illustration by Inha Levi.](https://preview.redd.it/v0zv16fvvh1d1.png?width=1040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7749982dc9b302ef8ee1224f354d41eb87f5363)\n\n\"At the beginning of the occupation, few residents remained in Mariupol. There weren't even birds. Only stray dogs were dragging human limbs through the streets. People started drinking heavily, just to keep from going insane,\" recalls Anna Murlikina, editor of the Mariupol portal 0629.com.ua. She left the city in February 2024. \"Then people from Russia started coming to Mariupol, and a flurry of construction activity began.\"\n\nLast year, Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that during the blockade, the Russians destroyed 50% of the apartment buildings (934 buildings) and damaged over 38,000 private houses. They are now trying to rebuild the city—they have demolished 465 buildings, which had about 33,500 apartments, and have built about 4,600 new apartments. The Iron and Steel Works, where some of Mariupol's defenders held out, has partially resumed operations. \"Azovstal\" is being dismantled for scrap metal.\n\nValentyna (name changed for safety) did not leave the city. She is already retired. She had two apartments—one in a building with a sea view, and another in a historic building. The latter belonged to her daughter, who left in the early days of the full-scale invasion. Both buildings were damaged by Russian shelling. The building with a sea view was demolished by the occupiers. \"There is no hope that it will be rebuilt and that I will be given an apartment there. Now, in Mariupol, apartments are being given to Russians who come to work, or they are being sold. You can also take out a mortgage on an apartment that you had, which was then destroyed and has now been rebuilt. It's nonsense!\" exclaims the woman.\n\nThe building where Valentyna's other apartment was located has been restored. But to keep this property, her daughter would have to come to Mariupol, get a Russian passport, and confirm ownership. This must be done by 2026, as stated in the Russian order. During this time, the owner must pay utility bills; otherwise, the apartment will be declared ownerless.\n\nIt's not possible to issue a power of attorney to keep the apartment. Inna describes how she tried to issue a power of attorney for her aunt, who stayed in Mariupol: \"Notaries in Ukraine made a general power of attorney. Then it went through European countries to Russia, was translated into Russian, and certified by a local notary. But in Mariupol, my aunt was told that only I, and only with a Russian passport, could confirm the ownership.\"\n\nSome buildings in the city are being restored only on the outside—for appearances. Russian propaganda channels are filming stories about these buildings, where realtors show damaged apartments \"but in nice buildings and in a good location.\" \n\n**\"For Russians, Mariupol is a business project. No one thinks about the people or the city's history,\" says Inna.**\n\n[Mariupol.](https://preview.redd.it/x7ilhzdlzh1d1.png?width=2200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48fd809bd586dda99712efb19223d06a4be3bd8f)\n\nThere are far fewer job openings in Mariupol not related to construction. Jobs, especially in the service sector, are mostly given to women. Men are hired reluctantly, as few in the city believe in exemption from mobilization. Kateryna says her friend and her husband opened a small shop but did not register it with Russian state services: \"To avoid revealing data about her husband, because conscription summonses will start arriving.\"\n\nKateryna herself does not work—\"to avoid communicating with Russians.\" She sold one of her apartments and lives off that money. She recalls how she and a male friend went to villages for groceries to sell at the market in Mariupol: \"Then the 'DNR' people stopped us. They beat my friend severely. They took him to the commandant's office. They told him they would throw him in the basement and take the car. I asked, for what? And they said, for tax evasion. What taxes? There's no electricity, water, or food in the city!\"\n\nIn two years, the city has restored electricity and water supply, but everything works intermittently. \"The water is of poor quality—from the Staryi Krym reservoir. The communication lines are destroyed, so it is often turned off. The same goes for electricity. Back-up lines were drawn from neighboring settlements, but the capacity is insufficient, and accidents happen constantly,\" says Anna Murlikina.\n\n# Education: Empty Schools and Russian Narratives\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, during the siege of the city, the Russians damaged 86 out of 89 educational institution buildings, including all 15 trade schools, colleges and universities. \"The Russians are building kindergartens and schools, but most of them are half-empty because there aren't enough kids\" says Kateryna. \"There's also a problem with teachers; they are being brought in from Russia.\"\n\nSchools in Mariupol have switched to the Russian language and curriculum. Russia is printing guidelines for them—instructions on \"patriotic\" upbringing and Russian historical narratives: the princes of Kyivan Rus were \"Russian figures,\" the Russian Federation fights against \"Ukrainian Nazis,\" and Ukraine is a \"project of foreign intelligence services.\"\n\nRussian youth organizations and museums are being created in schools to \"correctly tell the history of Russia and the Donetsk region.\" Kateryna recalls May 9—on that day, she says, Mariupol schools held performances with children dressed as Soviet soldiers with St. George ribbons.\n\nThere are isolated cases where Mariupol children still study online in Ukrainian schools. But this is risky, according to our protagonists. One of them notes that staying in the occupation with children is a crime because \"in a few years, they will already be Russian children.\"\n\n# \"Mariupol residents are being drafted into the Russian army.\"\n\n[Mariupol.  Photo: Reuters.](https://preview.redd.it/abjtq3840i1d1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09407d3f00403e7a2a7a0e0e889b50683b5f3c8e)\n\n\"In 2023 and early 2024, there was no mass mobilization in Mariupol like in the fall of 2022,\" says Anna Murlikina. \"But there were individual cases. Men who received Russian passports had to register for military service. Some have already been sent to fight. I know they took students, working people aged 30 and older. But not on a large scale.\"\n\nThis spring, tents of the \"Russian Army\" appeared in the center of Mariupol. In them, Mariupol residents are encouraged to join the Russian armed forces. But, locals say, hardly anyone goes into these tents. Additionally, the Ukrainian Center for National Resistance reported that in the occupied territories of southern and eastern Ukraine, the Russians began forcing children to register for military service: \"According to the 'military commissariat' plan, from March 2024, 17-year-old teenagers must register for Russian military service.\"\n\nAccording to the Mariupol City Council, at least a thousand people are expected to be mobilized in the city shortly. Men born between 1994 and 2006 are subject to the draft.\n\nBefore the full-scale invasion, Mariupol had a population of 500,000. Now, according to various estimates, it has around 100,000 residents, including Russians and labor migrants from other countries. Some Mariupol residents have left. Additionally, during the first months of the siege, the occupiers forcibly deported tens of thousands of people from Mariupol to other occupied territories of Donetsk or to Russia. Ukrainian authorities managed to verify 33,000 of them.\n\n**According to city authorities, over 20,000 people have died in Mariupol. At least 147 children have been verified to have been killed. However, it is impossible to accurately count the number of dead. People are buried under destroyed buildings, many were buried in mass graves on the outskirts of the city, and others were buried simply in their yards.**\n\nOverall, there is no data on 150,000 Mariupol residents, says Anna Murlikina. A large number of city residents are still considered missing. \"The department store in the city center, where people died in the basement, has not yet been dismantled by the Russians,\" says the journalist. \"I wouldn't be surprised if the bodies of the dead are still lying there. People were hiding from shelling there. In 2022 and partly in 2023, it was unbearable to be near the department store because of the overpowering smell of corpses.\" Exhumation has not been carried out at the Drama Theater either, where on March 16, 2022, the Russians dropped two aerial bombs. According to various sources, between 300 and 600 people died there. Now the occupiers are building a new theater on the ruins of the old one.\n\n[Caption: \\\\\"In Mariupol, over 20,000 people have died. The exact number cannot be determined.

Some of them also happen to be Redditors :)\n\nHere's some info that they provided so you can become better acquainted (I will also link some videos in the comments):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Who are we?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are Chosen, a collective of international and Ukrainian volunteers united by a common purpose: to resist the Russian invaders and contribute to a total Ukrainian victory. While our actions alongside the 59th Motorized Brigade are well-known, our history traces back to the onset of the full-scale invasion. With over two years of existence, Chosen stands as one of the oldest and largest foreign detachments independent from the International Legion. We serve as a beacon of global solidarity with Ukraine, drawing volunteers from nearly every corner of the world and citizens representing almost thirty nations. The majority of our members are military veterans from diverse backgrounds, having served in conflicts spanning Ukraine, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. We take pride in recruiting some of the most skilled volunteers to join our cause.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**What do we do?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In essence, we engage in combat, neutralizing Russian forces with proficiency. To be succinct, there is scarcely a mission type we cannot, have not, or will not undertake.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**How do we operate?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Our operations are supported by a vast network of allies, the unsung heroes of this war. Volunteers and organizations dedicated to supporting Ukraine and its defenders, such as Protect A Volunteer, Blue and Yellow, and Prevail, provide invaluable assistance that often goes unnoticed. They offer logistical support, training, monetary and supply support. While many may assume that with all the western support, why are there groups that need to supply units? It’s simple actually. There’s a lot of soldiers that have to be supplied, Ukraine has the complicated task of when they get equipment, they have to decide who it goes to and where it goes. Often times, you don’t have a say in what you get or why. Quality can range from cheap Chinese knock off, to western standard military grade equipment. NGO’s fill the gap, with the ability to pick specifically what unit to donate to and what it is exactly they’re asking for. Not only does this enhance our capabilities, but it lightens the strain on the Ukrainian logistics system.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In conclusion, for all those that ask themselves how could they support Ukraine without participating in the fighting. Supporting NGO’s, both foreign and Ukrainian, is the best way to support the war effort.\n\n# Chosen Company will be fundraising in support of Protect a Volunteer.\n\n# The AMA thread will open on Sunday, May 19th so you can start asking questions.
