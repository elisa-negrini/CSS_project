I read this week about Ukrainian units having a lot of success here by using drone dropped caltrops (an ancient anti cavalry defensive tool that is essentially spiked metal twisted up). The caltrops pierce the wheels of the motorbikes and ATVs that Russia has been increasingly using for assaults, rendering them useless. They claimed to have achieved a 66:1 casualty ratio between Russian and Ukrainian troops here, which sounds unbelievably high.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbvlbp7ik8gf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2b2449a8d0458ddc7c3460ec22768163da1de\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtmuzfqik8gf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f89fb594646477ffa189eeec533cbb3e26f732\n\n* Russians expanded the grey zone west of Chasiv Yar, now covering the whole city, though I don't consider a city lost until it is entirely red. Still, that seems like it will happen any week now. Ukraine has fought long and hard for this city, and deserves a lot of credit for how long they have held the Russians here, just a few miles away from Bakhmut.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbkqt19jk8gf1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93327c015e2fdaa4a13cb1bd10f8a6eb9063fcfc\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf53t5pjk8gf1.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8686ab7ee5a499ef1a47ba560528798edde251ab\n\n* More Russian advances between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and it seems at least one Russian assault group made it into the town of Pokrovsk itself before being driven out.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmkcc0bkk8gf1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929b8b2d8758a2bfad4d6ce82478a6fcae6aa663\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqjib2qkk8gf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d0cb0b35cece561a2f650949744061dfe78c1d\n\n* Russians advanced here in three different places, though none of them are particularly large advances. This is tough defensive territory because there are no significant towns between Huliapole and Velykomykhailivka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump said that he is shortening the previous 50 days he had given Putin to come to the table, though he didn't exactly specify the time period (I saw 12 days being mentioned so I put that in the title). Still, he has been more and more critical of Putin and has repeated that he is the one who is blocking peace. He also threatened India with secondary tariffs if they don't stop buying Russian oil, which is very significant since India has been one of the biggest funders of Russia's war through these continued purchases. Trump and Modi have been very close in the past, so I was surprised to see him go as hard on them as he is, but I'm glad someone is finally trying to hold India to account for how much money they have supplied Putin with. India, as they love to do, is whining and trying to act like this is unreasonable, but what is really unreasonable is continuing to buy oil from a country that is killing thousands and thousands of people in an illegal and unjustified war of aggression. India is now being forced to take a side, and I don't see them ultimately siding with China and Russia here.\n* Under strong international and domestic pressure, Ukraine's parliament signed a law repealing the attempted gutting of neutrality for anti-corruption organizations. I'm still rather confused as to why anyone attempted this in the first place or thought they would get away with it, this whole thing seems like a big self-own from Zelensky, but I understand that he is under a lot of pressure from many different sides, and probably just made a bad call. Either way, it's good that they were forced to quickly recognize the error of their ways and repeal the law.\n* Ukrainian hackers hit major Russian airline Aeroflot with a massive cyberattack that halted the airline's operations and leaked tons of important documents. Russian media is now saying it may take as many as 6 months for them to fully restore their operations. Anything that causes disruptions of economic activity in Russia is very useful.\n* The Russian economy continues to face significant headwinds, as the Russian Central Bank runs out of tools they can use to continue their economic shell game where they move different debts around in order to keep the Russian economy moving. Non-military companies are facing increasingly dire economic outlooks, and British and European sanctions and aggressive enforcement against the Russian shadow tanker fleet are limiting their options for how they can sell their oil above the EU-imposed price cap. I don't expect anything to collapse overnight, but as I've said before, I believe that by the end of this year or the first half of next year, their ability to continue funding the war at the current level will be severely degraded.\n* Several major European governments are preparing to request billions of dollars in loans from the EU to purchase military equipment for themselves and for Ukraine under the new Security Assistance Facility for Europe program. Ukraine currently has tens of billions of dollars worth of military production sitting idle due to a lack of funds. If their military industrial complex was fully funded, they would be in a vastly better position, and it does look like that may happen relatively soon.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,432 (+35)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,082 (+7)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,076 (+5)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+0)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+0)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 163 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,493 (+61)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,232 (+6)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,430 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1053 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 611 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of greater overall Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russians, though it's important to note that in the most crucial categories of tanks and IFVs, Ukraine is very slightly below Russia, and many of Ukraine's vehicle losses are coming from easily replaced IMVs.\n\nThank you for reading!",

If you'd like to get these posts in your inbox every week, please subscribe to my substack, the link is in my profile.\n\n**Video of the week:**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1m863t6/video/5s8xm0xnvtef1/player\n\n* This video shows what it's like to be a bit too close for comfort to a Shahed drone strike. Russia has steadily upgraded its Iranian designed Shaheds (which they call Gerans), to the point where they are now accurate enough to be used in a strike role on the front line rather than in saturation attacks against military and civilian targets deep within Ukraine. They are still a rather blunt instrument, but as you can see here, they pack a much larger punch than FPV drones.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luhmojv7wtef1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9c421b50706486ba02c0ac53e84f6b5117042e\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgjg5gu8wtef1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541ab75bbc12a71497708ad7e0a4a06d309f86a2\n\n* Russian forces have been pushed back here slightly, a welcome change.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7c95nkdwtef1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e031b54c6a966344498844e34b7ee78c20203d\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zn3x008ewtef1.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286d4226317bad37281f28fe00e69224af7b1138\n\n* Small advance by the Russians here, if that pincer goes any further south, it could threaten the salient around Kurylivka.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plb99mjkwtef1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5594ef6111a082f003b519d4a7c02c2788fb80ba\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pobkui4lwtef1.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d59e5e1d03911d4125bce784df571a6cb5d241c0\n\n* Two small advances by the Russians here in the north of the sector.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gd6cia2owtef1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa798ceb355f1f05c6eadb44accdfc5a2b48f499\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvk32noowtef1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd99888857e440224960e60caeb4f3ad9bc103b0\n\n* Russian forces advanced in the south of this sector. The town of Kostiantynivka is apparently under constant Russian drone attack in order to disrupt Ukrainian logistics.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jcjrdqmvwtef1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=090a784396d04ccb4fe8438cc9a5e1b66d07d4c2\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzyg8r8wwtef1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=090238ee8c356b6f0c035162c88db9962d7e97d0\n\n* Russia expanded the grey zone significantly in the north of this sector, but they haven't made any confirmed advances, which is very good. The situation in Pokrovsk, however, remains critical. Russians were apparently able to advance into the city for the first time this week, though they were promptly expelled.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snshnby3xtef1.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb75dbe8d06ad57c7980f99861d1d672fb875348\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82352pj4xtef1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce4a3639d4b275e0231dad029ed9e840b1c57611\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* The Ukrainian parliament passed, and Zelensky signed into law, a controversial bill that brings robs several anti-corruption organizations within the Ukrainian government of their independence, which lead to the first anti-government protests in Ukraine since the war started. It's been difficult for me to figure out what exactly is going on with this bill. I generally trust Zelensky and don't think he's conniving enough that he would seek to reinforce his own power at the cost of the war effort, but fighting corruption is crucial for Ukraine to be able to build a good government, and independence is absolutely crucial for any organization that exists to destroy corruption. The claim of the Ukrainian government is that these organizations were infiltrated by Russian agents, who took advantage of their independence. I can certainly believe this on some level, Russia loves nothing more than ruthlessly exploiting weak points in an opposing nation's society and leveraging those points in bad faith ways to create more division. I can also believe that some individuals within Ukraine were scared of these organizations and jumped at using that infiltration as an excuse to gut them and protect themselves. I'm sure that the truth lies somewhere in between. Zelensky has since promised to do more to fight corruption, and he better be telling the truth.\n* Ukraine is turning more and more to specially designed air interceptor drones that can take down Russian Shaheds at a fraction of the cost of traditional AD missiles. Many of these drones are designed by a company run by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. They use AI in their targeting software and are highly resistant to Russian electronic warfare. I've seen claims that 9 out of 10 Shaheds that get downed in the latest attacks are hit by these interceptors, though that seems like a pretty high estimate to me. Either way, these drones are absolutely crucial to Ukraine's continued ability to defend itself from every more numerous Russian drone attacks.\n* The Pentagon announced a new security assistance tranche for Ukraine, the first since Trump was re-elected. This includes $9 million for the repair of Bradley IFVs, and also more Hawk AD missile systems. While it's a pretty small package, it's still a good thing that Trump is actually authorizing these now.\n* In another sign of changing priorities for the GOP, and how fecklessly beholden they are to Trump, many of the same MAGAs who talked shit about sending aid to Ukraine last year are now on board, and for the first time, more Republicans support sending aid to Ukraine than Democrats, with 64% in total saying we should send more. While I find it pathetic how easily they change their minds for Daddy Trump, this is at least a good sign. Another good sign was that the House overwhelmingly voted to continue providing military support to Ukraine last week, with a 353-76 vote.\n* NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the other day that Russia produces 12 times more artillery ammunition in one year that every NATO country combined, a stark reminder of the difference between a country operating on a war economy basis vs. those that aren't.\n* Increasingly, when Ukraine dismantles crashed Russian drones, they find that the vast majority or even all of the parts in them are made in China. In recognition of this reality, the EU has for the first time sanctioned several Chinese banks. Unfortunately, China has the power to completely sustain the Russian war effort on its, though right now their support is still fairly tepid.\n* The Australian M1 Abrams tanks have now arrived in Ukraine, and presumably will show up at the front reasonably soon. Australia has now provided more Abrams than the US did. These are good tanks, and while they aren't exactly a game changer anymore, each additional tank is quite welcome.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,397 (+56)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,075 (+4)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,071 (+10)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+3)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,432 (+85)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,226 (+9)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,426 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1036 (+20)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 608 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+1)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nUnfortunately, it's another week of higher Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russian ones. One thing that is worth pointing out here, which I've mentioned before, is that this is a sign of Russia running low on armored vehicles. Russia is also increasingly resorting to using motor bikes and ATVs in their assaults, which Oryx does not track. Ukraine, meanwhile, has large numbers of IMVs, both domestically and foreign produced, meaning that they can afford to lose more of them. You'd much rather have an armored car get attacked than a guy on a bike, because the bike guy is going to die with the bike, while the IMV is much more likely to save its occupants.\n\nThank you for reading.",

But Russia has a strong ability to shrug off casualties. \n\nTheir bottleneck at this point is very likely to be financial, at some point they won't be able to keep paying these very high signing bonuses and then they'll start running out of men, but when that will actually happen is unclear.

        "body": "That's a good point but here's an even bigger piece of it:\n\nThis helps Ukraine's military industry, expand. I can't overstate how important that is.\n\nThe simple fact is war needs industry, you need your war industry in order to actually make the weapons, and you need the civilian industry, in order to keep the military industry going. Without the military one, you can't fight, without the civilian economy, your country literally falls apart as its economy implodes. \n\nWhat does this deal actually do for Ukraine's economy and industry?\n\nIt helps expand it, the US will buy these drones, and in return, Ukraine gets money and technology it needs, this money and technology allows it to both expand and modernise her industry. Which frees more manpower than any weapon ever could.\n\nTo give an example my teacher gave me, 50 years ago, a farmer would need a team of 150 people in order to tend the fields, which would then be sold and then given to the population. Nowadays, to tend the same field, you need 2.\n\n2. 2 people, for the same field. That's 148 people freed because of innovation.\n\nThat money goes into Ukraine's ability to fight, it goes into their ability to modernise their industries, it allows them to focus more money onto the war effort, it allows more supplies for the front, more money to not collapse.\n\nIt also means, if that money was used for the industries, more drones, but less people, and that frees up people for the frontline, which is important at the moment, however, with more drones, you wouldn't need as many people, so more people could go to the civilian economy, which ultimately helps Ukraine in the longer term.\n\nIn the long term, over the course of 5-10 years, Ukraine could make billions of dollars, if the rest of the West wants these drones and Ukraine is willing to give them, you could be looking at billions of dollars worth of exports to the West, and that cannot be overstated how important that would be to Ukraine. \n\nIf the US buys these drones, and continuously buys them, because you can bet your sweet ass they will as they're cheaper in Ukraine than America right now. That effectively makes Ukraine have actual influence over the US. Not the kind of influence that Russia has, actual soft power that could make the Ukrainians decide what the US does in some cases.\n\nBasically, the US, and NATO as a whole, could see Ukraine do what the US did to NATO. Just on a much smaller scale related to drones. \n\nIt also means that the US, and the Europeans, would have actual economic interest in seeing Ukraine survive, as well as military interest to see her prosper, because if she falls, you lose those cheap drones, and now you're in a worse position than ever before. On top of the fact you've also lost the technology that builds those drones, because a majority of that is in Ukraine, those cheap parts? Gone. Those cheap drones? Gone.\n\nIf the Ukrainian drone production moves to the US? That only secures the Ukrainian future, because now, if Ukraine then fell, what's not to say the Ukrainian drones production continues outside Ukraine and is then delivered to the Ukrainian special service, which would still be operating within Ukraine, and has been responsible for the almost guerrilla war that has been going on in Ukraine since 2022?\n\nBasically, this deal, if Ukraine sells those drones, would massively benefit her, it would mean the West has more of a reason to keep her around, it would benefit the Ukrainian economy massively, especially during this time of all things considering she is in a war economy going into her fourth year, it would benefit her industry, her manpower, it would greatly increase her influence both across the West and in this war, and it would undermine Russia's ability to then occupy her even if she then lost. \n\nTL;DR: This could be the best thing that's ever happened to Ukraine.",

While the political situation seems to be getting better, the situation in some parts of the front seems to be deteriorating. More on that below. If you'd like to get these updates in your inbox, please check out my profile for the link to my substack.\n\n**Video of the week:**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1m29m97/video/vx8ovmi9xfdf1/player\n\n* This video demonstrates the results of the German-made Skynex air defense system as it shoots down many Shahed one way attack drones. The system is a 35mm automatic cannon mounted on truck with a powerful radar. It can track and destroy slow flying drones very cost-effectively since it only has to shoot a relatively small burst to down a drone, thanks to its remarkable accuracy. Systems like this are some of the most important anti-drone weapons out there.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2i3yk1rxfdf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d916be47e4261b06145dcc6dfb79cbcb5e4f2fa2\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyrzdz96yfdf1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4caaa4668008cbb756479547545e20d1df4553f8\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10p4o0e8yfdf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d44129de715cccf8ca9f12302d84bed8d2b6f3aa\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngdm0b49yfdf1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=524f2d85b29ebbeeb85560e73ee634f84f8db4b2\n\n* No changes here.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l06k3j4byfdf1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77bd9b971fed6f19940127e4d555cbb81fcdae2b\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bokk4iobyfdf1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0adeae5c755d30755c2a3f777eaa3ef91c384153\n\n* Small advance made by the Russians in the salient north of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjx537ngyfdf1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b84210da4fcd3f3ca31be95f933bbcd988d65a4\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsxvow8hyfdf1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fdac371d4a43265bd89f4a90be873abefbd727\n\n* Russia advanced to close a gap in their lines south of Chasiv Yar.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnpkt6nlyfdf1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf58014673b117d69648fb5cf8f029640256e355\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hfird28myfdf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ec4de0e4a3fb63e164b9d3ee614e98fabd01c8\n\n* Extremely critical Russian advance here north of Myrnohrad.

Unfortunately, they may not have the reserves to do that.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0k9w0qq2gdf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f229b741dc0c55ffe39c5f2a4f56c194976104c2\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/awv8nqer2gdf1.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9037ee1b14136edfac0dac1c442093bca89cd0\n\n* Russians keep advancing north of Velyka Novosilka, no other changes besides that.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump announced that Russia would have 50 days to come to the table with a real offer before he allows the sanctions bill that has huge support in Congress to go through. This bill would hit Russia harder with sanctions than anything before, including tough secondary sanctions in the form of steep tariffs on any country that does a lot of business with Russia, particularly India and China. Potential sanctions on India are especially interesting since they are pretty close with Trump, though they are also one of the biggest external funders of Russia's war since they buy huge amounts of Russian oil. He additionally authorized the first new presidential draw down aid package for Ukraine since he's been president, allowing hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to be sent.\n* He also announced, alongside NATO head and all-around good guy Mark Rutte, that a deal is being worked out whereby European nations will buy large amounts of American war materiel to donate to Ukraine. While it's not as good as straight up aid, this will still result in a substantial amount of support for Ukraine. The first package is estimated to be worth $10 billion, which is more than any individual aid package we sent to Ukraine.\n* France and Italy, however, have both said they are opting out of this deal, as they greatly prefer to spend money on domestically produced systems. Both countries are still strong supporters of Ukraine, but they don't want to buy American arms when they could use the money to benefit their own economies, and, especially in the case of France, already produce domestic versions of most of the equipment required.\n* Germany announced that it is providing long range strike weapons to Ukraine. Whether or not these are the infamous Taurus missiles they've been waffling about sending for years now is unclear, though it seems like it might be. Long overdue if so.\n* Reporting also indicated this week that during Trump's call with Zelensky last week, he asked whether Ukraine was capable of hitting Moscow and St. Petersburg to force Russia to the negotiating table. While he later seemed to walk back this sentiment, it shows that Trump is interested in some way in hitting Putin where it hurts.\n* I've also seen an unconfirmed report that all restrictions on the use of ATACMS will be lifted, allowing Ukraine to strike anywhere in Russia within range, though I need to see more confirmation on this.\n* A high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence officer was assassinated by individuals working for Russia's FSB intelligence service in Kyiv. This was a rare success by the FSB within Ukraine. Ukraine's SBU service claimed to have killed the assassins in a gunfight several days later.\n* According to an analysis by the Economist, in the past year Russia has gained about .038 square kilometers of territory for each dead soldier. At the rate they are going, it would take 89 years for them to seize all of Ukraine. While this analysis obviously doesn't take into account the possibility of front collapses allowing Russia to move faster, it's still worth keeping in mind when you read that Russia is advancing.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,341 (+46)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,071 (+6)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,061 (+7)\n* Russian SPG losses: 957 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 339 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,347 (+55)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,217 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,419 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1016 (+12)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 597 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of fairly light vehicle losses on both sides, though it's always a bit concerning to see Ukrainian losses be higher than Russian losses. I've also noticed that the loss rate of Ukrainian SPG systems has gone up in the past few months. They have tons of these and are able to domestically produce large numbers of them, so they can make up these losses, but it definitely seems like Russia has been able to step up its ability to target them.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading.",

But Russia is able to contest each of those steps. \n\nFinding a way to attack and degrade the Russian drone unit would also be very important, but Russia has massive numbers of drones available and no shortage of drone operators either. \n\nThese difficulties are a big reason why Ukraine has shown little to no ability to cut off and destroy major Russian offensive salients in the last year or two. When the Russians push hard in a certain place, they simply have far more resources to throw into the fight and can stomach severe losses.\n\nI think the best case for Ukraine here, unfortunately, is an orderly withdrawal from Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad sometime in the next few weeks.",

Zelensky allegedly replied that such an attack would be possible if the U.S. supplied the necessary weapons.\n\n\"Volodymyr, can you hit Moscow? . . . Can you hit St Petersburg too?\" Trump said, according to the Financial Times, reportedly encouraging the strategy so that Russia can \"feel the pain\" and agree to negotiations.\n\nThe news comes as Trump seems to be warming up to Ukraine after months of a rocky relationship, offering advanced weapons to the war-torn country via a deal with NATO and threatening Russia with \"severe tariffs\" if Putin does not agree to a peace deal within 50 days.\n\nThe conversation reportedly took place during a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 4, only a day after the U.S. president talked with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFollowing the call with the Kremlin's chief, Trump complained he had made no progress toward peace and that Putin remained determined to continue his war against Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump considers authorizing Kyiv to use the 18 ATACMS missiles currently in Ukraine at their full range of 300 kilometers (about 190 miles) and supplying additional missiles.\n\nThe outlet also wrote that Trump previously considered supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, weapons capable of striking Moscow and St. Petersburg, but their delivery is not on the table at the moment.\n\nAfter the July 4 call between Zelensky and Trump, Ukraine was provided a list of long-range systems it could receive via third-party countries, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on July 14, Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Ukraine would be receiving significant military support under a new U.S.-NATO scheme, including missiles and Patriot air defenses.\n\nUkraine has previously received a number of ATACMS missiles from the Biden administration, though it was given permission to use them on Russian territory only in late 2024. Trump criticized the decision to ease the restrictions at the time.",

If Trump is suddenly suggesting that Zelenskyy do this, I’d be wary. He cannot—and should not—be trusted.\n\nTrump is likely to complain later that Ukraine is “out of control” and deny he ever suggested this strategy. It wouldn’t be the first time he has denied support for something he once claimed to support, and he doesn’t much care if his prior support is on record, because he knows his sycophants will accept whatever he says today as the “truth.”",

He said he was also trying to arrange the purchase of another Patriot battery by Ukraine. While the actions and words from his administration about Ukraine have been incredibly schizophrenic, I do think this represents a real change for Trump as he is finally realizing there is no negotiating with Putin about the war, and that he and Putin don't have a real relationship. While I wish that this whole thing would have been less pathetically predictable and transparently about Trump's ego rather than what is right, I'm still glad that the US finally seems to be moving in the right direction.\n* On that note, the sanctions bill against Russia now has very significant momentum in Congress, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune saying it could even be passed this month. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also expressed support for the bill this week, which I don't think he had done before. When this bill gets passed (not if), it will turn Russia's already bad economic situation into a potentially catastrophic one. \n* Germany has released more details on its massive rearmament plan. They want to buy 1,000 tanks, thousands more APCs and IFVs, and large quantities of other crucial military equipment. By comparison, Germany currently has just under 300 tanks in its military, so this would triple that number. The scale of this plan is quite significant and they are clearly taking this seriously after a long time of treating their military with contempt. Merz also said he wants to finance the purchasing of more Patriot systems for Ukraine. Germany has production facilities for Patriot missiles which means it's one of the only countries outside the US that can natively sustain a Patriot capability. \n* Bloomberg reported that Russia is resorting to confiscating property from businesses in order to sustain its war effort since their oil revenues are declining so much. They have supposedly stolen almost $50 billion dollars from their own people this way. \n* Another Bloomberg report says that the EU is considering budgeting over $120 billion dollars in aid for Ukraine over the next 7 years. They are also looking at different ways they can fill the $19 billion budget gap that Ukraine is projected to have next year. \n* Russia keeps hitting Ukraine very hard with larger and larger drone and missile strikes, last night's attack was the biggest yet. Unfortunately each week sees larger attacks. Extensive damage was done in Kyiv and also in western Ukraine. \n* Ukraine is working on ways to counter this threat, however, especially with cheaply manufactured interceptor drones which can do the work of air defense missiles with a much smaller footprint and for far less money. They are rapidly scaling up production of these drones, which could be a real game changer for air defense against other drones. \n* The Economist published new estimates on casualties and deaths for Russia and Ukraine during the war. They say that since May 1 alone, 31,000 Russians have been killed. In total, they estimate between 900,000 and 1.3 million Russian casualties (killed + wounded), and 190,000 to 350,000 killed. For Ukraine, they estimate 73,000 to 140,000 total deaths in the war. These are shocking numbers. \n* Russia is allegedly planning on importing tens of thousands more North Korean troops to man their border with Ukraine, freeing up Russian troops to be sent into the country and fight on the front line. \n* Both sides have begun widespread use of drones with autonomous terminal guidance systems that allow them to attack targets on their own, limiting the ability of electronic warfare efforts to hinder them. I personally think autonomously targeted drones are an enormous threat to the human race, but I understand that in this war, you can't really take the moral high ground at the cost of your own soldier's lives. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,295 (+45)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,065 (+16)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,054 (+9)\n* Russian SPG losses: 956 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 338 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+2)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,292 (+18)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,210 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,409 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1004 (+4)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 590 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nNot sure if Oryx simply hasn't done much updating this week or something, but these are some of the lowest vehicle loss numbers, if not the absolute lowest, I've seen in almost two years of these updates, which is quite strange considering that there is heavy combat happening all over the front. \n\nThank you for reading!",

He only respects power, and he has power, thus, he feels entitled to the same respect he's been giving Putin. The problem though, Putin comes from the soviet era, where showing any weakness, ever, means you won't be respected, and could lose that power. Trump, a business man, thinks leverage is in the negotiation, where he's used to intimidating people with his shallow world salad and financial bravado. Putin, by nature, cannot agree to or even appear to even consider negotiating with Trump, or he will lose all respect, and become a target. They're both con men, but Putin has actually given out orders to have people killed in order to show everyone else that he isn't to be crossed, while Trump has just continuously tried to cozy up to Putin in the hopes that Putin will show him \"American\" respect. He's only now figuring out that he will never get that kind of respect, and his feelings are hurt. That's it. He doesn't give a fuck about a single Ukranian and he never will, and pretty much fucking everybody knows that.",

No country got through without deaths.\nThat being said, blame for US covid deaths should be shared amongst every administration since world war II for failing to make a system of free universal health care and for allowing the American population to become one of the most obese populations in the world.\nCompare with Denmark and Sweden. Similar systems, populations, etc. Neither country had huge excess mortality but Sweden kept the society more open than Denmark. On the short term Sweden had more deaths but in the end, they actually had done better than Denmark. Even in the beginning, when Sweden had a lot of excess mortality, it was at levels that would hvae made it the third worst influenza season in 30 years, had covid been influenza.\nThe only way to have better statistics is by first spending a month or two suppressing all knowledge of this new illness that appeared in your country, disappear doctors that talk about it and then make a big show of how you are working hard to contain it, announce that only a few regions got affected but most of the country never had any of it and then fudge statistics so it appears that you had less deaths than countries with 230 times smaller populations.",

On May 27, he told public broadcaster Suspilne that he was ready to sit down with both Trump and Putin.\n\nPutin has claimed he is also willing to meet, but did not attend previous talks proposed in Istanbul, opting instead to send lower-level delegates to peace discussions held on May 16.\n\nThe Kremlin has long sought to portray Zelensky as \"illegitimate\", with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in February claiming that any talks must consider \"legal aspects\" of his mandate.\n\nTurkey previously hosted direct peace talks in March 2022 and has remained one of the few countries with open lines to both Kyiv and Moscow. The latest round of direct talks on June 2 was held in Istanbul.",

According to a diplomatic source cited by AFP, the talks between Zelensky and Trump were scheduled for early afternoon, with both sides finalizing the agenda.\n\nThe two leaders are expected to discuss Ukraine's planned purchase of a new defense package, including air defense systems, as well as additional sanctions on Russia and an international price cap on Russian oil.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing at The Hague on June 25, Trump was asked by a reporter what he would be discussing during the meeting with Zelensky.\n\n\"Obviously we'll be discussing his difficulties, he's got a little difficulty,\" Trump replied.\n\n\"Zelensky is a nice guy, I'm going to meet him today. I don't know, I assume we're going to be discussing Ukraine. It seems the most likely,\" he added.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on what he meant by \"difficulties\" but the NATO summit comes at a time when U.S. support for Kyiv is waning, and just a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared \"all of Ukraine is ours.\"",

As Buffet used to say, \"Never bet against America\".  Under Biden, the economy grew about 2.8% a year and the economic indicators were all good.  There was a temporary rise in inflation due to the after effects of the pandemic followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Growth and moderate inflation - handled right - could have slowly reduced the debt.\n\nYet all that American voters whined about was how poor they were, how they were suffering and how much eggs cost.  People like Trump and Musk will never be the solution.  They are always part of the problem.   Because of them \"never\" has happened.   Growth for this year is projected to be at best 1.6% with inflation rising to 4% or more.   For the first time in a generation US Treasury Bonds have lost their AAA status.   Next year will be worse.  The yield is just going to get worse and worse as folks lose confidence in bat-shit crazy Uncle Sam - massively increasing the cost of servicing the debt.\n\nTrump is making all Americans poorer - with the exception of his family, his cronies and the super-rich.",

This is by far the most dangerous area of the front right now, and it's not good that Ukraine seems to be having a lot of trouble with containing Russian advances here.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suvxd1aldq3f1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8cb63ca4458ab1e13bdb6f334f96b4488ca25be\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk4k1nyldq3f1.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48923114cff7f1f97be706a85342002e91edd384\n\n* Russian troops advanced again north and west of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump made several disparaging posts about Putin on Truth Social, including making a barely veiled threat that things would be much worse for Russia if it wasn't for him (not exactly the brag that he might think it is). He did also needlessly criticize Zelensky again in one of these posts and said he would give Putin another two weeks to come to the table with a real deal before he starts pursuing sanctions. It is beyond pathetic that he keeps making these strong statements only to follow them up with more appeasement and lack of real pressure, but I do think that at some point he will fully realize that Putin has been playing him this whole time.\n* Russia, meanwhile, is \"negotiating\" by hitting Ukraine with bigger and bigger drone and missile strikes each week, killing civilians and making peace more difficult.\n* Ukraine is, however, able to respond with large, damaging drone strikes of their own, including a direct hit on a factory that makes cruise missile components a few days ago. Ukraine's long range drone strike capability keeps getting better and better, and I do think that at some point in the next few months it will reach a tipping point where they have degraded Russian air defense stockpiles enough that they will be able to really do significant damage to the Russian war effort with these strikes.\n* Ukrainian reports have indicated that Russia continues to produce more and more strike drones, and they may soon be able to launch 500 per day, which would be very difficult for Ukraine to counter.\n* German Chancellor Merz announced that in consultation with the other Western allies, all restrictions on range for the use of Western weapons in Ukraine have been lifted. This could soon be followed up by an announcement that Germany is delivering Taurus missiles to Ukraine (though this could also happen without an announcement). Germany also said they were beginning their process of greatly stepping up military aid to Ukraine, including a large multi-billion-dollar package that is being sent right now.\n* One report I saw this week claims that Russia has been able to modify its Iskander ballistic missiles to make them harder to target, both by allowing them to make course modifications in flight and using radar decoys that the missile is able to launch itself. We've seen some more successful Iskander strikes in the last few weeks including one on Ukrainian troops training in the open (which should never have been allowed to happen), and these modifications might play a big part in that. In war, if you're not constantly improving your stuff, you're losing, and that idea is not lost on either the Russians or the Ukrainians.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,968 (+163)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,029 (+42)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,997 (+37)\n* Russian SPG losses: 942 (+6)\n* Russian SAM losses: 332 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 141 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+1)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,017 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,194 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,376 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 949 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 561 (+5)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nA bit of a return to the mean today, with Russian losses spiking heavily due to their offensive, including one of the highest weekly tank losses I've seen since I started this project. Ukrainian losses are still relatively high but are now dwarfed by Russian ones.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading and for your support!

It's insane they think they can take a major city back like Kherson. \nIt's sad that 1-2 losses aren't sustainable for Ukraine as those are impressive given they have to rely on a smaller economy. The upside is that Ukraine lost primarily cheaper IMV's that can be made from civilian donations while Russia primarily lost expensive vehicles. \n\n\nPay attention what leaders do not what they say- Trump is just leading everyone on.  The assumed position should be that he doesn't want to do sanctions and that threats should be ignored.

In this video he shows how dozens of locations where major Russian units are based in have been completely emptied out of vehicles as they have all gone to fight in Ukraine. Seeing the images of the full bases side by side with empty ones is quite eerie.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mylwmei7hc2f1.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f7915c60161717a8ffccce6d8d250aa9a60b05\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l34kr7r8hc2f1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaec3dcf3a528d71f9c73795d72072b0e80f6950\n\n* No changes here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrsby2bchc2f1.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3673cfbb01ebc05f551872589479b19999d9d9a2\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqk1zltdhc2f1.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d705bb8b361d9460eca868c2b16d091a61d3f30\n\n* No changes here either.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w1h5zyghc2f1.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08d9929404c0833f5a696a4aea1b466a6d64173\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/308pm42ihc2f1.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c184bee27d6e3a65d328af3b5bd7ede1683c72a\n\n* Russian forces advanced north of Lyman, and expanded the grey zone east of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q34gbh8rhc2f1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf6310c992fb4011649d2e3d9e20c5efcc75dfa\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07vb2oeshc2f1.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb1fdd8fad1ac015fa370028ac668d84cfdd1fd\n\n* No changes here.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkrgt55vhc2f1.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bea10b14fcbcc52cd6313ebbbd9ba783d1deae7\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ef2lzcwhc2f1.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca3dff338182cd7950b8b90a2b6453b0f21ffdf\n\n* Russian troops greatly expanded their salient east of Pokrovsk, though it seems a Ukrainian counterattack was able to retake some ground. Pokrovsk is now threatened with encirclement, and the defense of Toretsk may also be put in jeopardy by these advances. Things are very precarious in this area at the moment, and Ukraine needs to send in some reserves to stabilize the situation ASAP.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vfo5rddic2f1.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80edfecda45ccd4cefba79f45a600f32d356070b\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7a6rorpeic2f1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e921cf9799e30f0f7797871720c464107e6ce83e\n\n* Russia advanced north of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump had a two-hour conversation on the phone with Putin this week. He spoke with the leaders of several European nations and Zelensky immediately afterwards, where he shocked them all by saying that Putin was now ready to begin negotiations even though Ukrainian and Russian diplomats had already met in Turkey last week to start those discussions. He also repeated baseless statements that Russia is winning the war, and, according to the Washington Post, privately told officials that Putin actually has no interest in coming to the table. It is totally unclear what Trump is actually pursuing, or who's side he is on, and the common adage about him that he parrots whatever the last person he spoke to said to him seems to be holding true here. But if there's one thing that has become abundantly clear, it's that Trump's entire negotiating \"strategy\" if you can even say there has been one, has been a complete failure and has made him look like even more of an idiot than he already did.\n* In a show of how little Russia cares about Trump's peace overtures, they launched their largest drone strike ever against Ukraine the night of May 17th, killing civilians and causing damage all over the country even though many of the drones were shot down.\n* In response, Ukraine launched what some reports have said is their largest drone attack against Russia ever, with hundreds of drones shutting down the Moscow airport and hitting oil refineries in Ryazan. One thing I do wonder is to what extent these mass attacks are causing attrition to Russian stocks of air defense missiles. Their stocks are obviously very deep, but you can only shoot down hundreds of drones a week for so long. I haven't seen any indications yet that they are having trouble supplying their AD units, but it's something I'm watching for, especially as Ukraine continues to produce more and more drones.\n* Pro-Ukraine candidate Nicosur Dan won the presidential election in Romania against the pro-Russia and anti-Europe candidate George Simeon. This is a big win for Ukraine as Romania is a very important base for incoming aid and is one of the only EU countries that shares a border with Ukraine. The Romanian parliament then also passed a bill allowing their military to shoot down Russian drones that enter their airspace.\n* New polling from Harvard/Harris shows that a solid majority, 62%, of Americans support continued military aid deliveries to Ukraine.\n* EU nations agreed in principle to a $170 billion dollar fund to finance European defense. The money will be raised by EU level borrowing and then loaned to countries (including Ukraine) for the purposes of strengthening their national defense and arms industries. This is a lot of money, and if it's spent wisely could have a significant effect.\n* Meanwhile Denmark, which is easily one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine in Europe, announced another big aid package for Ukraine, worth $600 million dollars, containing self-propelled guns, artillery ammunition, and parts for F-16s, all very important contributions.\n* Some of the 49 Australian M1 Abrams tanks promised by that country are already in Ukraine, while the rest are on their way. This is more tanks than the US gave when it sent Abrams, though the Abrams has not exactly been a game changer, and the logistical problems it comes with are significant. But more relatively modern Western tanks are still desperately needed, so this shipment is very welcome.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,805 (+48)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,987 (+4)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,960 (+24)\n* Russian SPG losses: 936 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 331 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 141 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,940 (+67)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,184 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,372 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 932 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 556 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nRelatively light losses on both sides this week, though it's never good to see the Russians have fewer losses than the Ukrainians. I expect numbers on both sides, and particularly for the Russians, to rise greatly next week as the Russians launch more attacks.",

China is already waiting to invade Taiwan, and are slowly stepping up support for the Russians. They don't want to see Russia lose the war, and open European involvement could easily push them to both step up their military and financial support for Russia and accelerate their timeline for invading Taiwan, which would potentially trigger a US response, and there you go, World War 3. \n\nAlso, European nations directly fighting on the front lines in Ukraine would mean Russia would have the right to attack European military bases with missiles. Then one of those countries triggers NATO article 5, and there you go, World War 3 again.\n\nI understand that doesn't feel fair to you. And you're right, it's not fair. But life isn't fair, and geopolitics certainly isn't fair.

The war technically ended right there with a DMZ similar to what the Koreas have, and it was written off as a job well done.\n\n The North waited two years after the U.S. left and made re-entry into the war illegal before they attacked the South again and the ARVN simply folded in half with little effort.\n\n Funny enough the reason the battle of Saigon took as long as it did is because when Operation Whirlwind was happening the NVA was in full hysterics because all they saw were waves of U.S. military helicopters over the city going back and forth and they thought a full fresh wave of U.S. ground forces were being redeployed rapidly and they knew they didn't have the manpower or resource to take on a freshly rested American military. \n\n As the evacuation operation finished up and the NVA pushed in, Northern and Southern forces were actually walking up to each other with terms of surrender which caused mass confusion. \n\n In the end Vietnam realized they were on the wrong side when their communist brothers in China invaded them next and they watched as U.S. backed South Korea and Japan exploded into world leaders both in technology and economy with the full protection of the U.S. military. It's kind of why they're now requesting the U.S. navy to port at their docks and sell them weapons to deter Chinese aggression. \n\n People like to bring up the Vietnam War a lot to mock the U.S. military when the entire conflict was a full master class of pure military domination.

Partially, Trump does it this so that in the event of peace, he can claim all of the credit for it to the annoyance of the parties as in India/Pakistan.

If he is betting on staying power, he has likely already beaten America.\n\n\n**But Russia is not fighting America. It seems that Putin has drunk his own propaganda**. Putin seems to think he is fighting Anglo-America and the EU. He plans around assumptions that are fever dreams. Because Putin refuses to accept the simple idea that Ukrainian nationalism exists. \n\n**Putin is fighting Ukraine. And here his strategy seems like nonsense**. Motivation matters in war, where soldiers are expected to make the largest sacrifice. Nationalists fighting with backs to the wall against imperialists have a very clear war aim. They usually have higher motivation and staying power, especially in the modern age of mass media and self-determination expectations. Historically, if I was betting on this sad war, odds say Ukraine can outlast one old tyrant. If Russia’s conscripts refuse to die in Ukraine, Russia loses. But even if Ukraine’s army collapsed tomorrow, all that would win for Russia is the largest insurgency since WWII.  \n\nOdds of who can outlast who, do not favor the nation whose invading soldiers did not even know what they were fighting for.",

Time in control, time alive, time to keep playing things along to see if something breaks his way unexpectedly, time to delay the Russian people realizing just how horrifically he has fucked them and thus avoiding them rising up to murder him just like the Libyans did to Qaddafi, who died like a dog in a ditch. He has pushed things so far that there simply is no graceful way to back down with inviting unrest and regime instability.\n\nFundamentally, Putin is holding out because he thinks he can get a better deal entering peace negotiations at some point in the future (or never) than he can get right now. The costs to him of peace include increased regime insecurity. The benefits of the peace are limited to a fraction of what he hoped to achieve in Ukraine and represent a crushing humiliation for Russia compared to the expectations for their military performance pre-2022. The costs of continuing war are just more dead, ordinary poor Russians that Putin doesn't care about. The benefits include opportunities to seize more land and resources while further destabilizing the western political order that Putin so deeply fears and despises. He also maintains wartime control over the Russian people, including extraordinary powers over propaganda and internal security that represent dramatically curtailed civil rights for ordinary Russians compared to the much greater freedoms they enjoyed a mere 15 years ago, or even just before the full scale invasion, after which the Russian security services started tightening the screws on dissent aggressively. Also, the more soldiers that die on the front, the fewer veterans the Russian state will have to pay to rehabilitate, and the fewer potential disaffected Decemberist-style revolutionaries to threaten his regime. \n\nAnd right at this particular moment, the US negotiating strategy is remarkably stupid, in that it not only does not remove Putin's incentive to hold out, rather it actually enhances that incentive greatly. Trump has presented Putin with a win-win situation if he delays negotiating longer. Either he receives further concessions from Trump as Trump desperately struggles to bribe Putin to agree to a ceasefire, or Trump gets angry and washes his hands of the situation, leaving Ukraine and Europe at large with substantially reduced American security support and involvement. Either result would be an enormous victory for Putin.\n\nPutin would **love**--and in fact **is loving**--to see the US withdraw from participating in European security by rhetorically and financially backing away from its support for Ukraine and for NATO, while drawing down the US troop presence on the continent. He sees the western order fracturing, with Europe too weak to stand up for itself and America too broken and stupid to protect the world order it created and which has ensured its geopolitical hegemony for decades. Why negotiate with an opponent who is in the middle of a self-destructing? If holding out only either increases the likelihood of the US abandoning Ukraine and Europe or of Russia receiving inordinate concessions from Trump, there's absolutely no reason for Putin to settle now, and plenty of reason to want to delay.",

        "body": "I debated starting a separate discussion thread, but I think it would be removed. The issue I am seeing at the moment is that russia is winning.... the information war. In different subreddits, youtube and comment fields in other fora, there is a shift to a \"russia is winning, this needs to end\" view, which is conveniently the common russian talking points. My question is, why do you guys think this message is gaining traction? It is not _just_ bots.\n\nThe way I see it is, yes, the US is a huge disappointment, but the combination of increased domestic production of weapons in Ukraine, the increase in production and donation from European countries, and the mostly European funded projects like the Czech ammunition initiative makes this mostly a moot point. The gap is anti air ammunition, and primarily Patriot missiles. At the same time that the influx of arms seems to actually significantly increase, russia is showing signs of actually in practice having run out of readily fixable equipment from soviet storage. Explaining the massive numbers in \"vehicles\" lost compared to tanks/IFVs/APCs. Ukraine has a formidable experience and drone army, and the current attempts at armored breakthroughs have been thoroughly smashed. The russian loss rates for each square meter gained has been steadily rising. Ukraine is heading towards artillery parity in available ammunition, and russia has never managed to make any significant captures without massive artillery dominance. So I, as a first rate armchair general, don't see any other outcome of the famed \"russian summer offensive\" than a failure, and a final culmination of the russian offensive actions. As long as Ukraine holds on, and support continues, the situation for russia will only get worse.\n\nSo why is the russian propaganda so effective?",

This despite the fact that Sybiha (Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs) was already in Ankara, but since there's no Putin the only thing worth discussing with a low-level delegation is a ceasefire, and they won't get Ukraine's MFA either.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Putin clearly snubbed the high-level US delegation. When asked about it, Trump had this take:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1knh21n/video/gsesw2g3yz0f1/player\n\nRelatable translation:  \n\\- Jennifer do you want to go to the dance?  \n\\- No, go away  \n\\- I wasn't even planning on going to the dance. I don't even want to go to the dance. Jennifer will come around eventually.\n\nNow Rubio is echoing Trump, and says nothing can be resolved until Trump and Putin meet in person: [https://youtu.be/BsTpOFE8ciM?si=PdCDo0q\\_EZz0v7P2&amp;t=34](https://youtu.be/BsTpOFE8ciM?si=PdCDo0q_EZz0v7P2&amp;t=34) (0:34 seconds).\n\nThis is infuriating, pathetic, and a continuation of Trump undermining the united front presented just a week ago by Ukraine, European allies, and as they thought then, the US.",

    "selftext": "Hope everyone reading this is doing well today!\n\n**Video of the Week:** \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1khrum1/video/o3wfblm6ekze1/player\n\n* This video, taken by a Ukrainian naval drone, shows a Russian Su-30 multirole fighter being shot down over the Black Sea by an American supplied Aim-9 missile launched by the drone recording the video, or possibly a different drone. Ukrainian leadership claimed that they shot down another Russian plane at practically the same time, in the same way. This is the first time in history an unmanned vehicle has shot down a fighter jet. The fact that they apparently destroyed two means they must have really caught the Russians with their pants down. \n\n**Maps:** \n\nSumy last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luso94n1fkze1.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3b14bc8886c566fa34578530dcd00e6887635b\n\nSumy this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41y69vx2fkze1.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c38eb3125c4e62b3eef9cc2f3eb55b1227b208\n\n* No advances by Russian forces here this week. I've seen some reports that Ukrainians made another advance into Kursk here, but it's not on the map, so isn't confirmed. \n\nKupiansk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6087fdbcfkze1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38af01c199f11a203b89f6da0b0c30bdb55fca7\n\nKupiansk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vhdh8ksdfkze1.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97367bde91089da423483739df8ba045731186c9\n\n* No changes here. \n\nLyman last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhuno2ogfkze1.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d421f31c7a7d00328fe3b41d201a161ae29cb43\n\nLyman this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y195j49ifkze1.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be383d0f4c42f028102f537338f7987c906f2f66\n\n* Russian forces made very small advances north of Siversk and northeast of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5gopgisfkze1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95c29b437d3540ed8aba70f22660ebd2919752a\n\nChasiv Yar this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o203r73ufkze1.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d94465c9232ce2aa9cffaafeba6cd9e4f260f0c\n\n* Russia took a reasonably substantial chunk of territory north of Chasiv Yar this week. Remember that this screenshot is more zoomed in than the others, so this looks bigger than it is. Still, it's the first change we've seen here in a while. Fortunately the advance was not actually within the city, so it's unclear if this represents any kind of real change in the status quo here. \n\nPokrovsk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keqfv4r5gkze1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d305c56aecb792552952b69ef098e12127713a7\n\nPokrovsk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s62sns07gkze1.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14cb26e4d6be12e0f2b7a7f805dc2214a345645a\n\n* Russia advanced southwest of Pokrovsk and also made a major breakthrough of Ukrainian lines between Pokrovsk and Toretsk. This is the first breakthrough we've seen here in a while. Strong Ukrainian units have been sent to contain the advance, but if it gets much further it could seriously imperil the fight for Toretsk. Russia has been pushing very hard here for quite some time, so it's not unexpected that they would finally see some success, but still, it's not good that this happened. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbnkk1ppgkze1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a13888d76b80aa7368430c8db89b892c9f70582\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gve9gr5rgkze1.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658ab3189f85faf22a01729a97f24677f8cabeef\n\n* Russia took a chunk of territory west of Velyka Novosilka, no changes here besides that. \n\n**Events this week:** \n\n* A wave of hundreds of Ukrainian drones hit targets all over Russia yesterday, shutting down the Moscow airport right before the Russian Victory Day parade, which is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Military airfields near Moscow were also hit, as were key industrial sites including the biggest producer of fiber optic cable in Russia, which sustained a direct hit and major damage. Drones using fiber optic cables have become crucially important all over the front, so hitting the factory that produces the cables is very clever. \n* Russia responded with their own wave of drone and missile strikes against Ukraine, killing civilians in several different places. Ukrainian air defense is being stretched to the limit at the moment, though they are set to receive more Patriot batteries soon, and hopefully enough interceptor missiles to allow them to engage more targets. \n* Probably due to fear of Ukrainian strikes at the parade itself, several world leaders who were set to attend have dropped out, including the president of Azerbaijan, which has fairly close ties with Russia. \n* The Trump administration has shown even more frustration with Putin and Russia, with Trump saying Putin wants \"all of Ukraine,\" and JD Vance saying that \"the Russians are demanding too much.\" Russia did have a real chance to play the Trump administration and get a relatively favorable peace deal out of them, but they are too rigid and beholden to their maximalist war goals to take advantage of that opportunity, and now I do think they've missed their chance. \n* Reuters is also reporting that the cut off of US aid to Ukraine that happened after the Oval Office fight between Trump and Zelensky was not ordered by Trump. Apparently Defense Secretary and known idiot Pete Hegseth ordered it on his own, before being overruled a week later. Hegseth has got to go, and this is just the latest reason why. \n* Staunchly pro-Ukraine German leader Friedrick Merz was officially inaugurated as Chancellor, after unexpectedly losing the first vote. He is keeping on Boris Pistorious as defense minister, who is one of the biggest champions of Ukraine in Europe. I expect that German military support for Ukraine will grow dramatically in the next year.\n* Czech leader and extremely strong Ukraine supporter Petr Pavel announced that the Czech initiative to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine has grown even further, with potentially up to 1.8 million total shells being delivered by the end of this year, an increase of 300,000 over what was planned before. This initiative has been hugely successful and is one of the biggest reasons why Ukrainian artillery has been much closer to parity with the Russians so far this year.  \n* French news reported that the production of the highly capable AASM Hammer precision guided bombs has reached 1,200 per year, with every single one of those bombs due to be supplied to Ukraine. The Hammer has a very good inertial guidance system that allows it to still be accurate even in an environment with lots of jamming and EW. It's been a huge help for Ukraine, and the fact that France is rapidly scaling up production and sending all of them to Ukraine is really good. \n* Global economic pressure has led to falling oil prices, which will impact Russia very negatively. The price that Russian oil is selling at is already 40% below the target their budget set, and OPEC + is close to allowing members to further increase production, which would of course send oil prices even lower.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,648 (+98)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,970 (+23)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,800 (+16)\n* Russian SPG losses: 928 (+5)\n* Russian SAM losses: 323 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 140 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,805 (+54)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,167 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,353 (+3)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 902 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 542 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nReasonably light losses on both sides this week. It is pretty unusual, however, to see more tanks lost than IFVs on both sides. I've also noticed that Ukrainian SPG losses have been fairly high the past few months, though that could be in part because they are now producing many Bohdana SPGs domestically, meaning they don't have to be quite as careful with them. \n\nAs usual, thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them!",

Some ground was retaken directly south of Pokrovsk, and also within Toretsk. The battle for Toretsk has been a horrific meat grinder for the Russians, and the fact that the fight for the city continues, and they don't even seem to have much of an upper hand, is a bad sign for them. There were also reports this week that Russian forces tried a massive motorcycle attack against Ukrainian positions near Pokrovsk, which was completely destroyed by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed almost 100 motorcycles, 21 armored vehicles, and dozens of Russian soldiers. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7mp1rrypswe1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6815c4821a5a7737e21040352ea9c92a300310d1\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8vh9rh0qswe1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a0241559f71dec862201c2042fdddb97270b1b\n\n* No changes here. \n\n**Peace Deal Analysis:**\n\n* The terms of the deal set out by the US between Ukraine and Russia are as follows:\n   * Official recognition of Crimea as Russian.\n   * No NATO membership for Ukraine, though EU membership is accepted.\n   * Freezing the conflict along current front lines, with some minor territory transfers (Ukraine getting some territory in Kharkiv, and Russia getting some territory in Donetsk), importantly, this would be a de facto recognition, not an official (de jure) one.\n   * Sanctions lifted on Russia.\n   * Some kind of economic cooperation agreement between Russia and the US.\n   * A \"robust\" security guarantee for Ukraine, provided by European nations, though the exact terms of this are vague. \n   * Unimpeded passage on the Dnipro river for Ukrainian ships.\n   * Compensation and assistance for rebuilding Ukraine, though the terms of this are also vague.\n   * The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be considered to be on Ukrainian territory, but will be operated by the US, with power supplied to Ukraine and Russia.\n* Overall, this deal is reasonably close to what I was expecting. You can look at comments I made over a year ago about the eventual resolution of the war where I sketched out something very similar to this. It favors Russia more than Ukraine, but the inclusion of EU membership, no demilitarization of Ukraine, and real security guarantees are all significant elements that don't leave Ukraine out to dry too much. \n* A lot depends on what exactly the security guarantees are. European peacekeeping contingents and a continued flow of arms to Ukraine are crucial to preserve any peace. I've seen some reports that this deal precludes any European peacekeeping forces, but I haven't seen direct confirmation of that. If it does, then it should be totally rejected. \n* It's important to remember that the chief Russian goals of the invasion were to eliminate Ukrainian sovereignty and \"de-militarize\" the country. Any deal that leaves Ukraine with control over its own government and preserves the strength of the Ukrainian military, is, in a way, a colossal loss for Russia, even though it may not feel that way, since Ukraine would still have to cede territory to Russia in response to an illegal invasion. For these reasons I also think it's unlikely that Russia will accept the deal, since accepting it would mean a tacit acknowledgement that they failed in their explicitly stated goals for the war.  \n* I also think it's unlikely Ukraine will accept the deal, since they have written into their constitution that they can't cede any territory to Russia. \n* This is a great example of the problem of justice vs. peace, similar in some ways to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Ukraine wants justice, while the US wants peace. You can certainly make the case that peace without justice is wrong. But if you look at how that policy has worked out for the Palestinians, you get the sense that at some point, sacrificing your people for the sake of land is also wrong. There aren't any good options here unfortunately, and in some ways, this kind of deal represents one of the least bad options. To keep fighting the war for another couple of years, Ukraine will certainly have to further lower their age of conscription. They already have a huge demographic problem and comparatively very few young people, so having to send those 18- and 19-year-olds to the front line would really hurt the country's prospects going forward. I do think it would be worth it to sacrifice Donetsk and Luhansk to save those young people, though that is obviously an extraordinarily bitter pill to swallow. \n* The bottom line for me is, when you are fighting against someone much stronger than you, you have to accept that survival is the most important victory. This deal, if it did include peacekeeping forces, would allow Ukraine to survive. I'd love to be in a world where Ukraine is able to take back the territory they've lost. But unfortunately, we haven't seen any indication that they are capable of that. And waiting on the Russian military to collapse is not a winning bet. Ask Napoleon or Hitler how that worked out for them. \n\n**Events this Week:** \n\n* In a grim continuation of a recent trend, Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike against Ukraine, including attacks that explicitly targeted civilians, which is a war crime. At least 9 people were killed, and many more wounded. This attack did prompt Trump to angrily post on social media \"Vladimir, STOP!\" He has publicly expressed his frustration with Putin more than once, and a part of me still holds out for the day when he may finally realize that trying to work with Putin is a fool's errand. But he and JD Vance also posted more false and incredibly stupid criticisms of Zelensky and said that if the proposed deal isn't agreed to soon, the US will fully step away from the conflict. \n* A massive explosion occurred at Russia's 51st GRAU arsenal close to Moscow. It's unclear if the explosion was because of a Ukrainian attack, sabotage, or simply a mistake. But the damage and fires are clearly visible on satellite imagery, so this was a very powerful explosion. Some sources have claimed that over 100,000 tons of ammunition were destroyed.\n* Putin announced a farce Easter truce last weekend that was immediately violated hundreds of times by his own forces. \n* Reuters reported this week that small groups of officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army have arrived in Ukraine behind Russian lines to observe conditions and gather information. These officers are not fighting in the war but are there to signal Chinese support for Russia and help the Chinese military learn lessons from the war. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,470 (+145)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,938 (+21)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,874 (+58)\n* Russian SPG losses: 918 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 320 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 139 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,678 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,156 (+5)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,326 (+11)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 886 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 529 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+1)\n\nLighter losses on both sides this week, though Russia losses are still fairly bad. Ukrainian ones are mostly back to normal.\n\nThanks for reading! ",

        "body": "# Why Ukraine would rather fight than give Crimea to Russia\n\nAs Trump pressurises Zelensky to recognise Moscow’s control over the peninsula, Kyiv fears this would set a dangerous precedent and further embolden Putin. *Marc Bennetts, Kyiv, Thursday April 24 2025, 12.35pm BST, The Times*\n\nFor President Trump, the solution to the war in Ukraine is extremely simple: Kyiv should recognise the realities on the ground and put aside its objections to the Kremlin’s land grabs. For many Ukrainians, though, Trump’s demands are not only unrealistic but a threat to the very existence of their country. As he pushes hard for a peace deal before his 100th day in office, Trump has taken a sledgehammer approach to diplomacy, threatening to walk away entirely from negotiations and attacking President Zelensky’s refusal to acknowledge Russian rule in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that was annexed in 2014.\n\n“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelensky’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. He said that Crimea had been “lost years ago” and that its status was “not even a point of discussion”.\n\nFor Kyiv, the recognition of Russia’s seizure of Crimea would set a “dangerous precedent” and only encourage President Putin’s appetite for Ukrainian lands, according to Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst who is seen as close to Zelensky’s administration. Although Trump’s peace proposal has not been published by the White House, a draft copy that was seen by Axios, an American media outlet, says that it would involve Washington formally recognising Russian control over Crimea and acknowledging its de facto rule in four regions in the east and south of Ukraine. Fesenko said: “If we have to choose between recognising Crimea as Russian and the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process, then Ukraine is more likely to be prepared for the US to pull out of the talks. For Ukraine, this is the lesser of two evils.\n\n“Of course, these are potential risks for Ukraine in this. But we must understand that the risk of recognising \\[Russian control of\\] Crimea is much greater and more long-term than the risk of the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process. Crimea is a very serious and very fundamental issue for us. If the Americans agree to this, then after some time Putin will almost inevitably demand recognition of the rest of the annexed territories.”\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump said that Zelensky was not being asked to recognise Crimea as Russian territory. However, he suggested that he expected some kind of commitment from Zelensky that Ukraine would no longer challenge the Kremlin’s rule over the peninsula, a stunningly beautiful region where Soviet leaders once took their holidays. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” Trump wrote. He also appeared to repeat one of Putin’s justifications for seizing Crimea, writing that it had been home to Russian submarine bases “for many years”.\n\nPutin has said that Russia was forced to seize Crimea to prevent Sevastopol, the home of its Black Sea fleet, from falling under Nato’s control after a pro-western government came to power in Kyiv in 2014.",

Trump’s abrupt reversal of the Biden administration’s support for Kyiv in favour of improving ties with Russia has already made him deeply unpopular in Ukraine. His efforts to pressure Zelensky on Crimea have now provoked open contempt.\n\nIllia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist, wrote on X: “This insane plan to blackmail and twist Ukraine’s arm — a scheme as foolish as it is detached from reality — will go down as one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of global diplomacy.” But not everyone is ready to write off Trump and his administration just yet. “Of course we are not going to give up on the United States, because the situation can change,” Merezhko said. “We need to work with Trump.

The past 11 years of the occupation [of Crimea] have shown that partial concessions do not lead to de-escalation. Russia does not interpret them as compromise but rather as weakness.”\n\nFesenko said, however, that Trump’s threats and pressure on Ukraine could be part of a “psychological attack” by the White House aimed at extracting massive concessions from Kyiv in the shortest possible time. “So we have to wait it out, and hold out until Trump’s mood changes,” he said.\nAlthough Zelensky has admitted that Ukraine is not at present strong enough to liberate Crimea and other Russian-occupied territories by force, he has said that Kyiv will strive to return them through diplomatic efforts. He has also said that Ukraine will discuss wider issues on how on resolve the war only after a full ceasefire has come into effect across the 600-mile front, a proposal that Moscow has not agreed to.\n\nCrimea has held strategic importance in Europe for millennia. At the time of the ancient Greeks it was a boundary between the classical world and the untamed steppe. The Crimean Khanate, a Tatar successor state of the Golden Horde, was the primary power in the region for hundreds of years until Catherine the Great’s Russian Empire won the territory in a war with the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century.\n\nRussia’s ambitions in the wider region met opposition from other big powers, including Britain, in an episode that culminated the in the Crimean War in the 1850s. During the Soviet period, Crimean Tatars were oppressed and deported to central Asia under Stalin, and Crimea was the setting of the Yalta talks that sought to reorder Europe after the Second World War. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the peninsula from the Russian Soviet Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1954. It is recognised as a part of Ukraine by a large majority of nations to this day.\nEven if Ukraine wanted to hand over Crimea to Russia, though, there would be significant legal obstacles. According to the Ukrainian constitution, Crimea is an inseparable part of Ukraine and the government has no legal right to sign it away without a two-thirds majority vote in parliament and the approval of the Ukrainian people in a referendum. Another complication is that neither referendums nor elections can be held under martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in 2022.\n\n“Ukraine will always act in accordance with its constitution,” Zelensky wrote, in an apparent response to Trump’s comments. He also posted on social media a “Crimea declaration” from 2018 by Mike Pompeo, then Trump’s secretary of state, which said Washington “rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea”. Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP who heads the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it was possible that Trump was putting forward “absurd” demands as a deliberate negotiating tactic and that he would lower them if Kyiv held firm. “This is the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic scenario is that [Trump] understands that Ukraine will never agree to recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea as legal and this is all a pretext to walk away from negotiations and to blame Ukraine instead of Russia.”\n\nAlthough the White House peace plan is reported to say that Ukraine would get “a robust security guarantee” from its allies in Europe and elsewhere, there were no details on how a peacekeeping operation would function and no mention of any direct involvement by the United States. It also ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. “We need security guarantees, because without them this is a just a delayed death for us,” Merezhko said. “We need a guarantee of our survival.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, Ukraine has been reluctant even to discuss the plan, under which sanctions of Russia would also be lifted. In return, aside from the vague security guarantees, Kyiv would get back a small part of land that Russia has occupied in the Kharkiv region, unimpeded passage of the Dnipro river — especially in the Kherson region, where Russian forces are on the riverbank — and promises of compensation and assistance to rebuild.",

This policy of non-recognition lasted for five decades and played a crucial role in enabling the Baltic states to maintain their diplomatic missions and financial assets during Soviet occupation. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the declaration's legacy helped the Baltic states re-establish their independence and gain international recognition.\n\n&gt;In the context of Crimea, the Welles Declaration serves as a historical precedent for the principle of non-recognition of territorial changes achieved through force. It underscores the importance of maintaining international norms and could influence negotiations regarding Crimea's status by highlighting the long-term impact of such policies on territorial disputes and sovereignty.\n\nIf you disregard the monumental stupidity of ceding territory for what constitutes to a pinky swear for russia to end their aggression on this condition alone, it really is a very dangerous precedent to set for any future territorial wars, global peace, the rules based order and international laws.\n\nAnd it is quite obvious to anyone who knows putins goals, has any understanding of russian ambitions and history, that this will only strengthen russia so they can restart a bigger war in a few years. This should not be allowed to be a short term vain political win for a geriatric reality-star who will die in a few years anyway.",

It's about ego more than money. It's about beating or crushing his opponent. And equally: he is a junkie. That would explain why he loses interest soon after a deal is made - mineral deal with Afghanistan for example - AND why he breaks deals to remake them bigger and 'better' - Canada Mexico for example. As soon as his high wears off, he needs another hit. It is never enough to satisfy. And the more dominant alpha/crushing that he can be - the better his fix but then he will always need an even bigger hit. \n\nMoney? It's not as important. If it were, he probably wouldn't have gone bankrupt as often as he has. And he wouldn't lose interest so quickly after a deal is made. He very often fails with any follow through that is required for making money from his deals - even when a lot of money could be made. The Afghanistan mineral deal is a great example of this. Very soon after striking that deal, he threw the Afghans under the bus - completely sidelined them and made a deal with the Taliban... and we all know what was the result of that.\n\nAnd of course that means he is the absolute worst type of person to make a deal with because he will never fill his cravings and he will always want to redo the deal in even more domineering ways (UA mineral deal for example - as soon as UA was on the verge of agreeing he massively upped his demands - he just wasn't getting enough of his drug). It seems to me that this is the perfect addiction for a narcissist. \n\nI imagine that not being able to make deals absolutely enrages him beyond any reason, too.  \n\nThat's my latest read on trump anyway for what it is worth.",

    "selftext": "There seems to be a notable pattern where major Ukrainian battlefield successes—such as the destruction of the large ammunition depot in Russia’s Vladimir region—are quickly followed by renewed pressure from Donald Trump and his team for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and an unfavorable peace deal.\n\n# Timeline and Coincidence\n\n* On April 22, 2025, a huge explosion destroyed one of Russia’s largest munitions depots near Moscow, causing a significant loss of ammunition and likely further straining Russia’s already stretched logistics[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html).\n* Almost immediately, U.S. officials, including Trump’s envoy, convened with Ukrainian and European representatives in London to push Trump’s “final offer” peace proposal, which would require Ukraine to accept U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian occupation in several other regions[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html)[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Nature of the Peace Proposal\n\n* The proposal is widely seen as highly favorable to Russia: it offers Russia tangible gains (recognition of annexed territories, a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, lifting of sanctions) while Ukraine receives only vague security promises and limited territorial returns[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[4](https://nypost.com/2025/04/23/world-news/heres-what-russia-and-ukraine-get-in-trumps-final-offer-peace-deal/)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n* The plan was drafted after Trump’s envoy met with Putin for several hours, fueling perceptions that the proposal is essentially written to satisfy Russian objectives[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Ukrainian Response and International Context\n\n* President Zelensky and Ukrainian officials have categorically rejected the proposal, as it would require Ukraine to accept the loss of sovereign territory and abandon its NATO ambitions, both of which are politically and constitutionally unacceptable in Ukraine[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt seems more than coincidental that every time Ukraine achieves a significant battlefield victory, such as the Vladimir ammunition depot explosion, there is a renewed and urgent push from Trump and his team for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and a deal that heavily favors Russian interests. This pattern supports the perception in Kyiv and among observers that the U.S. peace push is less about supporting Ukraine’s position and more about freezing the conflict before Ukraine can capitalize further on its military momentum[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html)[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Citations:\n\n1.

    "selftext": "Our (Danish) media has published a good article outlining the timeline of Trumps \"negotiations\" and how he's faltering. I just had to share it.\n\n[https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-04-22-trump-kan-vaere-ved-at-stemple-ud-mener-analytiker](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-04-22-trump-kan-vaere-ved-at-stemple-ud-mener-analytiker)\n\nTranslation via chatGPT:\n\n**Analyst: Trump May Be Tapping Out**\n\nOn Friday, the statement first came from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and shortly thereafter it was confirmed by President Trump: If Russia or Ukraine prove to be “difficult” and refuse to enter a peace agreement, the U.S. will soon withdraw from the peace negotiations and focus on other matters.\n\nAlthough Trump describes himself as the master of all negotiations and for months guaranteed peace within 24 hours of taking office, an agreement still seems illusory. Granted, the 24-hour peace guarantee was later changed to 100 days, but fundamentally, Trump’s envoys have not brought the parties any closer together.\n\nIn short, things have gone wrong because Trump overplayed his hand. He interpreted the situation as if he and Putin held all the strong cards. Back during the bizarre scene in the Oval Office, where the press conference with President Zelensky ended in an argument, Trump shouted, “You don’t have the cards.” That was a misreading. Ukraine *does* have cards, and Trump has managed to play his own hand weakly in front of Putin. That’s why things are falling apart.\n\n**No Aces Up the Sleeve in London**\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, the U.S., Ukraine, France, and the UK will meet in London, and nothing suggests that Trump has any aces up his sleeve. On the contrary, the latest reports from the *Wall Street Journal* indicate that the Trump team is being forced to propose an unrealistic plan.\n\nAccording to the newspaper’s sources, the Trump administration’s proposal now is that Ukraine should cede Crimea to Russia and give up any prospect of joining NATO. Furthermore, the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia should be placed under U.S. control.\n\nThe proposal does not mention what is to happen with the four partially occupied provinces—Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson—which Putin has had written into Russia’s constitution and thus lays claim to. Nor are there any security guarantees for Ukraine. In other words, Ukraine must make concessions but gets nothing tangible in return.\n\nEven the first demand—to give up Crimea—is completely unrealistic. Ukraine is a democracy, and it would require a constitutional amendment that is unlikely to gain support. If Zelensky were to accept this demand, it would likely be political suicide and would strengthen Ukrainian nationalism. It would be like asking a Danish prime minister to give up Bornholm.\n\nWith security guarantees and temporary status for parts of the occupied areas, there might be a chance.\n\n**Europe Is a Trump Card for Ukraine**\n\nSince the beginning of Trump’s so-called “peace negotiations,” the strategy has been to try to strong-arm Ukraine into submission. Trump wanted to force the party he believed held the weak hand at the table to surrender.\n\nHad Ukraine stood completely isolated, that strategy might have had a chance. But Ukraine is not isolated. Trump underestimated the support Ukraine has received from European countries as well as from Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Among NATO’s 32 members, only the U.S. and Hungary have chosen to follow Trump’s course.\n\nTrump has therefore underestimated Europe’s willingness to collectively back Ukraine. The many summits called at short notice in various European capitals with different country constellations in recent months have shown this support.\n\nThey all agree that only Ukraine itself can decide whether to give up territory and that any agreement would be unsustainable without robust security guarantees. The UK and France will almost certainly maintain that stance at the London meeting. Europeans know that conceding to Putin’s territorial demands will only lead to more demands and would be a ticking time bomb under Europe’s security.\n\n**Trump Has Strengthened Putin’s Hand**\n\nBecause of Trump’s misreading of the situation, he has, since taking power, handed many valuable cards to Putin. This includes issues such as territorial concessions, NATO membership, security guarantees, support for Russia in the UN, and fully adopting Russia’s narrative of the war. All of these trump cards have been given to Putin without Trump demanding anything in return.\n\nParallel to the peace negotiations over Ukraine, Trump has even initiated talks on normalizing relations between the U.S. and Russia—both diplomatically and economically, with Trump’s lead negotiator, Steve Witkoff, openly highlighting how lucrative the Trump administration sees opportunities in Russia.\n\nTherefore, Putin has had no incentive to make a single compromise on Ukraine. His war aim of gaining control over all of Ukraine remains intact. He knows that Trump is more focused on lucrative deals than on defending international law, Ukraine’s survival as an independent state, and Europe’s security.\n\n**War Is Much More Than a Card Game**\n\nIf we rewind to that scandalous evening in the Oval Office, Zelensky tried to interject, “This is not about playing cards.” Trump didn’t listen. But the war is indeed about much more than three parties at a card table, where the nearly 40 million Ukrainians are the weak party, supposedly forced to capitulate.\n\nTrump could, for instance, have listened when NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Cavoli, testified before Congress on April 3. There, the U.S. top general in Europe explained that Ukraine is actually holding up fairly well in the war. They have been under pressure but have resolved many of their military challenges. They are far from losing.\n\nMost recently, Secretary Rubio announced that he will not attend the Wednesday meeting in London. This suggests that Trump may be giving up on the effort and tapping out. Regardless of the realities, Ukraine will likely be blamed for the collapse.",

There isn't really any way to explain this strike other than as an act of terror. But that didn't stop Trump from trying to explain it away as a \"mistake,\" while denigrating Zelensky and blaming him once again for starting the war even though there is no truth to that claim whatsoever. He did that in the context of saying he wouldn't send Zelensky crucial Patriot batteries and missiles that Ukraine uses to defend their civilian population, even though Zelensky offered to pay billions of dollars for them. \n* The Trump administration, did, however, extend the sanctions package against Russia that was created by Biden. The State Department is also allegedly considering options to expand sanctions. This lines up with what we know about the factions within the Trump administration, where the envoy to Russia Steve Witkoff represents the pro-Russian faction, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg represent the pro-Ukraine faction. It feels like each faction gains and loses influence on a week to week basis, though it's also clear that Trump favors Witkoff more than Kellogg and Rubio, since he is constantly repeating false claims that come from Witkoff. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Witkoff is an absolute clown who is being repeatedly humiliated and played by the Russians. We'll know the Trump administration is serious about peace when Witkoff gets the boot. \n* It seems that after years of waffling, Germany may finally send Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. It will be too little too late even if they do get sent, but that's still a positive development. Germany also sent over a new batch of aid including new Howitzers, ammunition for artillery and Gepard anti-air vehicles, and a bunch of ground radars, presumably for detecting drones, among other equipment. \n* More information has come out about the scale of North Korean assistance to Russia. At this point, it's likely that a majority of the artillery shells they fire are North Korean. They've also received large numbers of guided missiles, multiple launch rocket systems, and other equipment. But the artillery ammunition in particular has been absolutely crucial for keeping Russia in the war. North Korea is rapidly converting more and more factories to produce ammunition. They have apparently profited at least $20 billion dollars from this assistance, on top of whatever technology transfers they have received, and the valuable experience their troops have gained from fighting. \n* Some progress has allegedly been made on the US-Ukraine minerals deal, with the US dropping some of our more insane demands and lowering the amount of money the deal is supposed to pay the US back from $300 billion to $100 billion. \n* Ukraine unveiled a new \"missile-drone\" called Bars that is a relatively cheap and easily producible cruise missile with a decent range of about 7 to 800km. This isn't going to be comparable to a top of the line cruise missile like the Storm Shadow, but it's not supposed to be. It will be a great tool for saturating Russian air defenses and creating space for better things like Storm Shadow to operate. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,325 (+197)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,917 (+32)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,816 (+79)\n* Russian SPG losses: 917 (+8)\n* Russian SAM losses: 319 (+6)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 139 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (-1)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,601 (+93)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,151 (+13)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,315 (-80, Oryx must have cleaned up their data a bit)\n* Ukrainian IMV (Infantry Mobility Vehicle) losses: 875 (+13)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 522 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 170 (+0)\n\nAnother week of devastatingly heavy losses for Russia. They've lost more than an entire brigade's worth of vehicles in the last two weeks alone. Ukraine is still taking higher losses than average, but nowhere near Russian levels. Based on the number of destroyed armored vehicles Russia has lost in the past two weeks, it doesn't seem like their offensive is going very well so far. \n\nThanks for reading!",

    "selftext": "Peace is out of reach for Ukraine due to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing aggression, European defense ministers stressed Friday, even as the United States pushed ahead with talks with Moscow.\n\nTop Trump administration official Steve Witkoff met Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, shaking hands with Putin at the start.\n\nPutin and Witkoff were set to discuss Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the meeting, which ended at 10 p.m. Moscow time (3 p.m. ET), according to Russian state media TASS.\n\nPeskov had referred to the assembly as “a good opportunity” to convey the Russian position to Trump. A possible Putin-Trump meeting may also be on the agenda, state news agency RIA Novosti cited Peskov as saying.\n\n“The painstaking work continues. Naturally, Witkoff, as a special representative of (US President Donald) Trump, will convey something from his president to Putin. Putin will listen to it. The conversation will continue on various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement,” Peskov said, state media TASS reported.\n\nWitkoff, who is Trump’s foreign envoy, also met Friday with Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev in St. Petersburg, according to RIA Novosti. Dmitriev later described those discussions as “productive” in a post on X on Friday.\n\n# ‘Russia is the sole cause of this war’\n\nThe US meetings in Russia come as Ukraine’s key allies gathered Friday in Brussels, where the defense ministers of the United Kingdom and Germany emphasized that Putin has continued his aggression against both military and civilian targets despite claiming to want peace.\n\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting was co-hosted by the UK and Germany, with a noticeable absence at the table: US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who only attended virtually.\n\nThe group of roughly 50 nations, which was created by former US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the Biden administration, meets regularly to discuss bolstering military support for Ukraine.\n\n“Given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a news conference immediately after the meeting, speaking alongside the Ukrainian and British ministers.\n\n“We will ensure that Ukraine continues to benefit from our joint military support. Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it,” added Pistorius.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made a virtual appearance, where he warned the past month had made it “completely clear” that “Russia is the sole cause of this war.”\n\nHe made explicit reference to Putin’s refusal to accept a US-proposed ceasefire in March. “Without strength against Russia, there will be no will in Russia to accept and implement any realistic and effective proposals for peace,” he said.\n\nBritish Defense Secretary John Healey also noted that “today is one month to the day in which Russia rejected President Trump’s peace settlement.”\n\n“Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. Putin said he wanted peace, but he continues to drag his feet and delay negotiations. Putin said he wanted peace, but his forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike,” Healey said.\n\nFriday’s meeting marks the first time a senior Pentagon official has not attended in person since the group was established in 2022 just months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which comes amid a series of policy shifts by the Trump administration seen as moving closer to Moscow.\n\nIt came as Trump’s envoy to Ukraine suggested Kyiv would have to cede its eastern territories to achieve a peace deal with Moscow, in remarks that would likely alarm Western allies and leaders in Kyiv.\n\nGeneral Keith Kellogg, a former national security adviser, said Ukraine could be divided “almost like Berlin after World War Two,” in an interview with British newspaper The Times, published Friday. British and French troops could engage zones of control in western Ukraine as part of a “reassurance force,” with Russian troops occupying the east, he added. Kyiv’s forces would line the space in between, alongside a demilitarized zone, he said.\n\nIn a post on X, Kellogg later said that he had been referring to potential “zones of responsibility for an allied force” rather than the partitioning of Ukraine, and emphasized that the idea did not foresee US troops on the ground.\n\nWitkoff, another senior Trump aide, has touted the view that Ukraine would need to give up the four regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – to see an end to the war, indicating a stunning policy departure from the previous administration.\n\n# ‘A matter of priorities’\n\nGermany’s Pistorius said ahead of the Brussels meeting it was the Trump administration’s decision to attend virtually and was “not his business” to comment on the signal that sends.\n\n“It’s not a matter of priorities. I think it’s a matter of schedules,” Pistorius added.\n\nAhead of the meeting, the British defense minister offered strong words of support for Ukraine and called for putting “even more pressure on Putin.”\n\n“Our commitment is to put Ukraine in the strongest position to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and deter future Russian aggression,” Healey said in a statement.\n\nNew pledges of military aid announced after Friday’s meeting total more than €21 billion euros ($23.8 billion), Healey announced, calling it “a record boost in military funding for Ukraine.”\n\nGermany will provide a further €11 billion ($12.5 billion) in military support to Ukraine through 2029, including IRIS-T mobile air defense missile systems and PATRIOT missiles, Ukraine’s defense minister said Friday from Brussels.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Norway will also jointly give an additional $589 million in military aid, to provide maintenance to vehicles, radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones.\n\nAir defense is Kyiv’s priority, Zelensky said ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe absence of US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, pictured at Thurday's cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, will mark the first time since the group’s founding three years ago that a senior Pentagon official will not. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\n“We just need to address the shortage of air defense systems to make our sky protection stronger,” Zelensky said. “Our partners can help with this and also speed up the implementation of all agreements reached earlier. Patriots that remain unused in storage with our partners should be protecting lives.”\n\nZelensky said earlier this week that Russia was “preparing” a new offensive, as CNN reported that Russia’s army has increased operations across the front line in recent weeks.\n\nUkraine’s military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told Ukrainian media on Thursday that Russia has “already begun” its new offensive against the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.\n\nMeanwhile, a new United Nations report revealed this week that Ukraine experienced a significant increase in civilian casualties from Russian attacks in March.\n\nThe number of civilian casualties was 50% higher than the previous month, with at least 164 people killed and 910 injured in March, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Friday’s meeting was the first without a US defense secretary present. It is the first that a senior Pentagon official has not attended in person.\n\nCNN’s Mariya Knight, Matthew Chance, Svitlana Vlasova, Clare Sebastian, Catherine Nicholls and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.",

    "selftext": "**Video of the Week:**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1jvzp2a/video/og29e9m0m0ue1/player\n\n* This video, which is likely from last year or earlier, shows extremely clear footage of a very low flying Russian jet drop bombs on a treeline position. You can also see a Ukrainian AD missile, likely from a Buk system, chase after the jet. We don't know if the missile hit or not.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nKursk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2won01mbm0ue1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc05bf323a6edb9c6a8c946c9ea79c80ac01cf4c\n\nKursk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/an3qnsmem0ue1.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196ff31cf871a68421c2e31b61a4e579443571ef\n\n* Ukrainian forces have been further pushed back, pretty much out of Kursk entirely. Russian forces here are now amassing for an offensive into Sumy. Ukrainian defenses here are said to be very strong, so I don't think they will achieve much, and it's probably good that the troops here aren't being transferred to the Donbas.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8b0uq8com0ue1.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d6d3b0c3596ac2634877aaf549bfd774b5ebc9\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5up37mpm0ue1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5beffc53bcae39420bd0293a74c53cee1f7ebc95\n\n* No changes here this week.\n\nLyman last week (re-named from Kreminna to correctly show the focus of the front here):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whbfy6nwm0ue1.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b071a5bc87328f8add4bdc77e945a39705686461\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gfkej1zm0ue1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b11c37ca5e818a0bfd8819327e6c75466ab366\n\n* Russian forces have been making threatening advances here as part of their push to re-take the town of Lyman, which they seized in 2022 and then lost in the Kharkiv counter-offensive. Lyman is a key logistics hub. Fortunately, this week, Russia has not made confirmed gains here, but the whole area is in danger.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ga6l5bg9n0ue1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c594de9d86ca95dfe8b6ed272be9b86d189f780\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjt1tnwan0ue1.png?width=879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5377442e4e790669e8562d9f3735e7588efb837\n\n* No changes here.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8yzfqden0ue1.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21dfab3c3a4f16c66f51777825bf8416f9320742\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vsks8mufn0ue1.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb19a5e199d4a4cfb3dbd6aaf4e0a7780457939c\n\n* Russia has re-taken a fair amount of territory within Toretsk, and also appears to have sent a spearhead out of the city relatively deep into Ukrainian lines. I am skeptical that such a long, thin advance can be maintained, but we'll see. This is certainly a reversal of fortune for Ukrainian forces within Toretsk, unfortunately. Ukraine does appear to have further pushed back Russian forces within the Pokrovsk salient, so it's not all bad here this week.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week (renamed from Velyka Novosilka to more accurately represent this front):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39b2zenun0ue1.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25415ac3e013484d957faa5843e0cdaccea64a82\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kficv5wn0ue1.png?width=1195&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ffd6360011ae0a9c1a038fbde82ae6567d7043\n\n* Russia slightly expanded the grey zone north of Velyka Novosilka, no changes besides that.\n\n**Events this Week:**\n\n* Zelensky claimed that up to 155 Chinese nationals have been fighting in Ukraine, and a few of them have been captured already. China has denied that any of its soldiers are fighting there. These troops are likely soldiers of fortune who are in Ukraine to make money, rather than officially representing any kind of Chinese policy to fight in Ukraine. Zelensky is likely highlighting these troops as a way to show how close Russia is with China and associate them together in Trump's mind.\n* Ukrainian forces claimed to have destroyed a Russian Tu-22 bomber in a drone attack. Russia doesn't have many Tu-22s and is unable to build more of them.\n* Ukrainian forces also claimed to have destroyed or damaged up to 4 Buk air defense systems in a series of attacks, one of the more successful strikes on Russian AD assets if true.\n* Another successful Ukrainian strike targeted the biggest fiber optic plant in Russia, wreaking extensive damage to it. Fiber optic drones have become a very important capability in this war, and so disrupting Russia's ability to build more fiber optic cables is really smart.\n* Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian Army Syrskyi claimed that the Russian spring offensive has already begun, with Sumy and Kharkiv being the primary axes of advance.\n* Reported oil and gas revenues from Russia have dropped by 17%, a big drop that will hamper Russia's ability to fund the war. Oil prices have also dropped greatly in the past week, which puts even more pressure on the Russian budget.\n* The Economist published a few interesting reports on Ukraine this week, including an article where Ukrainian officials claimed they are confident they will be able to hold off Russian advances for the foreseeable future due to the vast number of drones they are able to produce and use effectively. Another report claimed that with increased European assistance, which is due to be around 40 billion Euros in 2025, Ukraine is likely to produce as many as 5 million FPV drones and 3,000 cruise missiles, which are both massive numbers. This aligns with Europe's goal of turning Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine.\"\n* Ukrainian officials reported that it has become more difficult to shoot down certain types of Russian drones and ballistic missiles, as the Russians have made improvements to these systems to allow them to be more unpredictable, and thus harder to shoot down. Ukraine and its allies are working to update their own systems to be able to deal with this, but these processes always take time. It's a constant game of cat and mouse.\n* The wife of top Ukrainian intelligence officer Budanov, Marianna Budanova, was apparently poisoned by Russian spies in an assassination attempt almost two years ago and has had to receive emergency treatment in the US to save her life.\n* Norway announced a significant increase in aid to Ukraine for 2025, bringing their total planned amount for this year to almost $8 billion, a large amount of money for one country to give.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,128 (+228)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,885 (+56)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,737 (+72)\n* Russian SPG losses: 909 (+9)\n* Russian SAM losses: 313 (+3)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 138 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+4)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,508 (+187)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,138 (+20)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,395 (+27)\n* (NEW) Ukrainian Infantry Mobility Vehicles (IMV - a key category which includes Humvee variants and similar vehicles): 862\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 514 (+12)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 170 (+0)\n\nVery high losses on both sides this week, thought the Russians got it worse, with a devastating 56 tanks and 72 IFVs lost, two of the highest numbers in those categories we've seen so far. That represents the loss of most of a brigade's worth of armored vehicles in one week.\n\nThanks for reading!",

GPS is a receiver based system, the signal is always there, if you have a receiver capable of reading it then you have access to it. \n\nThere are mechanisms to do denial of service but thats mostly based on geo-fencing and regional restriction (which in this case they probably wpuldnt do as it would impact more than just Ukraine/Russian military), you cant disable access for specific customers or platforms that have been given access to the military frequency data (unless maybe they carved out a specific Ukrainian frequency lobe that they could activate or deactivate at will? Doubt it). You could maybe do it by changing or denying key distribution to those customers, but that only really denies access to the military dual-frequency system, the civilian signal is always present and available instead (and has the exact same functionality and accuracy as the military signal, its just easier to jam and spoof). Even then, usually on deployment the system utilizes an annual or weekly key system, afaik the annual key is more commonly used as the weekly key has certain potential security risks associated and thus is restricted only to essential users to prevent it from being accessed by unauthorized entities. Unless the key reset coincided with the timing of events, or they forced a change to the encryption and issued new keys to every customer but Ukraine, I cant see GPS limitation being a thing.\n\n\nRealistically, whatever restrictions on their use are in place would have been pre-loaded into the software in advance of delivery. As these systems are designed to be used in austere environments where signal capability isnt always present or available (even gps signals can be jammed) its not like theyd be able to backdoor into it remotely to turn off features and systems. Even with GPS disabled, HIMARS also makes use of on-board inertial navigation tech as a redundancy against gps jamming. Yes, its less accurate than gps, but losing gps doesnt disable HIMARS - it would be useless as a weapon system if it did.",

They are pretty thorough during sell-off inspections looking for network vulnerabilities, software backdoors, unauthorized remote access hardware, etc. as well as production defects.

No, he did so remotely.\n\nStarlink != GPS\n\n&gt;HIMARS don't work on civilian GPS, which can be jammed quite easily. They work on military GPS satellites which the US has control over.\n\nGPS and Starlink are two vwry different systems. Starlink is transmit/receive, GPS is receive only. Civilian gps and military gps are the same, they use the same satellites and the same data streams, \"military gps\" is just a set of two frequency ranges within it - yes HIMARS can and does work on the civilian frequency in the event that the military signal is unavailable.\n\n&gt;And how many others would be impacted by a regional outage directed to Kursk?\n\nEverything that uses gps, both civilian and military - not just HIMARS but drones, aviation, radio communication, weather monitoring systems, cell phones, etc. It would impact healthcare, emergency responders, It would impact both Ukraine and Russiaz who have been foumd to frequently use civilian gps receivers alongside their GLONASS receivers in Russian built hardware. Had a denial of service acrually been done, youd have heard about it - because a lot of things that we know continued functioning would not be.\n\n&gt;HIMARS are useful because they can strike so far and so precisely. If you take away the precision and the missile hits 30 meters away on a 30km distance (0.1% error), what is their use?\n\nErr, the m26 rocket with 30km range used by HIMARS only has inertial navigation, there is no gps guidance system on those. Same with the M39 block I ATACMS that Ukraine has received. All other HIMARS missiles technically are inertial guidance with gps assistance - ie the inertial guidance system is the primary guidance system, the gps system is used for error correction. \n\nIn other words, if you are striking a target on the front line from 50km, the error wouldnt be 0.1% of 50km, it would be 0.1% of the point at which the gps signal was lost. Using military gps frequencies this might be 3-5km out from the target before the signal was jammed. In a hypothetical service denial scenario where only civilian gps is available it would be more like 8-10km. If youre doing a deep strike mission, say striking 200km into Russia from 50km behind the front, the situation would change again - while you might lose civilian gps within 10km of the front, once the missile was 10km behind the front it wpuld be able to re-acquire the civilian gps signal  (if not also military) to error correct back on course. The signal might drop in and out depending on whether it passed other jammers in-flight (other sensitive sites or military firmations), and may be further jammed as it approached its target in the terminal phase (assuming the Russians invested into EW defenses for said target). Point is though, its not 0.1% error of the full range of the missile, its 0.1% error of the distance to the target from the point that gps signal is lost.\n\nAnd that 0.1% number is wrong, INS used by HIMARS missiles has an error of 2-12 MILS (depending on the missile) which is less than 0.012%.",

        "body": "&gt;Yes, but I was addressing your statement. You said \"USA can't disable HIMARS GPS without physical access\", which is false. Very, very, false. In fact, that's exactly what they did.\n\nExcept they didnt. There is no source that reported GPS service outage. Geofencing before the weapons were donated and delivered is not the same as disabling, and is also atypical for weapons sales, this is a rare instance of it due to the Biden admins concerms of escalation, had these weapons been purchased by Ukraine during peacetime they would not have been a factor.\n\nIm also really not sure why you think starlink has anything to do with this - it doesnt. Starlink is not a gps system, and has nothing to do with the operation or usage of HIMARS aside from incidental usage as a means of communication of targeting data, something which can be done with other systems. Nor is it a US govt system (and in fact it was the US govt that got Elon to lift some of the starlink restrictions on Ukraine in the first place). Claiming HIMARS has a kill switch in its gps system because elon musk remotely geofenced starlink systems is like saying that your internet provider has a kill switch on your computer because your satellite tv provider canceled your television contract. None of those things have anything to do with eachother.\n\n&gt;Yes, but can the USA stop military GPS for entire regions, and that's what they fucking did. \n\nNo, they didnt.\n\n&gt;Military GPS is unjammable\n\nThats not even remotely true - and im telling you this with *professional knowledge* on that exact topic.\n\n&gt; but was disabled. Civilian GPS is jammable and it was jammed by the Russians. The USA have effectively toggled off HIMARS.\n\nNope\n\n&gt;Russians are shit at everything, but there's one thing they're good at: jamming radio frequencies. Yes, Russians have been jamming radio frequencies in the region. And yes, Russians jam radio frequencies in Ukraine to prevent first-aiders from saving Ukrainian lives.\n\nThis is a complete non-sequitur\n\n&gt;Man, I don't have the time to argue to your nonsense.\n\nYoure the only one arguing nonsense, painfully so. Its very clear that you have no firathand expertise on the topic at hand.\n\n&gt;Reality is: \n\n&gt;1. USA have disabled HIMARS\n2. have disabled F16s\n\nReality is that none of this is true. HIMARS strikes were reported during the period in which the Trump admin cut support. You literally have no idea what youre talking about. The US ceasing the delivery of intelligence and targeting data to Ukraine doesnt render HIMARS unusable, it just makes it harder for Ukraine to employ it effectively - they had to rely on their own targeting systems such as their one ICEYE satellite which can provide targeting information for fixed targets but not the real time data that Ukraine needs to strike troop concentrations. For that, Ukraine could get targeting data from its own drones but that limits the field of view and area that Ukraine could effectively strike. Ukraine is receiving additional ICEYE data from Finland and Germany as well, which provides periods of availability for more timely targeting data in certain areas by leveraging a larger constellation.\n\nThats a fundamentally Ukrainian problem, most NATO and European allies have a robust enough independent ISR capability to contonue using HIMARS without disruption.\n\nEven Ukrainian officials confirmed this, Valeriy Kondratiuk (former head of HUR) stated \"This mostly concerns the exchange of imagery. This isn’t critical because European companies have their own satellites, but not all these are focused on military dislocation and movements, which is important.\"\n\nF-16s were never disabled. You seem to be reading headlines or reddit thread titles and not ever actually reading the actual info underlying them. Trump killed continuing service support fkr F16 radar and ew systems - they still function, but lockheed martin wont repair them if they get damaged, troubleshoot them if they malfunction, nor provide updated frequency profiles to handle emerging threats or optimize against existing threats based on field performance. That makes F-16s less capable *over time* and exposes them to more risk, but doesnt ground the fleet. Mpre importantly though, many of the F-16s Ukraine has received are equipped with non-Ameeican radar and/or EW systems, and even for the American-built ones, many of Ukraines European allied have the independent ability to maintain, repair, update, and upgrade them despite the US cutting support for it, and several have already stepped in to fill the void.\n\n&gt;3. have stopped sharing satellite intelligence with the Ukrainians.\n\n\nFinally an accurate statement.\n\n&gt;Most importantly, most of European defense depends on US satellites. Let me state it again: European defense depends on US satellites. US just showed the world they can disable them and THEY WILL disable them whenever they want TO FORCE ALLIES INTO SUBMISSION (Ukraine is allied with the USA)\n\nNot accurate, unless European defense is trying to fight a war in asia or south america, etc. Individually and especially collectively the major european states have their own domestic targeting capabilities, theyre just *limited* by not having large constellations providing global coverage. They have what they need to defend their own territories and fight a war on their borders but not nevessarily to operate overseas. If Ukraine had developed the same capability as France, the UK, or Germany it would be a complete non-issue.\n\n&gt;Yes, those are all kill switches, de-facto.\n\n🤦‍♂️🙄",

Trump hates Trudeau, irrationally. \n\nAs for Ukraine, Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize (because President Obama had gotten one) and has this “brilliant” plan to stop the war in Ukraine by forcing Ukrainians to surrender. When Zelenskyy rejected Trumps stupid plan, Trump had a hissy fit and has withdrawn all military and intelligence aid, wrongly thinking that Ukraine will have to surrender if the USA no longer supports them.\n\nBut what Trumps toddler tantrum has actually done is prolong the war in Ukraine, weaken all the diplomatic relations with America’s (former) European allies, and show the Chinese that the USA is weak and has no resolve or willingness to stand up against aggressor nations. \n\nAnd that is the kind of diplomatic chaos that has just green-lit a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.",

    "selftext": "The events of the last week have left me shocked, angry, and beyond disgusted with the Trump Administration and my fellow Americans who voted for him. This week's update is the most difficult one I've had to write so far. Part me doesn't even want to write it, but I said I'd keep doing these until the war is over, and I stand by that. If Ukraine can keep fighting, I can keep writing.\n\n**Video of the Week**:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1j4z1t5/video/d4xb92e933ne1/player\n\n* This video depicts a HIMARS cluster munition strike on a grouping of Russian troops. Trump's decision to cut off aid to Ukraine and deny them access to intelligence means soon they will not be able to make strikes like this, limiting their ability to respond to large groupings of Russian forces.\n\n**Analysis of Trump's Actions:**\n\n* From the video I watched and analysis I've seen of the horrific Oval Office meeting that happened last week, it seems pretty clear that the meeting was going fine until JD Vance saw an opportunity to jump in and blow everything up because he supports right wing authoritarianism and wants Putin to win the war. They give cover to their pro-Russian sentiment by claiming they are doing it to try and separate Russia from China, but frankly that is a complete load of horse shit and anyone who believes that is severely lacking in intelligence. I think JD Vance is actually worse than that, I think he's actively an evil dude who knows exactly what he is doing, whereas Trump is really just an incredibly stupid person.\n* While maybe you can say Zelensky should have been a bit more conciliatory, this was pretty clearly a planned ambush, and there's only so much debasement you can ask Zelensky to do. He stands up for his country. He has reacted pretty well to this stuff all things considered, and his statements post-meeting have all been clearly aimed at placating Trump while not giving up his negotiating position.\n* Trump, meanwhile, has used this as an excuse to halt all aid shipments to Ukraine, and cut off Ukraine from American intelligence. He is killing Ukrainian soldiers and civilians for no reason at all. While this won't have an immediate effect, if this policy is sustained for several months, it may cause severe problems at the front line. Even more perverse is that one of the most important parts of US aid are Patriot interceptor missiles used to defend Ukrainian cities. Those missiles are not used offensively, there is no reason to withhold them except for pure malice. Donald Trump is directly helping Putin murder Ukrainian civilians in the name of \"peace\".\n* I have never been more ashamed of my country in my adult life. The idea that the pressure to end the war needs to be placed on Ukraine rather than Russia is so perverse that it's still difficult for me to wrap my head around the fact that this is apparently now US policy. I didn't think it would be possible for me to be any madder at Republicans than I already am, but here we are. Ronald Reagan must be rolling in his grave. Many GOP senators claim they stand for Ukraine while they do absolutely nothing to stop any of this madness. \"Little\" Marco Rubio used to be one of the staunchest backers of Ukraine in Congress, and now he is a lackey for the administration while they work to destroy everything he claimed to care about. I watched an interview with him and George Stephanopoulos where George pressed him on how this helps the US, and he threw a hissy fit while parroting Trump's garbage. It's pretty clear that he is actually mad at himself and at Trump, but he's too scared of Trump to do anything I guess.\n* Ukraine had indicated that they are still willing to sign the mineral deal, but Treasury Secretary Bessent now says that the deal is off the table for now, because Trump thinks he can get more. Absolutely appalling extortion of Ukraine's national wealth.\n* US polls from Reuters meanwhile show that 70% of Americans disagree with Trump's rhetoric on Ukraine, including 62% of Republicans. Trump might be willing to abandon Ukraine and suck up to Putin, but most Americans don't want that.\n* The past few days have seen a slight improvement, with some Trump administration officials claiming this won't last long, and leaders in Europe working hard to support Ukraine and push back on Trump to try and reset the relationship. But the problem is that even Trump's own officials have little to no power to do anything, everyone is scared of him, and no one really knows what he wants or what he's going to do next. This is horrendous leadership that makes everything more difficult.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nKursk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6372udr773ne1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb2339f3fbda246e299e0d9f63905e1bce4a1cb1\n\nKursk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghyzse7973ne1.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a04e6a3caccfef1b2de09a7081bce2b25766de6\n\n* Russia managed to push back a Ukrainian salient in the north of this sector.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7vqzc6f73ne1.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7c6bd27eb280f8bf7a313205ad3bb8d90b69aeb\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc414lng73ne1.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0aa3214caafdab60b3ec2b772737ffed01acf04c\n\n* No changes here.\n\nKreminna last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tpv6xbj73ne1.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c0ba8cf78e97d4006d6322bd53c7b08d4027d90\n\nKreminna this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2eq3syk73ne1.png?width=595&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55b94c4aa6acbff8c8e843452381136c358e2115\n\n* Russia advanced here to the northeast of Drobysheve.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qg8jtmeq73ne1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da2dec6f8a596146a26c28e6fb4cc44844185b34\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5u79tubs73ne1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38a12c0aaa0c2950e6c86e2826ae0900d8b0ed50\n\n* No changes.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzk4bxov73ne1.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c60d68a9998b93975aec9fd50c851704013feff\n\nPokrvosk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpkteo2x73ne1.png?width=991&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9a324b3ff1c54442fbca7cce984cd662154cdd\n\n* Ukraine seems to have successfully counter-attacked here both at the salient southwest of Pokrvosk and south of Toretsk.

European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyn announced the creation of a massive new fund to support European re-armament, worth $800 billion dollars or more, including $150 billion in direct loans to support military production.\n* Germany has gone even further, with major parties agreeing to push a bill through the lame duck parliament that will change borrowing rules to allow them to take out more debt and create a $500 billion dollar fund for infrastructure and defense spending. This dwarfs the $100 billion dollar special fund Germany created immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine, and will allow Germany to significantly re-vamp its military while sending even more aid to Ukraine.\n* France, Germany, and the UK are also creating a plan to use the $200 billion dollars in frozen Russian reserves to backstop a ceasefire deal, saying they will seize the money if Russia violates any ceasefire.\n* Norway is looking at ways to use its largest in the world $1.7 trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund to provide more aid to Ukraine.\n* There are also some indications that Starmer and Macron may go to the White House with Zelensky to negotiate with Trump, though their offices have said they don't plan to do that at the moment, so it's unclear if this will happen. But it should.\n* France and the UK have also agreed to keep providing intelligence to Ukraine to fill the holes left by the US. While they don't have as robust an intelligence collection operation as the US does, they still have a fairly capable spy satellite network that should be of great use to the Ukrainians.\n* Ukraine is also in a much better position to deal with these challenges than they were in the past. Most weapons used by Ukraine at this point are built in Ukraine, especially drones where they are now a world leader. They have made huge strides in domestic production of artillery ammunition as well. The main issues posed by the halting of US aid will come in the aforementioned Patriot interceptors, as well as GMLRS missiles for HIMARS (which are only produced in the US), and spare parts for Bradleys and Abrams. One thing I haven't seen discussed much is that Biden helped Ukraine make direct contracts with US defense companies for the provision of different types of equipment. It is unclear to me if Trump's decision impacts those contracts, but my suspicion is that it does not, since those were contracts paid for by Ukraine, and so don't constitute US aid. I don't know specifically what types of equipment and in what quantities those contracts were for, however.\n* A Russian Iskander missile strike targeted a Ukrainian training ground this week, killing dozens of soldiers and injuring many more. Why such a large grouping of troops were out in the open is a difficult question to answer, and the leadership of the unit which was hit (I believe it was the 157th Brigade) should be made to face consequences for their poor decisions.\n* The European Parliament is apparently planning some way to deprive Hungary of its voting rights, which would immediately make Europe far more able to push back against Russia. Obligatory fuck you to Victor Orban, Putin's puppet in Europe.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 20,577 (+26)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,786 (+3)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,554 (+9)\n* Russian SPG losses: 893 (+2)\n* Russian SAM losses: 302 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 136 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 151 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 7,965 (+28)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,092 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,228 (+2)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 474 (+1)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 168 (+1)\n\nVery light losses on both sides this week, especially for the Russians. This lines up with other indications we've seen that the Russians are either pausing their offensive or are simply unable to make as many offensive operations.\n\nShame on Trump and his whole administration, and shame on anyone who voted for him.

If Trump really wants peace he has to offer that to the Russians who will almost certainly refuse.\n\nTrump then has to either admit he just wants a Ukrainian surrender kissing goodbye to his Peace Prize and causing real problems for him at home or he has to force the Russian hand to agree to talks, ball is in Donald's court and it appears Zelenskyy has played him.",

    "selftext": "\nYour Excellency, Mr. President,\n\nWe watched your conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky with fear and distaste. It is insulting that you expect Ukraine to show gratitude for U.S. material aid in its fight against Russia. Gratitude is owed to the heroic Ukrainian\nsoldiers who have been shedding their blood for over 11 years to defend the free world's values and their homeland, attacked by Putin's Russia,\n\n\nHow can the leader of a country symbolizing the free world fail to recognize this?\n\nThe Oval Office atmosphere during this conversation\nreminded us of interrogations by the Security Services and Communist court debates. Back then, prosecutors and judges, acting on behalf of the communist political police, told us they held all the power while we had none. They demanded we stop our activities, arguing that innocent people suffered\nbecause of us. They stripped us of our freedoms for refusing to cooperate or express gratitude for our oppression. We are shocked that President Zelensky was treated similarly.\n\n\nHistory shows that when the U.S. distanced itself from democratic values and its European allies, it ultimately endangered itself. President Wilson understood this in 1917 when the U.S. joined World War I. President Roosevelt knew it after Pearl Harbor in 1941, realizing that defending America\nmeant fighting in both the Pacific and Europe alongside nations attacked by the Third Reich.\n\n\nWithout President Reagan and U.S. financial support, the Soviet empire's collapse would not have been possible, Reagan recognized the suffering of millions in Soviet russia and its conquered nations, including thousands of political prisoners. His greatness lay in his unwavering stance, calling the USSR an \"Empire of Evil\" and confronting it decisively. We won, and today, his statue stands in Warsaw, facing the U.S. Embassy. Mr. President, military and financial aid cannot be equated with the blood shed for Ukraine's independence and the freedom of Europe and the world. Human life is priceless. Gratitude is due to those who sacrifice their blood and freedom-something self-evident to us, former political prisoners of the communist regime under Soviet russia. We urge the U.S. to uphold the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which established a direct obligation to defend Ukraine's borders in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons. These guarantees are unconditional--nowhere do they suggest such aid is a mere economic transaction. \n\nSigned, Lech Wałęsa, former political prisoner, President of Poland \n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/lech-walesa-trump-letter.html\n",

Accountability has to lead to a learned lesson, otherwise it's just punishment with no end.\n\nI hope nasty makes it. I hope he takes several invaders to hell too! I also hope he recognizes that he isn't off the hook until he can fundamentally change who he is though, because one instance of being upset with a president doesn't imply that this man won't continue to support dictatorships (knowingly or not) and we need to see that kind of change to know he's accepted the *gravity* of the choice.\n\nIt's confusing and conflicting to hope he's ok and hope he's kicking ass out there while still wanting him to feel more directly responsible for what's going on and I get that.

He contradicts and confuses. If you agree with some of his policies and hear two things about him: he thinks Biden needs to give more weapons sooner (he said this) and he is pro Russia (he demonstrates this but says otherwise) you have to believe something and it makes sense to believe the more favorable situation (as someone who supports trump for other reasons, in this scenario). \n\nHonestly, in sort of sick of this bullshit.

This is just the reality.\n\nThe demographics of people who support Ukraine by fighting or support it in terms of advocacy and donations are extremely different. I don't expect everyone to understand the other side. However, the soldiers fighting who were once Trump supporters and no longer are have extremely powerful and important voices on this topic. Think about the courage it takes for them to come forward and say they were wrong before yelling at them.\n\n  \nReasons a lot of them supported Trump at some point (based on years of interacting with them). I'm not saying I personally support these views but this is common reasoning.\n\n1. Strong views about nationalism and want strong borders in their own countries.\n\n2. Covid lockdowns were an assault on individual liberties.\n\n3. Trump is funny and relatable. Democrats are not.\n\n4. Woke language is out of control and democrats are controlling their speech. \n\n  \nLook at the overlap here between these thoughts and someone willing to fight for freedom for Ukraine. This isn't cognitive dissonance and this isn't stupidity. This is a consistent core set of values of liberty at all costs. A lot of people are not going to agree with them but understanding how people got to this set of viewpoints is important.",

Trump personifies everything I raise my boys not to become.\n\nPivoting back to Ukraine and her brave defenders (native and foreign). I don’t believe all the dire predictions about Ukraine having no prospects for victory. Vance and Trump are simply parroting Putin. The truth is that Russia is no closer to winning than Ukraine is to losing. Russia is hoping for a lucky break and soon too. If Ukraine holds the course, yes they will likely lose some more territory, but sooner or later Putin’s house of cards will collapse.",

Today I actually opened some eyes. They stated they wouldn’t vote for PVV again or any putin-friendly party. One vote at a time…",

I'm not aware of claims of US election interference in Ukraine, nor did their politicians seem particularly pro western, compared to any other former soviet union eastern block country. \n\nIf you're still mad about Yakunovich he was accused of being responsible for killing protestors in a democratic country. That tends to not go over well. Those protestors were because he went back on election promises to work towards closer EU integration. \n\nThe US has very little interest in Ukraine, Nato already has Russia by the balls, Nato controls the black sea and baltic sea access. Which is like 90% of Russian population industry is going through those ports. \n\nRussia's issue is that they'd rather be king of shit mountain, than just one of the big fish in the ocean. \n\nModern progress is on the back of information technology. This has a high production cost, but low distribution cost. This means modern economic power and benefits come from mutually beneficial coordination, rather than 0 sum. That is, if the US invents windows, and Canada invents Shopify, we both get access to Windows and Shopify. Instead of each of us developing alternate versions independently of all these technologies/products/resources. \n\nWhereas historically a gold mine/oil well primarily only benefits the person that controls the oil well. \n\nRussia seems to believe the best way to be richer is to have more land, but it's already the largest country on earth.",

In the interview with NOS he dodged every question about him talking to Trump about the incident.\n\nhttps://nos.nl/collectie/13985/artikel/2557791-navo-baas-rutte-zelensky-moet-relatie-met-trump-herstellen\n\nTranslation:\n\nUkrainian President Zelensky must ensure that the relationship with the American president is restored quickly. That says NATO boss Rutte after the hard clash yesterday between Zelensky and Trump in the White House.\n\nRutte calls the confrontation in the Oval Office 'unfortunate': \"I don't think Trump was looking for a fight.\" According to Rutte, Zelensky and Trump first had a good conversation for half an hour. Then, according to Rutte, it was \"misforte wrong\", after which they fly \"full of each other in the hair\".\n\nThe NATO chief said he had contact with the Ukrainian president: “What I have told Zelensky is that we should respect what Trump has done so far.” Rutte says Zelensky must now find \"a way to restore the relationship with Trump\".\n\nRutte says he is convinced that Trump would also like a \"lasting peace\" in Ukraine. “What is needed is that we all work together: Europe, Ukraine and the United States.”\n“US remains committed to NATO”\n\nRutte also emphasized that the United States is the leader in NATO. The NATO chief said Thursday that he had called Trump for another half an hour and he is convinced that the US president is committed to the military alliance. According to Rutte, the US is \"totally\" committed to NATO, \"also as regards Article 5\". That article stipulates that an attack on one of the NATO countries is seen as an attack on all allies.\n\nRutte also underlined that in 2019 it was Trump who sent Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine, which then helped Ukraine three years ago stop the Russians in the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky and Trump came together yesterday to make a deal on Ukrainian raw materials, but that did not happen. During the meeting and in front of journalists, a quarrel between Zelensky and Trump and Vice President Vance came to a quarrel.\n\nZelensky called the incident afterwards in an interview with Fox News \"not good\", but refused to apologize. On X, he repeated today that he is \"very grateful\" for all American support. Trump said he was no longer interested in a commodity deal and says Zelensky has overplayed his hand. According to Trump, Zelensky is only welcome back to the White House \"when he is ready for peace\".\n\nTomorrow European Summit in London\n\nTomorrow, European leaders will meet in London led by British Prime Minister Starmer. Zelensky is also present. According to Rutte, it is important that the countries agree on security guarantees when it comes to an agreement with Russia.\n\n“We do not want war forever, but a lasting peace. In addition, it is important that Putin or his successor never dares to lift a finger in an agreement.\"",

While I don't think there is no choice, without USA Ukraine can't do anything else than heroically defend while being slowly pushed out. \n\nWhile production some smaller systems like MANPADS or ATGMs etc is ongoing and can be delivered to Ukraine, Europe has no stockpiles of the weapons that will let Ukrainians stop offensive and counterattack with successful breakthroughs - Tanks, IFVs, Breaching vehicles, ARVs. Without those they will be on constant defensive.\n\nEurope dropped the ball. There are only 2 NATO countries in Europe that make new tanks(hopefully soon K2 or Abrams will be produced in Poland): Turkey and Germany(with Greece, because hulls are made there). Italy has no manufacturing plant, UK built apartments in place where Challengers were built, France has no capability to build Leclercs. MGCS was a great chance to restart production, but Germany is sabotaging and delaying it, to not get a rival for Leopard. So France currently is without a capability to produce tanks and MGCS was delayed to 2040(and I already heard some voices about 2050). Not to mention that MGCS technical requirements are just absurd, much better protected tank with bigger canon but sub 50 ton. It's just not realistic. There is also upcoming KF51, but it doesn't exist in reality(it's turret technology demonstrator on hull of Leopard 2A4, to which Rheinmetall obviously doesn't have rights).\n\nPersonally I expected Europe to wake up and start with rearmament, but look at the orders for Leopards, everyone orders like 1 or 2(rare) battalions of tanks. It's a joke, same with the price of Leopard itself. Austrian gov approved procurement of 58 vehicles, with unit price of Leo 2A8 being 28 million euro. When you compare it to our(Poland) procurement it's unfunny joke. M1A2SEPv3 unit price is ~15.6m EUR and K2 unit price is ~18m EUR. Not to even talk about delivery time for Leopards vs K2s and M1s. I bet Leopard salesmen wear black nylon gloves and call it craft tank to justify the slow production and absurd price.\n\nThere is a reason why EU told USA that we can buy weapons for Ukraine from USA if they approve it, because there is nothing in EU stockpiles or production power to sustain Ukraine.",

        "body": "Political Advocacy for Ukraine: What Doesn’t Work and What Methods Work\n\n📢 Political Advocacy for Ukraine: What Doesn’t Work and What Methods Work\n\n📅 This post is especially important on the three-year anniversary of the full-scale war.\nUkrainians in America have the opportunity to influence support for Ukraine, but the effectiveness of any action is determined by its real impact, not the number of attempts.\n\n❌ Why don’t traditional advocacy methods work?\nPublic initiatives focused on attracting political support through calls and rallies are the most common advocacy tool. However, they remain ineffective, as confirmed by both empirical research and the current political situation.\n\n📞 Mass calls to Congress. Why doesn’t it work?\n\nInformation overload. Congressmen’s offices receive thousands of calls every day on various topics. In an environment of information noise, no call has a significant impact if it is not supported by institutional weight (lobbyists, donors, corporate executives).\nLack of political risk. Most politicians do not change their positions under the pressure of phone calls, because their political future depends not on this, but on donor contributions, media support and influential groups.\n\n🚶‍♂️ Rallies and physical presence in Washington\n🔹 Example: experience of a rally in San Francisco (February 23, 2025)\nThe Ukrainian diaspora organized a rally in support of military aid. Attendance - about 1,000 people.\n📉 Result: less than 10 mentions in the media, all in local publications, no coverage in national media.\n\n🔹 Example: American Coalition for Ukraine\nThis group gathers 500 participants twice a year and takes them to Congressional and Senate offices.\n📉 Result: none of the critically important bills were passed thanks to this activity.\n\n📌 Why?\n\nMost congressmen perceive such visits as a formality, not real pressure.\nThe lack of financial or strategic influence on the part of the participants leads to the fact that after the meeting they simply forget about it.\n\n📊 Princeton University study (2014): Why public opinion does not work?\n\nThe study “Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens” (Martin Gilens, Benjamin Page, 2014) analyzed 1,779 political initiatives in the United States from 1981 to 2002 and concluded that:\n\n📌 Public support for a bill does not affect the likelihood of its adoption.\n\nIf support is 0%, the chance of adoption is 30%.\nIf support is 100%, the chance of adoption is the same 30%.\n📌 Only economic elites and organized business groups have real influence.\n\nThe higher the level of support for a bill among economic elites, the higher the likelihood of its adoption.\nThe influence of business groups is much stronger than the influence of public initiatives.\n📌 Mass interest groups (public movements) have an impact only when their interests coincide with the interests of the elites.\n\nConclusion: 💡 If you want US policy towards Ukraine to change, you need to work with those who actually make decisions - business elites, influential media, political donors.\n\n✅ What really works?\n\n1️⃣ Lobbying through corporations\n🔹 Key companies:\n\nMicrosoft, Google, Boeing, General Electric - corporations that already support Ukraine, but can do more.\nThe National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) of the United States has a partnership with Ukraine and is interested in market stability.\n\n📌 What to do?\n\nLaunch internal initiatives in companies to advocate for support for Ukraine.\nInvolve top managers in shaping the company’s public position on sanctions against the Russian Federation and military aid to Ukraine.\nWork through business associations that influence policy through their lobbyists.\n\n2️⃣ Use influential media\n\n🔹 Key publications:\n\nThe New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Financial Times, The Economist.\n📌 What to do?\n\nContact journalists from these publications, offering insights or analytics.\nPublish columns and studies that explain Ukraine’s strategic role.\nInteract with opinion leaders on Twitter/X who influence the agenda.\n\n3️⃣ Pressure through key political players\n\n🔹 Who makes the decisions?\n\nSenator Ben Cardin (Chair of the Helsinki Commission).\nSenator Jim Risch (Member of the Foreign Relations Committee).\nCongresswoman Marcy Kaptur (Chair of the Ukrainian Caucus in the Congress).\n\n📌 What to do?\n\n- Attract American donors who support these politicians.\n- Interact with their advisors and committees working on foreign policy.\n- Promote advocacy messages through influential people who have direct contact with these politicians.",

Ukraine gives every single concession, PRE negotiations, and Russia concedes nothing, then Ukraine comes to the table and has to concede even more… with no guarantees that the ceasefire will last…. So we can have another invasion based circumstances that Russia can easily manufacture themselves?\n\nI understand completely as an American tax payer, that USA can’t just endlessly finance Ukraine….  But want to put something in perspective, USA have 180 billion, not 350 and most was in overvalued old weapons, and a lot of the budget got ate up by the USA lobbying system which gave logistics and maintenance contracts that Ukraine pointed out could have easily sponsored themselves and saved billions from the budget.but okay let’s go back and put a little financial perspective, the amount of money printed from 2019-2021 all the aid given to Ukraine let’s go with trumps number and let’s just say it was pallets of cash, all that money doesn’t even touch 5% of the money printed from 2019-2021…\n\nTrump wants to ensure profit on their “investment” but one thing he can’t see, is this is playing right into Putin hand who preaches a multi polar new world order weekly for the past decade. USAs 36 trillion debt hasn’t collapsed because USA maintains homogeny. It maintains this homogeny through strong geopolitical influence, ability to dictate policy world wide, the petro dollar world currency,and our strategic partnerships and alliances This comes with being the world police.

        "body": "Actually… Like many such quotations of Churchill, that is a misquote, one of those urban legends that gets passed down history. There is no evidence that he said this to Neville Chamberlain. \n\nThere are two occasions where he did say something remarkably similar, neither of which to Chamberlain himself, but both surrounding the Munich Conference and Chamberlain’s role in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia.\n\nAs the crisis in the Sudetenland brewed, Churchill wrote to David Lloyd George on 13 August 1938:\n\n‘I think we shall have to choose in the next few weeks between war and shame, and I have very little doubt what the decision will be.’\n\nThe second was to Lord Moyne on 11 September:\n\n‘We seem to be very near the bleak choice between War and Shame. My feeling is that we shall choose Shame, and then have War thrown in a little later on even more adverse terms than at present.’\n\nWhen Chamberlain returned to Britain on 30 September with his piece of paper declaring peace for our time, the Munich Agreement was to be debated in the House of Commons for four days. Churchill spoke on 5 October, the third day of the debate; and again while he did not say this exact quote, none could doubt that that was nonetheless what he meant. Author Andrew Roberts describes this as “the greatest speech of Churchill’s life thus far”:\n\n*He and his Party had long parted ways; friends like Jack Mottistone, Ian Hamilton, the Duke of Windsor, Charles Londonderry, Bendor Westminster and David Lloyd George had all praised appeasement, and some even the Fuhrer himself. Churchill had not held office for nine years and had been passed over for it on four occasions, and he was speaking to a House that was about to vote in favour of the Munich Agreement by 366 to 144. Yet still he produced something sublime.\nChurchill declared that, “we have sustained a total and unmitigated defeat, and that France has suffered even more than we have.” In summarising the compromises offered to Hitler, he said, “£1 was demanded at the pistol’s point. When it was given, £2 were demanded at the pistol’s point. Finally, the dictator consented to take £1 17s. 6d. [that is, 93.75% of £2 in pre-decimal currency] and the rest in promises of goodwill for the future.” *\n\nOf Czechoslovakia, Churchill said:\n\n‘All is over. Silent, mournful, abandoned, broke, Czechoslovakia recedes into the darkness. She has suffered in every respect by her association with the Western democracies and with the League of Nations, of which she has always been an obedient servant... It must now be accepted that all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will make the best terms they can with the triumphant Nazi Power. The system of alliances in Central Europe upon which France has relied for her safety has been swept away, and I can see no means by which they can be reconstituted.’\n\nHe concluded with an ominous warning to the Commons:\n\n‘And do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigour, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.’\n\nI mean, no-one can doubt from these passages that Churchill did sincerely believe that dishonour had been chosen, that war would follow, and that he personally appears to have been fond of the phrase “choosing between war and shame”. It’s just that, in an age where fake news thrives and there is non-benign state interference in media; I believe it’s super important for us to not muddy the historical record. Sorry! :-)\n\nWhat’s notable for me about Churchill post-Munich is that he was warning his peers about the dangers of giving up so much to the nazis; despite heavy pressure from his front-bench conservative colleagues to shut up and toe the party line in support of the Munich Agreement. Immediately after giving that speech Churchill ended up having to fight against deselection as the Conservative candidate for his Epping constituency.\n\nNow think about Zelenskyy facing pressure from his US “peers” to resign as president of Ukraine in the interests of “peace”. Not too dissimilar to Churchill in a way.\n\nSources:\n\nTim Bouverie, Appeasing Hitler: Churchill, Chamberlain, and the Road to War\n\nRichard Langworth, Churchill’s Words: Choosing Between War and Shame - And Getting Both\n\nAndrew Roberts, Churchill: Walking With Destiny\n\nWilliam Manchester, The Last Lion vol 2.",

That news induced a heart attack from which he was revived by an injection from Hitler's doctor. Hácha then agreed to sign the communiqué accepting the [German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia)\n\nWe've seen where this goes. The German occupation of the Sudetenland was immediately followed by annexation of the rest of the country. This is what fascists do. They hound you endlessly with easily disprovable lies and bad faith arguments backed up by the threat of force until you're too exhausted to fight back, and the moment you surrender anything, they try to take everything.\n\nDon't stop fighting back.",

You’re gambling with World War III,**” self explanatory. This is also projection/blame-shifting. He's also trying to gaslight people (his supporters) into thinking he's the hero and Zelenskyy is the villain through performance. Donald is clearly the one who's gambling with WWIII and this narrative is an attempt to trick Zelenskyy into thinking he has no choice.\n\n\"*You owe me for everything I've done for you.*\" - Trump’s remark, **“I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy. And I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States**,” suggests that Ukraine’s strength is solely due to U.S. support. He's also belittling Zelenskyy attempting to undermine his self-esteem &amp; create a sense of inferiority.  \n**^(This is also an example of)** \\*\\*\\*^(devaluation)\\*\\*\\***^(, a feature of NPD opposite to idealization. Devaluation is when a narcissist tries to dictate the value of a person or group of people by attempting to manipulate others into believing the value of the person/people being spoken about is lower than it is. It's also devaluing when the narcissist is directly engaging with a person or people they're devaluing, as in the example above.)**  \nDonald hasn't empowered anyone. Biden Admin pushed assistance and he's taking credit for it as he has before.\n\nVance’s comment, “**You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict,**” implies that Ukraine is ungrateful and shifts the blame onto Zelenskyy; as if he's at fault for something, when he isn't, From the perspectives of people who support this regime, when they hear an accusation like this *they automatically assume* someone (in this case Zelenskyy) is at fault without observing any evidence beforehand. They simply trust a statement like that wouldn't be said unjustifiably. Vance is suggesting that no other country would offer the same support and that he should be more appreciative. This also belittles Zelenskyy and undermines Zelenskyy's efforts to bring an end of the conflict, and undermines the seriousness of the situation. Once again thay're acting as if credit is theirs for everything the Biden/Harris' admin did made happen. This somewhat mirrors *love bombing tactics* where a narcissist engages in excessive gift giving with the target, but only because they plan to hold it all over their head later and say things like \"look at all ive done for you.\" \"I gave you this, that, and this, and this is how you treat me?\" Its often part of the Idealization &gt; Devaluation abuse cycle.\n\n“**Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel because you’re in no position to dictate that,**” is yet another example of blame shifting. As well as gaslighting, and projection. Trump himself is dictating the terms of the conversation like a dictator. Projection is a manipulation tactic where a manipulator accuses the other person of having traits or behaviors they themselves exhibit. This quote is a good example IMO to illustrate just how manipulative these people are. This shit is sick, and they do it all the time. The first part: \"***Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel*** \\- \" is something victims of gaslighting might say to a gaslighter to defend themselves from gaslighting statements in real-time. If you reference the part of the other paragraphs about supporters of this regime \"assuming,\" wrongdoing based on the existence of an accusation, without observation; that applies here too. When they hear something like that, their minds are highly likely to 'fill in the blanks' and instantly *assume* the other person did something wrong to deserve what was said to them.\n\nIts the equivalent of someone in a room of people pretending they were mistreated in some way by someone else in the room near them when no one was looking, but instead of people in the room questioning whether the event took place, they assume the person would have never accused someone and react so strongly unless it was a genuine reaction to something that actually happened.",

The draft agreement, which should unblock further cooperation between the parties in a peaceful settlement, turned out to be much tougher than the first version that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant brought to Kyiv a few days ago, NV is told by five people working on the new draft agreement.\n\nThe new version from the American partners proposes to secure 100% ownership of the future fund for the United States and to distribute the parties' contributions to the fund in a ratio of two to one, where the Ukrainian side contributes two-thirds in future revenues from mining, and the American side - one-third, which it has already provided in the form of weapons. The American side proposes to set the size of the fund at $500 billion. The agreement covers not only minerals, but also gas and oil. Future revenues from ports are not included in the agreement.\n\nThe American side considers the agreement purely commercial and puts the discussion of security guarantees outside the scope of this agreement. Also, within the framework of the agreement, the United States does not assume any investment obligations.\n\nThe Ukrainian side proposes to review the volume of the fund and establish the need to use the fund's money exclusively for investments in Ukraine.\n\nAll sources involved in the work on the contract consider the new draft to be stricter than the previous one and are inclined to believe that Kyiv will be forced to sign the agreement in the near future in order to unblock cooperation on a peaceful settlement.\n\nAlthough experts believe that Ukraine has large volumes of rare earth minerals, the size of the deposits and the economic feasibility of their extraction remain unexplored.  Most experts involved in the process of agreeing on the agreement on the Ukrainian side consider it advisable to prioritize unblocking cooperation with the American side over the details of implementing the agreement, which could drag on for a long time and encompass the new American administration after Trump.",

If it can curtail the corruption it inherited from the soviet era.\n\n\nTrump may believe the world still wants to beat a path to the USA’s door and that everyone will come crawling, begging to be let in, but it is no longer 1946, and whilst the USA may still be the world’s largest stand-alone economy, global trade is not as heavily dependent on that economy as it once was.\n\nIf you make it difficult for people to trade with you, there’s a very good chance some of them will start to look elsewhere. And where they are successful, others will follow, leaving Trump and his advisors peering of their walls Chad like and asking “where did everyone go?”.\n\nPerhaps we should be sending mining and earth moving equipment along with the bombs and bullets, and help Ukraine exploit its own mineral wealth and sell that on the global market.\n\nAn overly simplistic view I know.",

He isn’t pushing back, or trying to achieve them by going to congress, even though he has a majority there.\n\nHe pitched a low-ball minerals deal offer, claiming Ukraine owes him half of Ukraine’s resources and infrastructure GDP forever, for 90b of aid provided during Biden’s era, which he multiplied by 5 in his head, and figured he needs to provide nothing back. \n\nHe talked to Putin to scare Ukraine into accepting this deal. \n\nKyiv unceremoniously told him to go eat a bag of d***s (technical term), while Europe went into rapid de-investment from reliance on US security, realizing that when they’ll need US help what they’ll get isn’t help, but extortion and an attempt to exploit their weak moment and indenture them forever. The live demo was seen, received, and well understood. \n\nLike with the courts in the US, here too, Trump fucked around, and now he’s finding out there’s a fight there. And Trump doesn’t like fights. \n\nSo now we’re getting news they’re working on a less low-ball deal.\n\nZelensky isn’t a victim in this. He and his leadership and negotiation team are doing a good job playing a strong hand. \n\nYes, Trump nihilism can be seen as a betrayal by the American people.

Will the United Nations still exist? \n\nI want a 500k strong joint European Military force backed up by several hundred fighter jets before summer, pronto. We already have the active duty personnel in Europe for this. **It doesn't have to be an official European Army yet but a coalition of the willing**, just create the command structure, add the troops, use English the Lingua Franca, but at the same time put soldiers from the same nationalities in the same units as much as possible if you can to boost morale. Austria-Hungary fucked this part up big time in WW1 and they were even weaker than Russia. \n\nBritain is invited too, along with Norway and all EU nations. We can hit 500k from both new recruits and existing armed forces. Let's be realistic, my country, The Netherlands, has like 50k troops. We could easily spare 40k of them and keep 10k at home. 500k is peanuts. Pay these soldiers western European salaries even if they are from a poorer country. This salary could even come from the EU whatever. Quick decisions must be made. \n\nThe explicit goal of this military force is to defend EU (and Norwegian/UK) territory at all costs. A secondary goal is they might be needed in Ukraine and anyone signing up must be aware of that. Send them to the Baltics, Poland, Romania, and have them perform training exercises to get familiarised with each other. \n\nEssentially a coalition if the willing, with a command structure similar to NATO, but without the US. France and Britain are currently most suited to lead this anti-Russia force at the highest level. In the future, Germany and Italy could play bigger roles. \n\nIt's a bandaid solution until we can establish an actual European Military, which would be focused around the EU but hopefully with Britain, Norway and others as partners in a mutual defense treaty.\n\nEdit: I am aware that actually equipping 500k troops with more than just small arms is difficult, but we have time to ramp that up and firm more and more artillery/MLRS brigades, mechanised brigades and, in collaboration with Ukraine: Drone operator units. \n\nBtw, Canada, New Zealand and Australia are invited too.\n\nEdit 2: I am also aware that these are not 500k combat troops, although all will be armed. Lots will be in logistics and other roles. Russia and Ukraine have 1 million troops each but afaik those also include the logistical backbone and the actual combat troops are 20% of that or less.\n\nEdit 3: it's literally on our continent with good roads and only a couple hundred kilometers away, I don't want to hear about how difficult this would be. We should build field bases in the countries mentioned above to keep the troops comfortable. And safe with AA.",

Submarines, ICBMs that can reach anywhere in the world, missiles from a plane.\n\nIf the USA dares criticise us for getting more nukes, which they will, we will tell them they forced our hand, and point out their stockpile. \n\nFrance has nukes and I trust that that should be a sufficient deterrent for the Americans to try and stop Europeans producing a couple hundred more nukes. \n\nIf we can get France and Britain to formally \"forgive\" Germany for it's sins 80 fucking years ago, Germany can get 200 nukes too. Poland should also get like 25 of them (they are expensive, large drain the economy). \n\nItaly can get like 100. \n\nIf Spain wants like 50,  why not. \n\nI would even support my own country, NL, getting like 20 nukes that WE control, for our fighter jets but perhaps also for a future nuclear capable submarine. Our harbours and ASML make us aprime strategical target. We currently host American nukes but they are under American control, they can go back home. \n\nOf course there should be a very clear nuclear doctrine from all these nations, also within the context of the EU. I like the French one. \n\nNow Europe has sufficient deterrence, and internally there will be a healthy power balance instead of France dictating things because they are the only EU state with nukes. And Poland's paranoia over Germany will hopefully be satisfied.\n\nThen, we could even extend that nuclear umbrella to Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but it's still a long stretch if Europeans are really going to Initiate MAD over a country not even close to their continent :( At the same time, would the US risk it?",

That's plenty for our security needs, we don't need a budget as big as the US and military bases all over the world. \n\n3%, €500 billion is perfectly manageable without significant cuts to our healthcare. If the UK is on board we actually do approach the US defense budget. And this budget is mainly for a fortress Europe and control over the Mediterranean and some anti piracy patrol ships around the horn of Africa. And this is gonna happen, every European loves their low or lack of healthcare bills , they feel unsafe thanks to Trump, so some form of resource pooling and a European fighting force will be created. Likely as a sister treaty to the EU so the UK and Norway could join without joining the economic part, even Ukraine could join it if there is peace and teach us about drone warfare. This force, after training together, copying NATO's solution to the language barrier, will be the second most powerful military force in the planet. \n\nWith affordable/free healthcare. \n\nThe US government spends more money on healthcare per capita than any other country. The reason the US doesn't have free healthcare is because the US government allows Big Pharma to make healthcare 10-100x more expensive than in Europe. **It's completely unrelated to your defense spending.**",

    "selftext": "**Video of the Week:** \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1iomliq/video/yyahnh7vkxie1/player\n\n* This video shows a highly accurate strike against a Russian position underground with a French AASM Hammer Guided Bomb. These bombs have proved extremely effective in Ukraine so far, putting the JDAM to shame. This is because the Hammer has multiple different guidance systems including Inertial, GPS, infrared, and laser guidance, meaning it is able to still attack targets accurately even when GPS signals are being jammed, unlike the JDAM.\n\n**What Would a Good Peace Deal for Ukraine Look Like?**\n\n* With Trump announcing that peace negotiations have begun, I want to use this space to sketch out what I think a good peace deal would be.\n* Ukraine should get some amount of territory back from Russia in exchange for the territory they hold in Kursk. It probably makes the most sense for Russia to pull back out of Kharkiv Oblast entirely in exchange for Ukraine pulling out of Kursk.\n* Frontlines will be frozen and possibly turned into new national borders. It would take Ukraine years at this point, if it will ever happen at all, for them to take back the territory Russia has occupied. Much of that territory Russia has occupied for more than 10 years. Pete Hegseth was not wrong when he said it was unrealistic for them to consider any return to the 2014 border, as bitter a pill that is too swallow.\n* Some, but not all sanctions on Russia will probably have to be lifted, though ideally as few as possible.\n* Any demilitarization whatsoever by Ukraine should be firmly rejected as a complete non-starter. The UAF are the backbone of any deterrent Ukraine has against Russian aggression going forward.\n* European peacekeeping troops should be brought in to enforce the ceasefire, under the auspices of the European Union. Europe has the most to lose from any loss of Ukrainian sovereignty, and it makes sense for them to shoulder most of the load of protecting Ukraine going forward.\n* Europe (and ideally the United States) should offer Ukraine strong security guarantees, including consistent military aid, and a promise that EU forces will directly assist Ukraine should Russia invade in the future. This is going to be the most difficult aspect of the negotiations, but something like this is absolutely necessary to ensure Russia won't simply try again in 5 to 10 years.\n* I would very much like Ukraine to have some kind of path to NATO membership, though that seems unlikely. More likely would be a major non-NATO ally status like Japan or Australia, which would still make possible closer military cooperation. We have a lot to learn from Ukraine, particularly in the drone space.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nKursk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmjg5s3fkxie1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed871937c2a88a3e988c05117e6cf261992c02aa\n\nKursk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uupib24gkxie1.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ee5c43855d23c3f2da1c79db3d3ede695383bec\n\n* Ukrainian troops have made a significant advance south of Sudzha in the last week.

Ukraine appears to have launched a limited offensive and taken a bit of territory southwest of Pokrovsk, these usually don't have much significance, but there's some amount of hope they may be able to push this further and cut off the Russian advance across the southern Pokrovsk highway. As far as I know, however, Ukraine has never successfully managed to cut off and surround a significant Russian advance.\n\nVelyka Novosilka last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2w5m8hskxie1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=165e35e9c352360b4b28115e6421561f76583519\n\nVelyka Novosilka this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpzqijttkxie1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb96239b83dbeab95f8a0fa8da534375b83ef572\n\n* No changes here.\n\n**Events this Week:**\n\n* Donald Trump spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin yesterday after Russia released an American they have held hostage for years. He said they had a good call and agreed to begin peace negotiations. He spoke with Zelensky soon afterwards, and Zelensky posted a statement saying he was also ready to begin peace talks. It does not appear, however, that Trump told Zelensky that he would be speaking to Putin before it happened. Zelensky is still trying very hard to stay on Trump's good side, so we don't know exactly how he feels about this. But he's been very clear that any peace negotiations must involve Ukraine and can't be unilaterally decided by the US and Russia.\n* While some have accused Trump of abandoning Ukraine, I for one don't see that so far. These quotes from an article on The Economist were interesting to me: \"In comments later in the day, Mr Trump seemed to adjust his position. “I’m backing Ukraine,” he insisted. He predicted that Ukraine might get some territory back, and said America would continue to support it as long as assistance was “secured”—perhaps a reference to a deal on rare earths. “If we didn’t do that then Putin would say he won,” added Mr Trump.\"\n* It is unfortunately very difficult with Trump to see where exactly he is on any given issue because he says whatever shit comes into his head and is very easily manipulated. But most of his closest advisors and his Ukraine envoy are relatively hawkish and pro-Ukraine, and there is still a significant chunk of the GOP that has hawkish, anti-Russian views. The real test will come when the negotiations actually begin. The most important things as far as I can see are preserving and increasing the strength of the Ukrainian military and providing them the strongest security guarantees possible.\n* France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Spain, and the UK put out a statement saying they are prepared to increase support for Ukraine, committed themselves to its sovereignty, declared that any negotiations need to include Europe and Ukraine as equal partners, and made clear that strong security guarantees are necessary.\n* Russia's 2024 military budget has now been projected to have reached 462 billion dollars, more than total EU spending of 457 billion, representing 40% of Russia's total budget. This is a staggering amount of money.\n* Ukraine claimed this week to have reached a new milestone of 10,000 Russian tanks destroyed. While this is probably an overstatement, I don't think the real number of destroyed Russian tanks is that far off from this number. My personal estimate is between 6 and 8 thousand.\n* Ukrainian troops shot down a Russian Su-25 attack plane with an Igla MANPADS system near Toretsk.\n* There is increasing evidence of a severe shortage of armored vehicles in the Russian army, with units observed using donkeys to move supplies and making even more attacks with civilian vehicles. While there are legitimate roles to play in this war for donkeys and sedans, it's definitely not a good sign for the Russians that they have to resort to using them more.\n* Russia has built a fenced, mesh-covered road 2 kilometers long to protect their supply line from Bakhmut to Chasiv Yar. The fact that they felt they had to do this is another testament to the strength of Ukrainian drone attacks against Russian supply lines.\n* Ukraine pulled an Israel style move and send packages of FPV goggles to Russian soldiers which were actually loaded with explosives set to detonate when the goggles are put on. We don't know how many Russians were killed or injured by this, but at least some have been.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 20,309 (+91)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,744 (+10)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,467 (+24)\n* Russian SPG losses: 881 (+4)\n* Russian SAM losses: 300 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 136 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 151 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 7,814 (+68)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,070 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,214 (+10)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 463 (+5)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 166 (+0)\n\nSlightly lighter than average Russian losses this week, and average or may a bit higher than average Ukrainian losses.\n\nThank you for reading!",

U.S. policy was never going to change with Trump getting elected to send US troops to push Russia out, so what was the hope here?\n\nThis proposal seems to stop further bloodshed while giving Europe a chance to put it on the line for the Ukrainians and secure the line of contact and finally giving Europe a way to forge a path forward regardless of what's happening in the US.\n\nOnce Putin croaks and Russia devolves as it eats itself, the European coalition army can liberate the rest of Ukraine.",

    "selftext": "Hello r/Ukraine! I've been studying this conflict since 2014 and have been writing these updates for the past year and a half. Recently I've had to find a new home for these updates on Reddit, and this seemed like the best place to go. The mods here have given me their blessing, so I will be posting here every week from now on until the war ends. \n\n**Video of the Week**:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ik8vzu/video/khad6v9hrjhe1/player\n\n* This video depicts a Russian MBT (a heavily modified T-72 variant) as it is attacked and destroyed by Ukrainian FPV drones. The crew and dismounts appear to all have survived.\n\n**Why is US Military Aid to Ukraine Important?**\n\n* Establishing the precedent that nations can take territory by force once more is dangerous for the whole world, particularly when it comes to China and Taiwan.\n* Russia specifically poses a credible threat to the NATO alliance, especially if NATO is perceived as weak and not unified. Part of the point of the war is Russia testing the United States to see how far it will go to defend European countries.\n* The aid we've provided so far is a tiny percentage of our total military budget. Much of what we've given is obsolete equipment by our standards that would cost money for us to hold on to or destroy.\n* The war has shown how much more effective our military equipment is than Russia's creating demand for our equipment all around the world, benefiting the US economy and our global standing. Much of the aid money dedicated to new production has also been spent in the US, further stimulating our economy.\n* Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in return for security guarantees, and if we fail to live up to that commitment, it makes other countries far more likely to pursue nuclear weapons, dealing a huge blow to anti-nuclear proliferation efforts.\n* A stronger Ukraine can negotiate a more favorable peace deal with Russia that ensures a lasting peace, and not a period of re-armament and re-invasion.\n\n**Maps (all images pulled from the Institute of the Study of War):**\n\nKursk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbqlrd7lrjhe1.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e2092d5817fa25aaf90c1dcd79dab479e9ff404\n\nKursk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8f4cjp1orjhe1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83baf85f9786d492997d038a4b233b4f92d4f450\n\n* No changes here, though I saw today that Ukraine has done another limited attack in this area that seems to have been successful. Russia as far as I can tell has given up hope of reclaiming this region even though Putin declared it a top priority months ago. And now that the North Koreans have been pulled off they line, they just don't have much offensive capability left here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4ddj64srjhe1.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4360a60d3c6914e02b25a97aa9fbf79240bbb80f\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eryrb862sjhe1.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e9508db9ce7d1882d5ba73ffbe618459e4b7287\n\n* Russia has slightly expanded the salient southwest of Dvorichna.\n\nKreminna last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t3fhrg3sjhe1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aac15e276e8dc1f9d1708171b1f0eb34765433e\n\nKreminna this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7ob70o4sjhe1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8a0d2d0856820c6601181d618b3ee322540204b\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fq4iet5sjhe1.png?width=881&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ef70b56635288f4c9790f6edefe19a4177fcc64\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4c4j1hy6sjhe1.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a71b6dece19350d2d6b55b7993f37c8d384ff94\n\n* Russia advanced significantly within Chasiv Yar and also took a chunk of territory to its south.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ypthd99sjhe1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4adb145ef49c66a51bc55569f253d012d34c4c8\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3toi7qasjhe1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b40b474c350d2f2a21cf8e522b858e5ab6a6ed\n\n* Russian forces are still on the move here though they are slowing down. Still no fighting within Pokrovsk, though it seems it's only a matter of time before there is. I am very doubtful that they will be able to complete an encirclement of the town, however. And Pokrovsk still has two good open supply roads.\n\nVelyka Novosilka last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flv0gyrdsjhe1.png?width=1154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52871e0ffd2a3f3210728c0244ed7d76d1d38b45\n\nVelyka Novosilka this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zvf089fsjhe1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=499b2f40efce24a53959c8ac0b9c620c1798c4c5\n\n* Russia has consolidated their gains around Velyka Novosilka, though I've read that the geography north of the town is much more defensible than the town itself. There were also reports that many Russian soldiers were killed there after being caught in a \"fire trap\" by Ukrainian drones and artillery.\n\n**Events This Week:**\n\n* Months ago, Zelensky floated an idea to sell Ukrainian mineral and rare earth reserves to the US in exchange for military aid. That idea seems to have had an intended audience of one, Donald Trump, and he has now expressed explicit interest in pursuing this deal, or at least using it as a cover to continue military assistance for Ukraine, which as far as I can tell is still ongoing. Zelensky continues to prove himself as the Trump whisperer, which in retrospect is not surprising considering they both have an entertainment background, and Zelensky is a keen observer of what works and what doesn't when it comes to pressuring Western leaders.\n* Bloomberg reports that the Trump team, led by retired general and Ukraine supporter Keith Kellog, is finalizing a peace plan to begin negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to stop the war. Key elements of the plan including freezing the front line, withdrawing Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory (without ceding that territory back to Ukraine) and giving Ukraine security guarantees. The most important element of this plan has to be the security guarantees, if they are weak or easily abandoned, then it is a terrible plan, if they are strong and will protect Ukraine from another invasion, then as far as I'm concerned, it's about as good as we're going to get. Ukraine is going to have to come to terms with the fact that they will have to let go of some of their territory, but at this point, there aren't any alternatives, and ending the war and stopping the intense bloodshed is an admirable goal that should be pursued with great vigor. I'm still skeptical that Putin will come to the table in good faith, but I do think that if these negotiations fail, Trump is likely to step up support for Ukraine, so Putin does have good reason to actually try and make something work. And any deal that preserves the strength of the Ukrainian military and provides them strong security guarantees will mean that the war was on the whole a massive failure for Russia, because their primary goals are to demilitarize Ukraine and bring it back into Russia's orbit.\n* Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia was ready to negotiate with Zelensky, and also said that contacts between Russia and the US have been ongoing and serious.\n* The Ukrainian Parliament ratified a 2 billion Euro loan agreement with the UK. They will use this money to buy air defense systems, missiles for those systems, and repair bases for military equipment.\n* Reuters published an article this week describing how aid for Ukraine was consistently slowed down in the past year by Biden administration officials who couldn't make up their minds about what levels of aid would be too escalatory. It's a capstone on the Biden admin's immense failure to fully follow through on their public support for Ukraine, because they were handicapping them in secret the whole time so that they wouldn't piss off Russia too much.\n* Ukraine is now using FPV interceptor drones which are launched from drone motherships to down Russian intel drones. This is a remarkable evolution of cheap air defense technology that has significantly hampered Russia's ability to find and destroy Ukrainian targets effectively.\n* Ukraine's strike campaign against Russia oil continues, with several more targets being hit this week. One report claims that if the current rate of attacks continue, Russian gasoline production will halve by July, which would put a significant amount of pressure on the Russian government and economy.\n* Zelensky's main opposition candidate, former president Petro Poroshenko, has ruled out pushing for any elections while the war is ongoing, saying that they would only help Putin.\n* Zelensky claimed that another Russian command post was hit in Kursk, with many Russian officers and North Korean troops killed. This claim is unconfirmed, but they have successfully carried out strikes like this in the past, so it's a credible claim.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 20,218 (+150)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,734 (+24)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,443 (+54)\n* Russian SPG losses: 877 (+6)\n* Russian SAM losses: 299 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 135 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 151 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 7,746 (+115)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,062 (+15)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,204 (+30)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 458 (+6)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 166 (+0)\n\nHeavy losses on both sides this week. Ukrainian losses have definitely ticked up the past few weeks, while this week Russian losses have returned to their usual dire state after a few weeks of lighter losses.\n\nSlava Ukraine!",

His conciliatory attitude to Russia the first go around isn't getting him any favors from Putin for a swift, palatable resolution to the war that would be acceptable by the vast majority of the US.  He probably felt he could offer up something juicy, but acceptable to Russia, kick the conflict can down the road to the next guy, and look like The Great Negotiator.  That's not going to work if Russia is unwilling to budge on the Vassal State of Ukraine, which all appearances seem to indicate.\n\n\nPutin will be \"disloyal\" to Trump (even though anybody with half a brain could see that nonsuch thing ever existed), which will piss Trump off, and Zelensky for his part is kissing major ass to Trump and was very clearly not trying to pick a side in the election, and has been messaging far more reasonable concillations that would be amenable to even staunch isolationists.  I'm hoping this pays off for Ukraine in the future.\n\n\nThis isn't Trump playing 4D chess or what have you; it's just an assumption that Trump's narcissism and complete pettiness will win out, and he sides with the guys kissing his ass.",

        "body": "There’s no solid proof that Trump is Putin’s “puppet,” but plenty of actions and patterns raise eyebrows. Here’s a rundown, and any proof Putin has would not be common knowledge, or it would have any leverage would it:\n\n**Before his presidency**: Trump’s financial ties with Russia are a big red flag. He spent decades pursuing business deals there, like the Trump Tower Moscow project, which was still being negotiated during his 2016 campaign. Plus, Russian oligarchs, some linked to Putin, have bought his properties over the years. Then there’s Trump’s open admiration for Putin, calling him a “strong leader” when most U.S. politicians were critical of him.\n\nAnd don’t forget Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence concluded they worked to help Trump win. While Mueller didn’t find direct collusion, the report made it clear Trump’s campaign welcomed Russian help.\n\n**During his presidency**: Trump’s policies and behavior leaned suspiciously pro-Russia at times. He questioned NATO’s importance, even suggesting the U.S. might leave—music to Putin’s ears. At the 2018 Helsinki summit, Trump sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence on election interference, which was a jaw-dropping moment.\n\nHis actions toward Ukraine are another point of concern. He withheld military aid to Ukraine while pressuring them to investigate Joe Biden—right when Ukraine was battling Russian-backed forces. And his comments on Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed, were oddly soft compared to other Western leaders.\n\nThen there’s the secrecy. Trump met with Putin multiple times with no U.S. officials present and no formal records, even taking the interpreter’s notes. Why all the cloak and dagger?\n\n**After his presidency**: Trump’s rhetoric hasn’t changed much. He’s still critical of NATO and has even praised Putin’s “savvy” moves during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He also stayed close to figures like Paul Manafort, who had deep ties to pro-Russian groups in Ukraine.\n\n**But here’s the rub**: Some of Trump’s actions, like sanctioning Russian entities and expelling diplomats, were tough on Russia. And while people speculate Putin has dirt on him—like the infamous “pee tape”—there’s no hard evidence.\n\nSo, is he Putin’s puppet? Maybe not literally, but his actions raise real questions. Whether it’s admiration for Putin’s style, business interests, or something darker, it’s hard to ignore the pattern.",

Access to oil and other energy types and control over Ukrainian trade also gives Trump a larger level of economic power in Europe as a whole. If Zelenskyy can lease or purchase weapons and equipment from the US on a larger scale, Russia’s economy will cripple and crash within the next 12-18 months most likely. The only way Putin could avoid this is by escalating this into a full blown war to ramp their economy via the MIC. I’m leaving for Ukraine after Christmas, and this in my eyes is a holy war.

There are very good reasons for it too, namely dealing with liability and international law.\n\n\n\nhttps://spacenews.com/shotwell-ukraine-weaponized-starlink-in-war-against-russia/\n\n\nLet's dispel another myth while we're at it:\n\n\n\n`Shotwell told reporters she led efforts to get Pentagon funding for Starlink services in Ukraine. “I was the one that asked the Pentagon to fund this. It was not an Elon thing,” she said. “We stopped interacting with the Pentagon on the existing capability.”`\n\n\nAnd what's more, not Elon, nor anybody else, permitted Russians to use the terminals for any purpose. Period. There's no magic mirror that can tell you who exactly is using any given terminal at any given time. I don't know what makes you think this is the case. How the Russians got hold of them is anybody's guess (whether stolen, black market, smuggled by spies, etc.) All that can be done, and is in fact being done, is those terminals get deactivated when they're discovered to have fallen into the wrong hands.\n\n\nYou guys should really take Zelensky's example on this one. If Elon really didn't like Ukraine, there'd be no starlink there at all. What Gwen asked of the Pentagon was completely fair.",

The Logan Act, enacted in 1799, prohibits unauthorized individuals from engaging in correspondence or negotiations with foreign governments concerning disputes or controversies with the United States. \n\nThis law is intended to maintain the integrity of the U.S. government’s foreign policy and ensure that only authorized representatives, such as elected officials and diplomats, engage in such discussions. Violating the Logan Act could potentially lead to legal consequences, although it has rarely been enforced in practice. \n\nIn summary, private citizens cannot legally negotiate with foreign governments on behalf of the U.S. without appropriate authorization.",

Rockefeller) dominated the US economy, media and, indirectly, much of local and federal government.\n\nThere was a series of anti-monopolies acts from 1914 which were only partially effective until the Celler–Kefauver Act of 1950.  So the period of 1950 to now was a relatively short period - during which the wealth of the average American citizen increased dramatically.

    "selftext": "G7 defence ministers back Ukraine's 'irreversible path' to NATO membership\n\n\n\nNAPLES, Italy (Reuters) - Defence Ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies support Ukraine's \"irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,\" they said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"We underscore our intent to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine, including military assistance in the short and long term,\" in its conflict with Russia, the G7 ministers said after their meeting in the Italian city of Naples.\n\nItaly holds the 2024 chair of the group which also includes the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. Representatives of the European Union, NATO and the Ukrainian defense minister also joined the talks in Naples.\n\n\n\nG7 defence ministers convened Saturday against a backdrop of escalation in the Middle East and mounting pressure on Ukraine as it faces another winter of fighting.\n\nItaly, holding the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven countries, organised the body's first ministerial meeting dedicated to defence, staged in Naples, the southern city that is also home to a NATO base.\n\nInvited to the one-day talks were NATO chief Mark Rutte and the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell.\n\nBorrell told reporters the group had much to discuss, including recent strikes on the UN's peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, and the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe summit comes two days after Israel announced it had killed Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel that triggered the devastating retaliatory war in Gaza.\n\n\"Certainly after the killing of Yahya Sinwar a new perspective is open and we have to use it in order to reach a ceasefire, to release the remaining hostages and to look for a political perspective,\" Borrell told journalists.\n\nA morning session included discussions over recent strikes on UNIFIL, the UN's Lebanon peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, where Israel is also at war with Hamas ally Hezbollah.\n\nBorrell suggested the peacekeepers' mandate should be beefed up by the UN Security Council to give them more scope to act amid repeated attacks on their positions they say are being conducted by Israeli forces.\n\n\"They cannot act by themselves, it is certainly a limited role,\" he said.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Borrell wrote on social media that \"a more robust mandate for UNIFIL\" was needed.\n\nIn Lebanon Friday, Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni slammed as \"unacceptable\" the recent strikes on UNIFIL.\n\nItaly has around 1,000 troops in the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which has soldiers from more than 50 countries.\n\nAs the Naples talks began, Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto told the group that the \"critical situation in the Middle East\", Russia's war in Ukraine, \"profound instability\" in sub-Saharan Africa and \"increasing tension\" in the Asia-Pacific region \"highlight a deteriorated security framework with forecasts for the near future that cannot be positive\".\n\n- Ukraine prospects -\n\nOn Ukraine, the ministers will contemplate Kyiv entering a third winter at war, battlefield losses in the east -- and the prospect of reduced US military support should Donald Trump be elected to the White House next month.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Western allies to forge a winning strategy against Russia, on Thursday presented what he called a \"victory plan\" to the European Union and NATO.\n\nIts main thrust is a call for immediate NATO membership, deemed unfeasible by alliance members.\n\nIt also demands the ability to strike military targets inside Russia with long-range weapons, and an undefined \"non-nuclear strategic deterrence package\" on Ukrainian territory.\n\nUnder discussion will also likely be reports, based on South Korean intelligence, that North Korea is deploying large numbers of troops to support Moscow's war against Ukraine.\n\nNATO was not as yet able to confirm that intelligence, Rutte said on Friday.\n\n\n\nNAPLES, Italy (Reuters) - Defence ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies kicked off their meeting on Saturday with host country Italy warning the global security framework is growing increasingly precarious due to competing visions of the world.\n\nThe G7 gathering marks the group's first ministerial meeting dedicated to defence and comes a few days after Israeli forces killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, whose death some Western leaders said raised the chances of an end to the conflict in Gaza.\n\nItaly holds the G7 rotating presidency for 2024 as the West also grapples with the Russian advance in Ukraine and China's military activities around Taiwan, as well as heightened tensions along the border of North and South Korea.\n\n\"The brutal Russian aggressions in Ukraine and the indeed critical situation in Middle East, combined with the profound instability of sub-Saharan Africa and the increasing tension in the Indo-Pacific region, highlight a deteriorated security framework,\" Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said in his opening speech.\n\nItalian officials said Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov had joined colleagues in the southern Italian city of Naples, where a discussion on developments in his country is expected.\n\nWarning that near term forecasts for global security \"cannot be positive\", Crosetto - a prominent member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party - said tensions were fuelled by a confrontation between \"two different, perhaps incompatible visions of the world.\"\n\nOn the one side are the countries and organizations that believe in a world order based on international law, Crosetto said, while \"on the other side, (there are) those who systematically disrespect democracy to pursue their objectives, including by a deliberate use of military force.\"\n\nCEASEFIRE APPEAL\n\nBefore the meeting, Crosetto welcomed photographers holding a model of a tiny red animal horn, a symbol of good luck according to time-honoured Neapolitan tradition.\n\nBesides Italy, the G7 includes the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Japan, with European Union and NATO representatives also attending the gathering in the southern Italian city.\n\nThe EU's chief diplomat Josep Borrell appealed for a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon and the freeing of the Israeli hostages still held by Hamas, saying the death of Sinwar should be seized as an opportunity for the cessation of hostilities.\n\nBorrell also urged respect for the U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon, which were recently targeted by Israel.\n\nHe told reporters the morning session mainly focused on the Middle East, and said the U.N. mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, could be reviewed but it would be up to the U.N. Security Council to make decisions on its future.\n\n\"Some of the members of this (G7) meeting are important members of the Security Council too,\" Borrell said.\n\nItaly is a major contributor to UNIFIL which is stationed in southern Lebanon to monitor hostilities along the demarcation line with Israel. Israeli attacks have angered Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who visited Lebanon and Jordan on Friday.\n\n",

We paid this fat bastard to do a job, and he spent four years playing golf, whining like a bitch, spewing hatred for anyone who didn’t kiss his ring, and getting his oversized ass impeached *twice*.\n\nTrump has no actual *plan* for anything.

Trump’s “plan” is “whatever that Russian wants” because Trump doesn’t care about anything or anyone other than himself and his quest for power.\n\n*My plan* is to vote against this motherfucker in November; to vote for whomever the Democrats give me.

In the very recent EU parliamentary elections, the fringes gained ground (the extreme on BOTH sides are Europsceptics), while the moderates lost some. Now, the flip wasn't as hard as most predictions expected it to happen, but it's undeniable that Euroscepticism is on the rise. TO put it simply, most European people don't consider themselves European. They consider themselves German, French, Hungarian, Italian, and so on. Being \"European\" is not an identity, the way being American is. As such, most EU citizens don't much care what's going on in Brussels, as long as it doesn't directly impact them, nor do they care. The election participation for European Parliament elections tend to be pretty low (40%+ counts as oddly high in most places). The notion for your average, say, Italian, that laws and policies and military matters would be decided in Brussels and not Rome, is about as welcome as an atheist gender studies professor in rural Utah. People want the free travel, want the united currency, and sometimes some development fund money, and they are alright paying some money in the big pot for it, but other than that, Brussels can fuck off and not put their nose where it doesn't belong.

He can publicly share his idea now, not waste time, so as not to lose people, and say, ‘My formula is to stop the war and stop all this tragedy and stop Russian aggression,’ say how he sees it, how to push Russia from our land. Otherwise, he’s not presenting the global idea of peace.”  \nZelensky concluded that “the idea is how to take the part of our territory and to give Putin, that is not the peace formula.”\n\nCNN host Wolf Blitzer then asked Zelensky if Ukraine was ready to cede territory to Russia.  \nSwitching to English, Zelensky replied: “We’re not ready \\[to give up territory to Russia\\]. But the question for Trump – or to someone else, maybe it’s not his idea – is ‘is the United States ready to give up territory after Putin has said he would use nuclear weapons?’\n\n“\\[Putin\\] has said publicly a lot of times that he can use nuclear weapons on Europe or maybe some other target.  \n“So it means that countries including the United States and the EU – countries that are afraid because people are afraid of such messages – are ready to give Putin what he wants.”  \nZelensky then said this would only reward Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and it would set the stage for more conflict driven by Russia.  \n“After we negotiate with Putin, he will then give us his new list of ‘wishes,’” he said.  \nWhile Zelensky is not a fan of Trump’s proposed plan, it has drawn praise from Putin, who said recently: “We surely hear that Mr. Trump says he will resolve all burning issues within several days, including the Ukrainian crisis.  \n“We cannot help but feel happy about it.”  \nIn an interview with NBC News published on Sunday, Trump appeared to revel in the praise, saying: “Well, I like that he said that…  \n“And I’d have a deal worked out. I would get a deal worked out. It would’ve been a lot easier before it started.”\"",

It has nothing to do with if the (U.S.) administration will remain the same or change,” he replied.\r  \n\r  \n“President Biden is the president during a full-scale war and has been more helpful to us than President Trump, if we are talking about administrations. But at the same time, we must remember that there was no full-scale war at that time and I’m not sure how Trump would have acted at that time.\r  \n\r  \n“In a situation like this, you are afraid of changes. And to be honest, when you mention a change of administration, I feel the same as anyone – you want changes for the better, but it can be the other way round.”\r  \n\r  \nTrump’s comments came on Thursday night during a town hall event on Fox News, where he also said he “got along with Putin” and made bizarre comments about the current waves of Russian missile and drone attacks against Kyiv.",

    "selftext": "I'm sure everyone has heard Putin's assertion that Ukraine is a \"fake country\". Such a ridiculous claim prompted me to really read and research the complete history of Ukraine and let me say, it was a wild ride.\n\nUkraine has been inhabited for thousands of years but up until around the year 900, Kyev was conquered and made the capital of the Rus; the Rus being an amalgamation of Nordic, Slavic and other races centered in the area. The Rus prospered but were invaded by the Mongols in the 13th century resulting in the complete destruction of Kyev.\n\nWith the withdrawal of the Mongols, more powerful, neighboring countries invaded and conquered resulting in Poland being the dominator. Fast forward 100 years, Bohdan Khmelnytsky led a rebellion, formed the Cossack Hetmanate and thus Ukrainian nationalism is born. Unforunately, after Khmelnytsky death 1657, neighboring countries waring between themselves and Ukraine resulted in a horrific period of time called \"The Ruin\" with control of Ukraine changing hands a number of times. Eventually, Ukraine was absorbed by Russia under Catherine the Great.\n\nAfter the revolution of 1917 Ukraine was structed to be a decentralized anarcho-communist Soviet, seeking autonomy and freedom of religion, and press done in Ukrainian language. Peasants stopped paying rent, land was relinquished from landlords and combined into a land trust with equity being shared between the workers of Ukraine. Unfortunately an independent Ukraine was absorbed  the Bolsheviks with all matters of state administration being done in Russian.\n\nThe pain and suffering felt by Ukraine and it's citizens under the orders of Stalin and eventually Hitler is unspeakable. Lenin's NEP plan was abandoned in favor of Stalin's forced collectivazation of grain resulting in a man made famine that claimed the lives of nearly 5 million people. This famine is called the Holdomor (otherwise known as The Great Hunger in english) \n\nBefore the invasion of Germany, Ukraine had a robust population of Jews numbering in nearly 3 million, after the war the population contracted over 70%. As of now, jewish population in Ukraine is less than 100,000.\n\nUkrainian history and culture is rich and storied. This is by no means a comprehensive telling of it's history but rather a few points that I found interesting but ultimately answering the absurd notion that Ukraine is a \"fake country\" -- It is not. Ukraine and it's people have demonstrated bravery and intelligence for hundreds of years which culminated to present day.\n\n I believe in karma. Not just karma in the personal sense but rather karma for different races, different people and most importantly, for countries. Poland and America owe a debt to Ukraine; Poland for it's occupation and America under Trump in his attempt to withold military aid to try and force Zelensky on political errand to try and implicate Biden in some bizarre corruption story he cooked up. I look forward to that debt being paid and seeing a free, autonomous Ukraine prosper.\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT**\nIf you want further reading, I suggest using the links in the automod's comment. I'll leave it up to mods to decide whether or not to keep this post up. As an American, my knowledge about Ukrainian history was slim; I wanted to write a brief history of Ukraine for others unaware of the rather heroic history of Ukraine and it's people.",

Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth kept the area somewhat protected. Polish were not nice to Ukrainians as they outlawed peasants owning land. But they did keep Prussians and Moscow at bay. Parts of Ukraine (Galicia) were also in Austro Hungarian Empire for awhile which introduced people to the idea of somewhat representative government as well as science and education. Freud was Ukrainian and went to Vienna, as did many Jews of Galicia. Chelminicki was a Ukrainian hero but he massacred whole Jewish communities. Like with Bandera, he has several sides.

Neither of these documents supported claims that Mueller found \"evidence\" of \"active collaboration\" with the Russians. The American side thought that they were interacting with Americans. \n\nThere is a report that substantiates one part of your statement, about Putin/Kremlin donating money to political campaigns to secure policies favorable to the Russians. However, that report does not mention whether or not he provided money to any party in the United States (per one of the linked articles).",

        "body": "**Response to misyo, September 18, 2022, Part 1A**\n\n**misyo:** A brief snapshot of Russian money going to Republican candidates. \n\nA reading of those \"snapshots\" do not exactly support the contention, mentioned above, regarding Putin sending money to support Republicans in the US. They are also dated. In the first link, the individuals in question were acting on their own self-interest, rather than that of the Russian government. The problem is that they are not American citizens, and those were not qualified to provide money to the campaign. \n\nIn the same article that you linked to, the Republican correctly acknowledged that he did not know that those individuals are not qualified to provide funding to his campaign. According to the first link, he declared his intention to turn that money over. The second part goes against the opinion that the Russian government is \"providing money\" to Republicans, and that the Republicans \"knowingly\" accepted money from Russia.\n\n**misyo:** Usually Russian donations are done through oligarchs or American shell companies to PAC, the PACs then distributed mo ey to the candidates. \n\nThose oligarchs are acting on their own best interests. They are not doing so at the best interest of the Russian government. As with other foreign donors, who contribute to both Democrats as well as to Republicans, the intent is the same as Americans who donate money in the same manner. They expect a specific candidate to pursue policies that benefit their businesses and interests.\n\nThe key, here, is whether the politician knowingly accepts foreign money, or if they accepted money from someone thinking that they are Americans.\n\n**misyo:** Accepting foreign donations is actually illegal in the US \n\nI know that.\n\n**misyo:** but with the untraceable billions that have poured into Super PACs via dark money donations, **frequently we don't know who the donors are.**\n\nThis statement supports those made by the Republicans in the link that you provided for this part of your statement. Additionally, you just explained how foreign donors, from other countries, can contribute to US candidates, indirectly. If those accepting the money don't actually know who the donors are, then how can one expect them to know that the people providing them with money are not American citizens? By extension, one can't even imply that these candidates are willingly accepting foreign money.\n\n**misyo:** Here is DeSantis taking Russia money while claiming ignorance. \n\nFrom your statement:\n\n\"...frequently we don't know who the donors are.\" -- misyo\n\nFrom your linked article:\n\n\"DeSantis said Wednesday he was unaware of the alleged illegal activities and that the two appeared 'legitimate.'\" -- Orlando Weekly\n\nYou cannot dismiss his statement as \"claiming ignorance\", while also stating that \"frequently we don't know who the donors are\". There is an imbalance there. Either we don't know who the donors are, or we claim that we don't know they are. DeSantis was being honest with his statement. \n\nNote that your article describes them as \"Soviet born South Florida businessmen\". This is an indication that he lived in the United States for long time, were doing business legally in the United States, but simply did not disclose their status which would have disqualified them from donating.\n\n**misyo:** You'll notice both men indicated for campaign finance charges worked for a Trump PAC and were regulars at RNC functions.\n\nThe first linked article that you provided indicated that they violated campaigns finance law. Mainly, that they did not disclose their status that would have disqualified them from providing political donations. If these individuals are not going to disclose themselves as foreign individuals, thus are not qualified to provide donations, what makes you think that those that they hang around with would suspect what these individuals do not disclose?\n\nAs Ron DeSantis stated in your first link, he was not aware that they were not qualified and that they were foreigners. Given that DeSantis did not know the qualification of these individuals, neither would those that they work for regarding the Trump PAC or the RNC functions... They would not know either.\n\nNow, going from an online propaganda publication (Orlando Weekly), I searched a valid link, and found this:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/lev-parnas-and-igor-fruman-charged-conspiring-violate-straw-and-foreign-donor-bans\n\n\"As alleged in the Indictment, the defendants broke the law to gain political influence while avoiding disclosure of who was actually making the donations and where the money was coming from.  They sought political influence not only to advance their own financial interests but to advance the political interests of at least one foreign official -- **a Ukrainian government official who sought the dismissal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine**.\" -- US Department of Justice\n\nThe reality was that these individuals were doing this in a bid on behalf of themselves, as well as that of at least one **UKRAINIAN** official. \n\n**But WAIT! There's MORE!** I searched the personal information for Lev Parnas, and what did I get? He is described as**UKRAINIAN-BORN.** Igor Fruman was born in **Belarus.** Hence, one of the reasons to my calling your link a propaganda site. They list \"Soviet\" to deceive the reader into believing \"Russia\". \n\nThis leads to my first question:\n\n**Were you wrong when you claimed that Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman were Russian? YES [   ] NO [   ]**\n\n**Copy and paste this question, it's yes/no options, then place an \"X\" in the box that represents your reply. Do not add to your response to this specific question.**",

Like receiving corporal punishment in school in addition to receiving it at home, doing school drills that involved playing \"hide and seek\" from the bomb from the sky, having and using a rotary phone, being the remote control to a three channel television that played the national anthem after the last programming, etc. As I mentioned elsewhere on this thread, I followed the Soviet Afghanistan war in the 1980s. I remember a lot of things. \n\n**misyo:** the NRA/Russian assets scandals in 2016 in which two Russians were arranging visits between NRA leaders and Russian government officials, as well as buying relationships with Republican officials, candidates, and party members through the NRA. The idea was that these 2 people were laundering Russian money through the NRA to Republican candidates.\n\nNow, **did you go through the attached PDF?** Because, if you did, you would have come away with something that was different from what was reported. First, this was done by Senate Democrats. Already, we have bias kicking in with regards to how this is being presented. Second, if you go through the report, you find that the NRA member was traveling to Russia for personal business purposes.\n\nThere was an attempt to combine personal business within an NRA mission, connecting with Russian gun enthusiasts, which would have received an NRA funded trip. Now, when it comes to business trips, there are people who would not only take care of the purpose for which the trip is conducted, they would also attempt to establish ties and open up other opportunities not related to the business trip. In this situation, meeting Russian gun enthusiasts, and then going on \"side missions\" to try to enhance one's business position.\n\nThe information, in the PDF, indicates that the trip to Russia was done more on a personal basis, rather than as official business on the NRA's part. Individuals that did the traveling did so to enhance their own business. If you read further down the NPR article, you will get the responses from both the NRA and the Republicans. So far, what I have seen in the PDF, the reactions from the NRA, and from the Republicans stated in the NPR article, are justified.",

Unfortunately, I cannot read this propaganda piece unless I have an email subscription to it. However, I got as far as seeing them reference the Mueller \"Russian collusion\" investigation. \n\nThe opinion piece that you linked to was dated in 2018, the Mueller Report was posted in 2019. Why is this key? As I indicated earlier, I've gone through the Mueller Report, as well as through the indictment drawn up by Mueller prior to that.\n\nI've debated against the left, online, for 19 years. One of the topics that I have argued is the one that we are arguing, specifically with \"Russian collusion\". The Mueller Report was the standard bearer for the left, when attempting to argue that the Republicans received funding and cooperation from the Russians. Yet, what does this report find?\n\nOther than someone acting on his own personal cognizance, without knowledge of the Trump campaign, working with a foreign national for his own personal business, there was no active effort on the Republican's part to receive funding or cooperation with the Russians. The Russians that did try to coordinate with elements of the campaign did so as fake Americans online. Those interacting with them online did not know that they were not Americans. \n\nOne trend that I found in the Mueller Report is consistent, so far, with the linked PDF provided in your first link. In both instances, Democrat authors tried to force the information that they collected to support a conclusion that the collected information... In totality... Did not support. **If you've taken a masters level or doctoral level research class, you'd understand that this is a \"no-no\", as it taints the entire information gathering process and the conclusions.** \n\n**misyo:** The Dem controlled Senate Intelligence Committee finds Russian meddling in the 2016 election, though the GOP controlled House didn't. Make of this one what you will. \n\nThis should tell you that the Democrats are politically motivated to damage the Republicans via falsehoods. Again, this link was posted in 2018. When was the Mueller Report posted? The following year. The Democrat-controlled Senate was doing what the mainstream media was doing, pulling strings to force a conclusion out of both information, and misinformation, being thrown about regarding \"Russian Collusion\".\n\nHowever, guess what happened to these conclusions, in these arguments, after the Mueller Report came out? The \"Russian Collusion\" pony stopped walking not long after that, and the Democrats dismounted from it and proceeded to try to find something else to bury Trump with. The Mueller Report contradicted the Democrat-controlled Senate's conclusion. \n\n**misyo:** I'll look for more sources later. Gotta wash some kids and get them to bed.\n\nAnd, just as I've done here, and in the past when others had advanced similar arguments and links that you just advanced here, I will respond just as you've seen with this current batch of responses. \n\n**misyo:** Trump's commerce secretary had ties to Russian oligarchs and bankers\n\nFrom your linked article:\n\n\"Ross has not been accused of wrongdoing and there is no indication the Russian deal violated US or EU sanctions. Ross resigned from the Bank of Cyprus board after he was confirmed as commerce secretary last month.\" -- The Guardian\n\nNow, compare this with the title and you would see a contradiction. One of my MOSs with the Army is Psychological Operations Specialist, or PSYOP. In PSYOP land, we call this propaganda. \n\nIn fact, the news and media today are not like what they were when I started following the news on a regular basis since the summer of 1982. The reality is that you have to validate what you read, to include clicking on linked references and going through one or more of them. In many instances, you'll find a contradiction between what the article is saying, and what that article's sources say.",

But, the reality is that he saw what Putin intended to do from a long way off. He understood, as many of us in the US military veteran community understand, that our enemies and adversaries will pounce when they think that we are weak. We must always show strength, something we've been failing to do since last year. \n\nWhen the European countries failed to take Trump seriously, when Biden showed weakness, and when Putin saw the cultural destruction that was going on in the West to include embracing things that were cultural abominations in the late 20th Century, Putin became emboldened and assumed that the United States was weak, and so was NATO. \n\nConsequently, the European countries ended up doing this year what they should have started doing when they were warned to do a few years ago. Many of the NATO countries are doing things this year what they should have started doing years ago. They could potentially have removed the wind from the sails of Putin's intended plans.",

Your arguments are among those that I've found that are consistent with media talking points but inconsistent with the facts. It's like you guys are passing around a script that you are all arguing from... It's like playing a computer game and coming across a non-player character that has a limited script and keeps saying the same thing, even if they are supposed to be \"different characters\" in different towns. \n\nAgain, I've been a news junkie since the summer of 1982. I know firsthand how the media tends to distort information to support a conclusion that the reporters/journalists want their viewers/readers to support. \n\nI'm not \"interpreting his words to make him look good\". I'm simply presenting the facts. I look at the bigger picture related to Trump, that factors in facts that the media does not want to talk about. Your side of the argument, on the other hand, take things out of context so that you could make him look bad. \n\n**Frigorifico:** You use the example of NAFTA, \n\nIt's a good example to use, as it provides a trend of Trump's mode of operation.

Man Made Global Warming is a myth that is not supported by science. In fact, I downloaded both studies, used by the media, that claims scientific consensus. Anybody that could understand academic jargon, and do simple math, would have a hard time seeing how those papers argue for such. \n\nThe reality is that we're in the beginning of a mini-ice age. Among the characteristics of this kind of trend is excessive droughts, extreme weather, weather extremes (going from extreme warm to extreme cold), etc. Preparing for warming when the world is getting cooler in the long trend is asking for a humanitarian disaster.\n\n**Frigorifico:** Would Trump have been happy with NATO if everyone spent more in defense? We can't know,\n\nYes, he would have been happy. Again, he knew what Putin was up to and what he wanted to do. A NATO following his advice could have psychologically prevented Russia from invading Ukraine in the first place. \n\nHe did not want other countries to take advantage of the United States. This included NATO countries not spending or investing in their militaries enough because the US was there. They needed to carry their fair share of the load in manpower and spending. \n\n**Frigorifico:** but given how much he admires Putin, I doubt it, he would have probably have found another reason to abandon it\n\nFalse on all accounts. Again, you're going by opinion head talking points, and not by the facts. The reality was that Trump would have been happy with a NATO that was carrying its fair share, especially one showing strength in front of the Russians. This was the ultimate objective of Trump's rhetoric towards their stubbornness. \n\nWhen Trump talked about Putin engaging in a good tactic, he meant it from a negotiation standpoint. This was not an indication that he agreed with what Putin was doing. A good negotiator, just as a good service member, respects the opposition, and recognizes when the opposition utilizes a good strategy. \n\nTHAT is what Trump was complimenting. Trump condemned Russia's subsequent invasion of Ukraine. \n\n**Frigorifico:** Truth is that Trump is a Russian asset, and by supporting him you are too **[INDUCTIVE FALLACY]**\n\nFalse, he's not a Russian asset. What you're mistaking as \"the truth\" is something that you, and those that I've argued this very point over the past few years, have spectacularly failed to prove or even present with a valid argument. I've downloaded and have gone through the Mueller Report. It does not support your claim that he's a \"Russian Asset\". The Russians that reached out to the Trump Campaign did so as fake Americans online. Those in the campaign that interacted with these individuals did not know that they were Russians... They thought that they were Americans.",

I started as a registered Democrat, then switched to Republican in the mid 1990s. This Century, I've had to deal with disappointment as one Republican after another claimed that they would do X, Y, and Z, yet fail to do that.  \n \nWhen 2016 rolled around, I was late to come around to support Donald Trump. When he got into office, he did one thing after another that I, and the majority of the GOP base, wanted politicians to do. The things that he did, the vast majority of them, needed to be done. The numbers spoke for themselves. Had these same numbers occurred under Obama, we would not hear the end of how Obama was responsible for the outcome.\n   \nThe racoon in the basement metaphor is applicable. Picture a homeowner with a racoon problem. This person could not remove these racoons, the local government couldn't get rid of them. None of the contractors that came to resolve the issue were able to do so. They provided the homeowner with one explanation after another as to why they could not get the racoons out of the basement.  \n\nThen, finally, someone comes along and offers to remove these racoons. Based on the homeowner's experiences with previous professionals, he's ready to dismiss this person. This final contractor tells the homeowner that he would do it for free. If the racoons are still there, the homeowner does not have to pay him a penny. The homeowner only pays if the racoons end up being gone, and the price is reasonable. \n  \nThe homeowner thinks, sure, what could hurt? The man comes in and presto! The racoons are gone. Impressed, the homeowner asks this individual how he did it. In the course of his explanation, the owner finds out that the previous contractors were simply full of baloney. Then, the other contractors and the local government conspired against this contractor and came up with false information about him to save their hides and their business. \n   \nDonald Trump did what we voted him to do. He stood up in situations that needed for him to have a backbone and to stand up. I could care less about how his \"attitude\" came off on people. I served most my adult life in the military; Trump is nothing compared to what I experienced. As long as he delivered, I could care less if he flamed people left and right. \n \nTrump fought to apply practical solutions to many of the issues plaguing the United States.  He also applied practical solutions when dealing with international affairs.",

Traditional neo-con conservatives are very hawkish and anti-Russia, and generally would support Ukraine more aggressively than the Democrats.  MAGA Trumpists on the other hand are very much pro-authoritarian, and Trump spent most of his time bolstering dictators like Putin and attacking our allies and traditional safety networks like NATO.  MAGA being the ascendant movement within the Republican party should be Ukraine's biggest concern, because the truth is Trump would have let Ukraine hang out to dry, and Zelensky is smart enough to know this.  So he is doing his best to fight for bipartisan anti-Russia consensus, using the leverage of US national pro-Ukraine polling to force the MAGA politicians to maintain at least lip-service to a pro-Ukraine position.

        "body": "You misunderstand the entire point of conservative media.\n\nThe point of Fox was to insist unilaterally that all media that came before it was, in fact, liberal. Now, it's certainly true that the conventional wisdom was that reporters were liberals and editors were conservatives, and it's also true that big business and big conservatives (like, mad-about-desegregation conservatives) don't like journalism because big business and people who get their power from government\\* really don't like their doings brought to light. Because humans who think no one can see them are really bad at resisting the temptation to do bad things.\n\nSo now you have a new player who looks just like all the other ones. But they have a different job. Their job is to take whatever the other outlets are saying and to say \"oh, that's not actually a big deal. If it was, we'd be on top of it. After all, we're journalists too.\" Step two is to say \"and look at this story the other outlets aren't covering. they must be corrupt!\" Sadly, the reality of political manipulation is honestly usually the case that whoever smelt it dealt it - Fox has been complaining about bias its whole life, and its sole singular purpose is to provide an \"out\" for viewers who would prefer conservatives to be right.\n\nSo now you never, ever have to bow to reality. Fox will always be there to guide you to a new fantasy where you were actually right.\n\nNow, do the other outlets suck at their jobs? Absolutely. Do they suck at their jobs because they're far leftists? No, they suck at their jobs because they work for multi-billion-dollar multi-nationals and their official viewpoint is one that favors multi-billion-dollar multi-nationals. They suck at their jobs because we don't have regional and local papers or journalists anymore, we have a handful of national outlets in NYC and DC, and they simply cannot cover an empire of 350 million effectively.\n\nBut that is not the same as Fox, which is simply doing something entirely different. The entire self-narrative of Fox is a fiction. This happens all over politics. Brookings was never the \"liberal\" think tank until Heritage declared itself the \"conservative\" one.\n\nSo yes, it's \"credible\" to conservatives, because the service they provide is not news, it's specifically designed to be a news-shaped escape pod from reality.\n\n\\*(spoiler alert: that's conservatives too - they just have a harder time getting the national government compared to state or local ones, but they looooooooove using state power more directly than liberals would ever dream - we're talking about a group that, again, was in favor of using the state to segregate people by color.

The more the working class in a country is divided, the easier they are to exploit (which is why conservatives always fuck over working class people like farmers and such, while pretendign they actaully care about them). Big multinationals can adopt more solidarity/liberal centered stances because their material interests are satisfied by exploiting the third world, so peace and equality within their parent country is something they can afford to \"fight for\" as it is beneficial to them (think Nike and pride month stuff; not saying that this representation isn't good, it absolutely is, but it's also just performative often).    \nTldr: conservative media wants their to be as much chaos and radicalization as possible.",

That buys him the chance to add even more right-wing ideological content into every news story and everything that goes on the air – as if there wasn't enough already. So in the name of fairness and balance, news stories must always contain an extra helping of right-wing agenda. And that's the reason for this whole myth about liberal media bias.

They also believe the invasion of Ukraine would not have happened if Trump had been in office. I wonder if Zelenskyy's interview might reach some of them?",

I’m sure one of the first things Ukraine is going to do is establish countermeasures to prevent this from happening again.  So what are some ideas for deterrence? \n\nFirst, a DMZ with fencing and mine work would probably  reluctantly be necessary.  A trump big beautiful wall would be too expensive.  Perhaps it might be practical in the most strategically dangerous spots.  Oh, you won’t be needing those roads and rail lines to Russia anymore.  Hedgehog all those bad boys. \n\nSecond, take a page from Tukhachevskys playbook:  a ridiculous series of tank obstacles and barricades that would force any future tank columns to be funneled to choke points and destroyed.  This is pretty reasonably friendly financially too \n\nThird, keep their new American artillery on the one millimeter line from the Russian border as a deterrent at Kharkiv and Luhansk with the implied message that if Ukraine detects any military movement they get shwacked even if they’re in Russian side of the border\n\nFourth, beg Israel to deliver that iron dome and compile air defense assets.  That gets expensive but I think ultimately is a necessity as well.  \n\nFifth, zelensky is already ahead of the game here, setting Ukraine up into an “Israel instead of a Switzerland”, basically with the implication that this will be a nation whose people will be well versed in defense and military measures\n\nWhat do you think would be some other good ideas as preventative measures in case Russia decides to be Russia again so Ukraine can be well prepared for it?",

But they will still need agreements from the west / guarantees to acquire the hardware to secure their own sovereignty, and make the process for gaining further support more automatic. \n\nAfter this war, it is unlikely that Ukraine would bank on any security guarantees anyway, and will probably have to treat any peace more like a cease fire in practical terms.  At least until Russia falls apart and gives up the idea of having an empire.  It's also unlikely Putin would agree to anything like a long term peace, since he seems to prefer ambiguity, and settling on paper for less than his goals could look like a defeat.

The more strategic inroad will come when they take Crimea and get Sevastopol back.

The pressure on the Russian economy will not let down after the war. The sanctions might recede, but no country in its right mind will want to become dependent on Russian energy (ever again).

This is not the case in this conflict, where both sides have well-organized, well controllable and equipped modern military machines. \n\nSecondly, there is no standing peace agreement between the parties in the Middle East conflict at the moment. We surely hope one will be reached between Ukraine and Russia after liberation of the Ukrainian territory.\n\nFinally, territorial scale of the conflicts is vastly different. In case of the Middle East, 15 - 50 km deep shell / unguided missiles attack can affect a significant fraction of the Israel and its population; in case of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, that reach would constitute only a minor border disturbance.\n\nSo no, the military will NOT bring a stability and a lasting peace to Ukraine.

That means that the kinds of arms Ukraine needs are changing. Kyiv’s commanders now need better air defense systems and longer-range weapons than they currently have to defend the bulk of the Ukrainian army in the country’s east.\n\nSo far, the Biden administration has not been willing to provide weapons that would allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia, though some experts say that damaging Russian military airfields would improve Ukraine’s chances of withstanding a renewed offensive.\n\nThe Biden administration did say last week it will [work with U.S. allies to transfer Soviet-made tanks](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/us/politics/us-tanks-ukraine.html) to bolster Ukrainian defenses in the Donbas region. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine [has pleaded with the United States and its allies to send tanks and warplanes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/26/world/europe/zelensky-renews-his-call-for-planes-and-tanks-from-nato.html).\n\nUkrainian forces are best prepared to use Russian-designed systems of the kind that Warsaw Pact countries deployed in the Cold War. NATO countries in the alliance’s eastern flank still have stocks of those weapons and have said they are willing to give them to Ukraine if they are provided with newer replacements.\n\nThe Russian-designed S-300s are a good example. [Slovakia’s prime minister said on Friday](https://twitter.com/eduardheger/status/1512386024399376389?s=20&amp;t=Kz8MpFW1oK67xc7DB8zjOw) that his country had provided the system to the Ukrainians, and [the United States announced it would provide Patriot air defense systems to Slovakia](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/08/world/ukraine-russia-war-news), with other potential deployments to come. It remains unclear whether the S-300s have been delivered to the front lines yet.\n\nThe Ukrainians have the system in their inventory and already know how to use it. The S-300 will allow the Ukrainians to defend against several Russian aircraft attacking at once.\n\n“This is additional capacity,” said retired Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former top Army commander in Europe. “It’s a very accurate system.”\n\nAnother European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military planning, said on Friday that NATO nations had not made final decisions on what more weapons to provide Ukraine. Allied war planners are working to assess the Ukrainian requirements in both the near term — to hold off the coming Russian offensive — and over the longer term, since the war is likely to grind on for months or years.\n\nThe question is complicated. The most useful weapons are those that the Ukrainian military already knows how to employ effectively. The next best thing would be to find other weapons, the diplomat said, that the Ukrainians can be quickly trained to use.\n\nAllied nations are ramping up training efforts in neighboring countries. European officials said it could make sense to provide weapons that require a training period of weeks, instead of days, as long as those weapons would make a difference on the battlefield.\n\nThe next few weeks are likely to prove to be a critical time in the war. European intelligence officials have said Mr. Putin [is likely to try to achieve battlefield gains by May 9,](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/us/politics/russia-military-ukraine-war.html) when he is set to give a Victory Day speech to the Russian public, this year commemorating both the Soviet victory in World War II and the military operation in Ukraine.\n\nAlexander Vindman, a retired Army Lt. Colonel and an expert on Ukraine, said the Ukrainians need more warplanes. About 70 percent of the Ukrainian air force is still operating, but the military command in Kyiv has been hesitant to use their hard-to-replace fighter planes for fear that they will be shot down.\n\nIn addition, Ukraine needs its ammunition stocks replenished and artillery systems to replace those destroyed by Russian attacks, he said. Small, medium-range armed drones could also prove critical. Such systems could be used to render Russian runways inoperable.\n\n“That is a critical gap, the ability to strike deeper targets,” said Colonel Vindman, who was the chief witness against President Donald J. Trump in his first impeachment proceedings. “The Russians have the advantage of air power. They have the advantage in long-range artillery. They have the advantage in short-range ballistic missiles. In order to level the playing field, we need to transfer more.”",

    "selftext": "[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/world/asia/russia-putin-propaganda-media.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/20/world/asia/russia-putin-propaganda-media.html)\n\nMarch 20, 2022, 5:00 a.m. ET\n\nIn the tense weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Russian officials denied that it planned anything of the sort, denouncing the United States and its NATO allies for stoking panic and anti-Russian hatred. When it did invade, the officials denied it was at war.\n\nSince then, the Kremlin has cycled through a torrent of lies to explain why it had to wage a “special military operation” against a sovereign neighbor. Drug-addled neo-Nazis. Genocide. American biological weapons factories. Birds and reptiles trained to carry pathogens into Russia. Ukrainian forces bombing their own cities, including theaters sheltering children.\n\nDisinformation in wartime is as old as war itself, but today war unfolds in the age of social media and digital diplomacy. That has given Russia — and its allies in China and elsewhere — powerful means to prop up the claim that the invasion is justified, exploiting disinformation to rally its citizens at home and to discredit its enemies abroad. Truth has simply become another front in Russia’s war.\n\nUsing a barrage of increasingly outlandish falsehoods, President Vladimir V. Putin has created an alternative reality, one in which Russia is at war not with Ukraine but with a larger, more pernicious enemy in the West. Even since the war began, the lies have gotten more and more bizarre, transforming from claims that “true sovereignty” for Ukraine was possible only under Russia, made before the attacks, to those about migratory birds carrying bioweapons.\n\nRussia’s message has proved successful domestically, where the Kremlin’s claims go unchallenged. Surveys suggest a majority of Russians support the war effort. Internationally, the campaign has seeped into an information ecosystem that allows them to spread virulently, reaching audiences that were once harder to reach.\n\n“Previously, if you were sitting in Moscow and you wanted to reach audiences sitting in, say, Idaho, you would have to work really hard doing that,” said Elise Thomas, a researcher in Australia for the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, referring to disinformation campaigns dating to the Soviet Union. “It would take you time to set up the systems, whereas now you can do it with the press of a button.”\n\nThe power of Russia’s claim that the invasion is justified comes not from the veracity of any individual falsehood meant to support it but from the broader argument. Individual lies about bioweapons labs or crisis actors are advanced by Russia as swiftly as they are debunked, with little consistency or logic between them. But supporters stubbornly cling to the overarching belief that something is wrong in Ukraine and Russia will fix it. Those connections prove harder to shake, even as new evidence is introduced.\n\nThat mythology, and its resilience in the face of fact-checking and criticism, reflects “the ability of autocrats and malign actors to completely brainwash us to the point where we don’t see what’s in front of us,” said Laura Thornton, the director and senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund’s Alliance for Securing Democracy.\n\nThe Kremlin’s narratives today feed on pre-existing views of the war’s root causes, which Mr. Putin has nurtured for years — and restated in increasingly strident language last week.\n\nThe strategy to deceive, or at least confuse, international observers was used after the bombing of a maternity ward in Mariupol on March 9.\n\nThe day after the bombardment, official Russian accounts falsely claimed that a pregnant woman seen in photos from Mariupol had faked her injuries.\n\nThe story appeared on the official accounts of more than a dozen Russian embassies, according to data collected by FakeReporter, an Israeli group that studies disinformation, and ricocheted across Twitter, Facebook and Telegram.\n\nMany of the posts used the exact same media and similar language, suggesting a coordinated campaign.\n\nTwitter and Facebook eventually removed the posts, but gruesome photographs, stamped “Fake,” continued circulating across the internet, including on the chat app Telegram.\n\nAnother meme gained even more traction, relying on a yearslong campaign in Russia to stoke unfounded fears that the United States was manufacturing biological weapons in Ukraine.\n\nThe claim gained ground in English-language social media just two days into the invasion after a Twitter post by the account WarClandestine went viral. Until the account was suspended, it peddled QAnon conspiracy theories about secretive government plots. These theories fester and then seep into the mainstream.\n\nBy early March, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed it had uncovered “traces of a military biological program” in Ukraine, which it said was “financed by the U.S. Defense Ministry.”\n\nThe Fox News host Tucker Carlson soon floated the idea on his show, airing Russia’s statement and dismissing the explanation from United States officials that they were diagnostic and biodefense laboratories used for research, saying, “Whether you call them weapons or not is completely irrelevant, because they can be used as weapons.”\n\nMr. Carlson’s commentaries were then picked up in Russian media, including in a Telegram post by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti that received over one million views.\n\nChina’s government and state media parroted the claim too, in what was clearly an effort to discredit the American government’s frequent criticism of China’s behavior.\n\nNotes: The tweet from WarClandestine is presented in two parts. Posts from Telegram were translated into English.\n\nWhen Russia took such claims to an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, however, it faced withering criticism. “Russia has today brought into the Security Council a series of wild, completely baseless and irresponsible conspiracy theories,” the British representative, Barbara Woodward, told the Council. “Let me put it diplomatically: They are utter nonsense.”\n\nUkraine is waging an information campaign of its own, aiming to discredit Russia, exaggerate its own military successes and minimize its losses. It has also circulated false reports of heroism, including the martyrdom of soldiers defending an island in the Black Sea and the exploits of an ace fighter pilot in the skies over Kyiv.\n\nBy most accounts, Ukraine has so far been winning the information war, led by a powerful social media operation that flooded the internet with its own jumble of anecdotes and myths, bolstering morale among Ukrainians and uniting the Western world behind its cause.  The most central figure in their campaign has been President Volodymyr Zelensky himself, whose video messages to Ukrainians and the world have combined bravery with the stage presence of the television performer he once was.\n\nRussia, though, has more tools and reach, and it has the upper hand with weaponry. The strategy has been to overwhelm the information space, especially at home, which “is really where their focus is,” said Peter Pomerantsev, a scholar at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University who has written extensively about Russian propaganda.\n\nRussia’s propaganda machine plays into suspicion of the West and NATO, which have been vilified on state television for years, deeply embedding distrust in Russian society. State media has also more recently echoed beliefs advanced by the QAnon movement, which ascribes the world’s problems largely to global elites and sex traffickers.\n\nThose beliefs make people feel “scared and uncertain and alienated,” said Sophia Moskalenko, a social psychologist at Georgia State University. “As a result of manipulating their emotions, they will be more likely to embrace conspiracy theories.”\n\nMariupol is still suffering. Russian forces continued to bombard the besieged coastal city, hitting a drama school where 400 people were hiding, according to local officials. The city’s mayor said thousands of residents had been forcibly deported to Russia.\n\nA Ukrainian base is hit. A missile attack on barracks in the southern city of Mykolaiv killed more than 40 marines, a Ukrainian official said. That would make it one of the single deadliest attacks on Ukrainian forces since the start of the war, and the death toll could be much higher than reported.\n\nChernobyl workers are relieved. After more than three weeks without being able to leave the nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine, 64 workers were able to be rotated out, officials said. Staff at the plant have been trapped since Feb. 23, a day before Russian forces took control of the site.\n\nMr. Putin’s public remarks, which dominate state media, have become increasingly strident. He has warned that nationalist sentiment in Ukraine is a threat to Russia itself, as is NATO expansion.\n\nYet when the invasion began, it seemed to catch the organs of the propaganda apparatus unprepared. Officials and state media had just spent weeks accusing the Biden administration of exaggerating what Russia claimed were simply regular military exercises, not the buildup of an invasion force.\n\n“Clearly, they did not prepare the information warfare machine,” Mr. Pomerantsev said. “It takes months to prepare something like this.”\n\nThat could explain the changing, disjointed nature of Russia’s campaign. The threat of biological weapons in Ukraine — let alone secret American weapons factories producing them there — was not cited as a rationale for the “special military operation” that Mr. Putin announced at dawn on Feb. 24. These falsehoods emerged only later.\n\n“They throw stuff out and they see what works,” said Ms. Thomas, the researcher from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “And what’s really working for them at the moment is the biolabs stuff.”\n\nThe Kremlin’s campaign has gone beyond simply propagating its message. It has moved swiftly to silence dissenting points of view that could cut through the fog of war and discourage the Russian population.\n\nFor now, the campaign appears to have rallied public opinion behind Mr. Putin, according to most surveys in Russia, though not as high as might be expected for a country at war.\n\n“My impression is that many people in Russia are buying the government’s narrative,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “They have doctored images on state-controlled media. Private media don’t cover the war, fearing 15 years in prison. Same goes for people on the social media. Russia has lost information warfare globally, but the regime is quite successful at home.”\n\nThe question is for how long.\n\nCracks have appeared in the information fortress the Kremlin is building.\n\nA week after the invasion began, when it was already clear the war was going badly for Russian troops, Mr. Putin rushed to enact a law that punishes “fake news” with up to 15 years in prison. Media regulators warned broadcasters not to refer to the war as a war. They also forced off the air two flagships of independent media — Ekho Moskvy, a liberal radio station, and Dozhd, a television station — that gave voice to the Kremlin’s opponents.\n\nAccess to Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and most recently Instagram has also been severed inside Russia — all platforms the country’s diplomats have continued to use outside to misinform. Once spread, disinformation can be tenacious, even in places with a free press and open debate, like the United States, where polls suggest that more than 40 percent of the population believes the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald J. Trump.\n\n“Why are people so surprised that this kind of widespread disinformation can be so effective in Russia when it was so effective here?” Ms. Thornton of the German Marshall Fund said.\n\nAs the war in Ukraine drags on, however, casualties are mounting, confronting families in Russia with the loss of fathers and sons. That could test how persuasive the Kremlin’s information campaign truly is.\n\nThe Soviet Union sought to keep a similar veil of silence around its decade-long quagmire in Afghanistan in the 1980s, but the truth seeped into public consciousness anyway, eroding the foundation of the entire system. Two years after the last troops pulled out in 1989, the Soviet Union itself collapsed.",

    "selftext": "I wanted to make a quick post detailing a form of manipulation that certain people in the media will partake in in order to share their agenda. This is not meant to be a call-out post, me trying to cancel them, or me saying that I am right. What this is doing is simply showing why you should be trying to get information from as varying places as possible. This is also going to be American centered because I'm American, but it can extend to anyone from any country covering any topic.   \n\n\nThe example I want to use is that of former VICE reporter turned Youtube political commentator, Tim Pool. Pool may be \"just a Youtuber\" but he's been prolific enough to have the likes of Steve Bannon, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, Col. Allen West, and MTG on his show. Believe what you about these guests, I do not care, what I'm trying to say is that he does have influence.   \n\n\nOver the last three weeks, Tim Pool has been lightly covering the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in a somewhat neutral fashion. He does not appear to be in favor of Russia's invasion, but at the same time he condemns any attempt to show support for Ukraine in its defense. On his channels, he has repeatedly alluded to the fact that Russia is really winning the war in Ukraine and that **ALL** information that counters that narrative is propaganda. He has accused President Zelensky of being a Communist, claimed that the Ukrainians are fighting for globalists forces trying to enact the \"Great Reset\", and has now claimed that this war is being supported by the US because President Biden is trying to cover up his son's dirty laundry.   \n\n\nThis is all stupid enough, but what makes this dangerous is that nothing he has said is technically false information, rather it is telling pointless truths in order to push an agenda. For example, Tim Pool did not say that Zelensky **IS** a communist, rather he said that he \"gave a communist salute\" to the UN. He did not claim that the Ukraine **IS** fighting for the \"Great Reset\", but rather it has been \"raising theories about the Great Reset\".    \n\n\nThis kind of information sharing is dangerous because it allows the speaker to spread propaganda and masquerading it as truth. My main point is, if you see someone making claims like this, please take the time to research what it is that they are talking about. It may be a dry and boring process, but it is important for you to remain properly informed. Try to understand the context behind certain statements being made online or in the media. Believe it or not, this is not a partisan issue, nearly every major problem that arises in our political discourse will have people on either side of the isle attempting to throw out a smokescreen to protect \"their side\". It is best to avoid that.   \n\n\n*Disclosure of my own Biases: I feel the need to disclose my own biases here at the end because, people may accuse me of being partisan or bias in my analysis of this situation. I am a socially liberal, economically conservative, centrist. I'm not actively involved in domestic politics as it does not interest me. My first-time voting was in 2016, I voted for Bernie and then did not vote for either Trump or Clinton, in 2020, I campaigned for Yang, voted for Bernie in the primary, and then voted for Trump. I have always been 100% in favor of Ukraine over Russia, even going back to 2013-14 with the annexation of Crimea and the breakaway regions in the East. My only loyalty is to honesty and truth, something that people, from across the political spectrum should be able to agree on, but we rarely even discuss anymore.*",

Hes making fun of Putin calling them  “peace keeping forces” and says too bad we can’t have “peace keeping forces” to protect the southern border You didn’t listen to the entire interview. Here’s the transcript which even says (sarcastic). \n\nClay and buck radio interview Trump \n\nThis is a disaster what’s going on, whether it’s Ukraine or the Afghanistan pullout, which I think is the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\nI think that has a lot to do with what’s going on in Ukraine…\nI went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, “This is genius.” Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful. (sarcastic)\nSo, Putin is now saying, “It’s independent,” a large section of Ukraine. I said, “How smart is that?” And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.\nBy the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here’s a guy that says, you know, “I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,” he used the word “independent,” “and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.” You gotta say that’s pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn’t have one for that. No, it’s very sad. Very sad…\n\nI think he (Putin) sees this opportunity. I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it. I said, “You can’t do it. You’re not gonna do it.” But I could see that he wanted it. I used to ask him. We used to talk about it at length. I think nobody probably knows him better in terms of the discussions that we have or that we’re having this morning. So, I knew him very well. I got to know him. I got to know President Xi. By the way, China is gonna be next. You know, China is gonna —\nCLAY: You think they’re gonna go after Taiwan?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, absolutely. Not with me, they wouldn’t have.\nCLAY: But you think with Biden they’ll try him?\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, yeah. They’re waiting ’til after the Olympics. Now the Olympics ended, and look at your stopwatch, right? No, he wants that just like… It’s almost like twin sisters right here because you have one that wants Taiwan, I think, equally badly. Somebody said, “Who wants it more?” I think probably equally badly. But, no, Putin would have never done it, and Xi would have never done it. And also, North Korea has not acted up for four years.\n\nHere’s Trump’s speech a few days later:\n\nJoe Biden has turned calm into chaos, competence into incompetence, stability into anarchy, and security into catastrophe.\nThe Russian attack on Ukraine is appalling; it's an outrage and an atrocity that should never have been allowed to occur, it never would have occurred.\n\nWe are praying for the proud people of Ukraine. God bless them all.\n\nReporters asked me if I thought President Putin was smart; I said, 'Of course, he's smart – to which I was greeted with, 'ah, that's such a terrible thing to say.'\n\n'If you take over Ukraine, we're going to sanction you,’ They say. SANCTION? Well, that's a pretty weak statement. Putin is saying, 'oh, they're going to sanction me; they sanctioned me for the last 25 years – you mean I can take over all the country, and they're gonna sanction me. You mean they're not going to blow us to pieces?'\nThe problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course he is, but that our leaders are dumb — they so far allowed him to get away with this travesty and assault on humanity.\nPutin is playing Biden like a drum, and it is not a pretty thing to watch, and it would have been so easy for me to stop this travesty from happening.",

    "selftext": "February 27, 2022 (Sunday)\n \nSouthern novelist William Faulkner’s famous line saying “The past is never dead. It’s not even past,” is usually interpreted as a reflection on how the evils of our history continue to shape the present. But Faulkner also argued, equally accurately, that the past is “not even past” because what happens in the present changes the way we remember the past.\n \nRussia’s attack on Ukraine and the defiant and heroic response of the people of Ukraine to that new invasion are changing the way we remember the past.\n \nLess than a week ago, Russian president Vladimir Putin launched an assault on Ukraine, and with his large military force, rebuilt after the military’s poor showing in its 2008 invasion of Georgia, it seemed to most observers that such an attack would be quick and deadly. He seemed unstoppable. For all that his position at home has been weakening for a while now as a slow economy and the political opposition of people like Alexei Navalny have turned people against him, his global influence seemed to be growing. That he believed an attack on Ukraine would be quick and successful was clear today when a number of Russian state media outlets published an essay, obviously written before the invasion, announcing Russia’s victory in Ukraine, saying ominously that “Putin solved the Ukrainian question forever…. Ukraine has returned to Russia.” \n \nBut Ukrainians changed the story line. While the war is still underway and deadly, and while Russia continues to escalate its attacks, no matter what happens the world will never go back to where it was a week ago. Suddenly, autocracy, rather than democracy, appears to be on the ropes.\n \nIn that new story, countries are organizing against Putin’s aggression and the authoritarianism behind it. Leaders of the world’s major economies, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Singapore, though not China, are working together to deny Putin’s access to the world’s financial markets.\n\nAs countries work together, international sanctions appear to be having an effect: a Russian bank this morning offered to exchange rubles for dollars at a rate of 171:1. Before the announcement that Europe and the U.S. would target Russia’s central bank, the rate was 83:1. Monday morning, Moscow time, the ruble plunged 30%. As Russia’s economy descends into chaos, investors are jumping out: today BP, Russia’s largest foreign investor, announced it is abandoning its investment in the Russian oil company Rosneft and pulling out of the country, at a loss of what is estimated to be about $25 billion.\n\nThe European Union has suddenly taken on a large military role in the world, announcing it would supply fighter jets to Ukraine. Sweden, which is a member of the E.U., will also send military aid to Ukraine. And German chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Germany, which has tended to underfund its military, would commit 100 billion euros, which is about $112.7 billion, to support its armed forces. The E.U. has also prohibited all Russian planes from its airspace, including Russian-chartered private jets.\n\nMichael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted: “Russian elites fear Putin. But they no longer respect him. He has ruined their lives—damaged their fortunes, damaged the future of their kids, and may now have turned society away from them. They were living just fine until a week ago. Now, their lives will never be the same.”\n\nGlobal power is different this week than last. Anti-authoritarian nations are pushing back on Russia and the techniques Putin has used to gain outsized influence. Today the E.U. banned media outlets operated by the Russian state. The White House and our allies also announced a new “transatlantic task force that will identify and freeze the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies—Russian officials and elites close to the Russian government, as well as their families, and their enablers.” \n\nThat word “enablers” seems an important one, for since 2016 there have been plenty of apologists for Putin here in the U.S. And yet now, with the weight of popular opinion shifting toward a defense of democracy, Republicans who previously cozied up to Putin are suddenly stating their support for Ukraine and trying to suggest that Putin has gotten out of line only because he sees Biden as weak. Under Trump, they say, Putin never would have invaded Ukraine, and they are praising Trump for providing aid to Ukraine in 2019.\n \nThey are hoping that their present support for Ukraine and democracy makes us forget their past support for Putin, even as former president Trump continues to call him “smart.” And yet, Republicans changed their party’s 2016 platform to favor Russia over Ukraine; accepted Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria in October 2019, giving Russia a strategic foothold in the Middle East; and looked the other way when Trump withheld $391 million to help Ukraine resist Russian invasion until newly elected Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to help rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. (Trump did release the money after the story of the “perfect phone call” came out, but the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which investigated the withholding of funds, concluded that holding back the money at all was illegal.)\n\nBut rather than making us forget Republicans’ enabling of Putin’s expansion, the new story in which democracy has the upper hand might have the opposite effect. Now that people can clearly see exactly the man Republicans have supported, they will want to know why our leaders, who have taken an oath to our democratic Constitution, were willing to throw in their lot with a foreign autocrat. The answer to that question might well force us to rethink a lot of what we thought we knew about the last several years.\n\nIn today’s America, the past certainly is not past.",

We don't know how good his promises are but that's something he did say at least. \n\nHe wants to create some 'inquisition' council to route corruption. The problem is he also wants it to be able to go after anyone and so it means he'd have to put it 'above' the law which I don't think he's really thought through what happens if the people on his own council are corrupt themselves. Hopefully this is more thought out if he moves in this direction or he'd just create a state sanctioned witch hunt that will ultimately work against him\n\nHe's for Euro 'free movement' which is a pro for the average Ukrainian but at the same time the country could suffer a brain bleed if he doesn't promote industry or projects to keep the top Ukrainian minds from fleeing the country. \n\nHe has not formally said if he's for or against NATO or EU adoption but I don't think if he was against it he would make it directly known because it would put him at big odds with the majority of the country at this point. However he has made no intentions of further international treaties or interests known.\n\nHe has no plans regarding the current rate of the UAH against the EURO or any plans to increase it's value so it's competitive enough to even be considered for EU membership. Also how to do it without further crippling the living value of the 30% population that are soviet pensioners. That's a lot of people to make homeless just to join the EU.\n\nHe has not said his opinion or if he would remain party to the minsk agreement or his ideas surround defense spending. If he were to back out of Minsk without a plan it would just invite Russia to push for a land bridge again which would also lock off the  Kerch Strait which at the moment might me an ideal solution for Russia.",
