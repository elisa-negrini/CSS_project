The U.S. is the world's top producer of oil and gas, a position Wright said means the U.S. can take action that was previously unthinkable.
""We're able to do things that we couldn't do before,"" he said.
Despite that position, the Trump administration has not yet put major oil sanctions on Russia, preferring to impose them on OPEC producer Iran since the president took office for a second time in January

Responding to President Trump’s ultimatum to Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin that he “accept a peace deal with Ukraine within 50 days or face new secondary sanctions,” Rice said, “I think the best news that we could possibly give to the Ukrainian people is that the United States and Europe have finally aligned around the idea that Vladimir Putin will not be stopped with words. He will only be stopped if he believes that he can go no further, he can win no further.” Rice suggested that American and European alignment on handling Russia marks a “turning point” in the Ukraine conflict, raising the prospect of additional weapons deliveries and support for the embattled nation. Rice also discussed the possible challenges of enforcing secondary sanctions on entities doing business with Russia, and shared her view on why it’s not a bad thing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is jointly serving as National Security Advisor. ",2025-07-21T21:12:00

&gt;U.S. President Donald Trump [announced](https://kyivindependent.com/us-conducts-air-strikes-on-iranian-nuclear-sites-trump-says/) on June 21 that the U.S. air strikes targeted three nuclear sites in [Iran](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/iran), Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan, joining [Israel](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/israel/)'s campaign against Iran's nuclear program amid the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

&gt;""The irresponsible decision to subject the territory of a sovereign state to missile and bomb strikes, no matter what arguments are used, is grossly violating international law, the U.N. Charter, and the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council,"" the [Russian](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/) Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

&gt;The ministry also warned of possible radiological consequences, despite Moscow's own [record](https://kyivindependent.com/months-after-bombing-chornobyl-russia-warns-israeli-strikes-on-iran-risk-nuclear-catastrophe/) of repeatedly placing nuclear facilities at risk during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and threatening to use nuclear weapons.

&gt;Russia and Iran are close strategic partners, with Tehran providing Moscow with ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed attack drones for its war against Ukraine.

&gt;Moscow has diplomatically backed Iran after Israel launched the initial air strikes against Iranian military and nuclear targets on June 13, an operation that sparked further waves of aerial attacks from both sides.",2025-06-23T05:35:12

Look, at the end of the day, if Iran is committed to becoming a nuclear weapons power, it puts the regime at risk. 

It would be the end of the regime if they tried to do that.

Putin sure is taking Trump’s suggestion to heart, right? Maybe he just has to keep bombing the Ukrainian cities now that Trump told him to. First Trump said that Putin only wanted peace while the Ukrainians started the war. After Putin had said that. Then he said Zelensky was a dictator. After Putin had said that. And now Trump suggests that Putin should go for war instead of peace. After Putin made it clear once again he was doing that.

Maybe Trump is trying to at least keep convincing the 48% of the Americans that are happy with his politics, that Putin just is following the suggestions of the Americans when he takes as much of Ukraine as possible and avoids peace. Then they can feel better when watching the news reports from Ukraine, and think that it at least is with the support from America these things happen, and not something that goes against the Strong President’s wishes.

Maybe the 49% that do not support Trump might consider that he as soon as Putin does or says something is quick to express support for it. Putin says he wants peace discussions with Zelensky. When Zelensky turns up Putin refuses. Trump quickly says that he told Putin he has to keep fighting instead, and has ”excellent” discussions with Putin about him having to respond forcefully to the Ukrainians…",2025-06-09T15:23:33

1kwz9yn,Russian bots turn on ‘clown’ Donald Trump after he rips Putin over war in Ukraine,theindependentonline,264,2025-05-27T21:22:52,Choice-of-SteinsGate,14,"Trump is having to come to terms with reality after glorifying and defending Putin for years; desperately hoping for his cooperation in return.

But because Trump now recognizes that brokering a peace will be far more complicated and difficult than he previously imagined, he's become outraged over the fact that he won't be handed a ""win"" and entitled to some kind of accolade for his feckless efforts.

Make no mistake, Trump cares far more about being awarded for his efforts than he does about actually ending the war.

That said, Trump promised to end the war on ""day one,"" but during his first call with Putin, they chatted about their ""shared history"" and discussed how Trump could help Putin realize his goals and assist Russia in seizing control of a large chunk of Ukrainian land.

Immediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a ""dictator""

Trump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies publicly denigrated Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership for weeks, and without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.

In fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.

Trump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to ""negotiate"" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.

Trump had the gall to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.

The truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.

Every ""deal"" he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.

He even previously called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius"" and ""savvy."" 

Trump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO. This move would only weaken the alliance; effectively carrying out one of Putin's most ambitious goals for him.

Trump has practically enabled Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.

Trump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.

Trump has defended Putin for years, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a ""killer"" who murders his political opponents.

During his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over abandoned US military outposts.

Trump ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald ""bone spurs"" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed these forces to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.

And let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after he demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are crucial for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.

And look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been Putin's personal backscratcher and useful idiot for years, but what's really irritating right now is how Trump cares very little about the war and its ramifications, and is far more concerned about how he can take credit for negotiating a lukewarm deal at best.

He's desperate to be awarded the title of ""peacemaker,"" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, straining our alliances, and offering up Ukraine's territory to Russia with no real security guarantees in return.

He'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.

Putin is a dangerous expansionist on a warpath to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.

Trump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, only to later resume a freshly organized and newly equipped ""special military operation"" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.

Putin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.

For Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, half-hearted and temporary deal is made.",2025-05-27T21:50:57

Putin improved average QOL for Russia by a very large amount - especially during his first term. Its one of the reasons he is so immensely popular in Russia. 

He also doesn't need to buy the support of oligarchs because he can literally kill them whenever he chooses to. That's not to say that the war hasn't been helpful to him - it has, since it put many oligarchs into a position where they can no longer choose between the West and Russia. They can no longer stash their assets in the West, so they have no choice but to bend over to Putin even harder.

Last but not least, Russia didn't want either the war in Syria or the war in Ukraine (back in 2014) - they were woefully unprepared for either one, and reacted to unfolding events, rather than orchestrating them.

You have one thing right though, when this war in Ukraine ends it will be the last war for Putin. He is tired and he is old, and he is going to retire sooner rather than later. The real problem is that Putin is Russia's centrist. Its unclear whether he will be replaced by someone who is further right than he is.",2025-05-26T00:27:20

Brink said it was all about the Trump administration’s tactics in trying to end the three-year-old war.

*“Unfortunately, the policy since the beginning of the Trump administration has been to put pressure on the victim, Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia,”* she wrote in the op-ed.

It's also entirely understandable that someone, or often rather something more powerful, like a board, able to give orders to someone with power, be equally able to expect their agenda carried out.

Trump is in the Russian camp - he isn't served well with a diplomat that is in the Ukranian camp. Furthermore, all three countries end up with unclear and unstable policy, without the foundational support that comes from executives being on the same page and in agreement.

I'm not saying it's good that people quit - but I understand it. Anyone in the federal government opposed to the Trumpian agenda will end up rooted out eventually - those more effective holding him up will be simlly go faster.

This is obviously not exclusively in federal government, tho. This is a massive overstep Diplomatically, but especially considering the CEO he just ousted, even if its Paramount and CBS technically doing everything - its a very fascist step.

Pretty clear the rich people behind everything are still for whatever makes them the most money above all other things - even keeping their orange goose laying 6 trillion dollar eggs. Ukraine and Nato and Euros be d4mned I guess.

1kp2nfs,Trump says he will call Putin to discuss stopping Ukraine war,HotHuckleberry8904,35,2025-05-17T20:35:32,Choice-of-SteinsGate,3,"One of the last times he called Putin, they chatted about their ""shared history"" and discussed how Trump could help Russia seize control of one-fifth of Ukraine's land. 

Immediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a ""dictator""

Trump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies went on for weeks denigrating Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.

In fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.

Trump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to ""negotiate"" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.

Trump had the gall to call Zelensky a ""dictator without elections,"" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.

The truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.

Every ""deal* he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.

He even called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius"" and ""savvy."" 

Trump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely. And if you're not aware, weakening NATO is one of Putin's most ambitious goals. 

Trump has practically glorified Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.

Trump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.

Trump has defended Putin throughout his presidency, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a ""killer"" who murders his political opponents.

During his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over US military outposts that Trump had abandoned.

Trump also effectively ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald ""bone spurs"" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed them to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.

And let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after Trump demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are a crucial supply for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.

And look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been a long-standing ally and useful idiot to Putin, but what's especially concerning right now is how Trump cares next to nothing about ""ending the war"" in Ukraine, and cares far more about getting the credit for it.

He wants nothing more than to be awarded the title of ""peacemaker,"" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, weakening our alliances, and offering up a large chunk of Ukraine's territory to Russia with no specific security guarantees in return.

He'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.

Putin is a dangerous expansionist on a campaign to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.

Trump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, all so he can later resume a freshly organized and equipped ""special military operation"" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.

Putin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.

For Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",2025-05-17T23:14:46

It's so bad that it's hard not to believe Russia doesn't either have something on them or are giving something to them.

Not only did everyone tell them play-by-play exactly what Russia was doing but had they been paying attention they would've seen it unfold in real time over the past several years. That's ignoring their actions in Ukraine a decade ago and Russia's typical actions throughout history.

I get that most voters just see that Biden is old and it kills the vibes or whatever, but he often made the right moves with policy. But at the end of the day politics is all messaging and you can't argue with  Biden's rapid decline in that regard. It is a double standard though, since Trump has a 100 word vocabulary and says crazy shit every single time he speaks, but he seems to dodge mainstream criticism for that.

Blaming it on anything else is feeding right into his hands.

“Putin doesn't believe Ukraine is a real country.”

By that he means a homogenous state with a single identity, he made that known back in 2008 ‘Ukraine is not even a state! What is Ukraine? A part of its territory is in Eastern Europe, but another part, a considerable one, was a gift from us!” Here he’s referring to the Southeastern parts where the conflict is raging that have more Russian speakers/ethnic Russians.

Which in the early 1920s Lenin arbitrarily allocated those lands from
Russia to Ukraine, Putin spoke about this in 2018 and how it planted a time bomb in the Soviet state and laid the foundation for the ongoing crisis.

https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/vladimirputindonbassandukraine.htm

Western media likes to interpret things like this in a narrow-minded way to fit their narrative/agenda, admittedly he probably should’ve made it more clear that he meant Ukraine as a state with a unified national identity.

“He invaded because he wants his legacy to be a restoration of the former Russian Empire.”

Please provide the quote where he says he wants his legacy to be the restoration of the Russian Empire.


“Blaming it on anything else is feeding right into his hands.”

By ignoring the contents of the text of the cable I quoted in my original comment you’re excusing the role played by the West in fueling this crisis. You’re also deliberately trying to narrow the conversation because you seemingly don’t want to entertain an opposing point of view.

      - His nuclear shield doesn't hurt, either. I'm pretty sure if someone assassinated him a nuke would automatically launch.
      - I would not be surprised the whole Ukraine invasion and throwing all those lives away was a targeted attack against the US economy and political system, or possibly something else entirely, and possibly getting Ukraine is the cheese on the pie.
   - Putin is a master at tactics, strategy, and has a historical perspective. He plays a very long game just as well as he plays short.
      - I'm not sure _why_ he's invaded Ukraine, but I am pretty sure it wasn't for the obvious reason and I'm pretty sure he's getting a lot of what he wants... whatever that is.

Trump: It is impossible to underestimate this creepy fuck.
   - linear checkers? 1d chicken? He'd play both, cheat, and lose. Dude, this guy would cheat on his own mushroom dick if he could figure out what a good par for the course was.
   - He's cunning, greedy, and needs external validation. He _thinks_ he's ruthless, but he's petty and cruel.

How the fuck does Witkoff not know who the interpreter is going into a meeting with Putin to discuss a peace settlement? It is a higher likelihood that the interpreter is not from the embassy and is provided by Putin, and they can just make shit up and Witkoff will be none the wiser.

Apparently it's surprising to trump. Goodness, I wonder why they hate each other?

&gt;“You don’t know what pressure I’m putting on Russia,” Trump snapped. “We’re putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and Russia knows that.”

Yes, the ""Vladimir, STOP!"" tweet is so much pressure.

&gt;After Trump insisted earlier in the day that Putin still wanted to reach peace, Rutte sounded decidedly less certain.

We’re trying to sleep, but my daughter and I are dressed and staying in the hallway, with our emergency backpack by the door — water and documents inside. In a district far from us, a 3-year-old child was injured… People are trapped under rubble… There’s no end to this suffering”. 

She shared with me, her location and her cell number which I didn’t actually have at the time. I think she wanted someone from the outside to know where she was.   She’s never showed that information with me before so I knew it was bad last night.

but I'll go into detail since you don't think its obvious enough. Russia has a population many times higher, and can go for way longer. Russia also has weaponry superiority. although Ukraine has brave and and capable soldiers that won't go forever, we already have Ukrainians being kidnapped and forced to join the war, they lack the manpower. it is a race against time and the more time passes the more territory Ukraine will and is already losing. Ukraine right now is like a hospitalized patient that is still alive because there are machines hooked to them (the us). the only reason Ukraine has not been totally occupied is because of the external help.

that external help is going away, the USA doesn't want to keep funding Ukraine, so time is of the essence for Ukraine and why a peace deal is the way to go. this is without mentioning the most important thing, the killing stops.",2025-04-24T22:26:09

But a peace deal on its own, at least ones that are being discussed are not likely to be accepted or pan out. The way I see it here are my thoughts on the matter. 

Peace deal, current territorial gains kept, no additional arms or security guarantee: This gives both sides time to recover and re-arm. This does however greatly favour Russia as while their quality of arms may not be equal to the quality that Ukraine has been getting, even with Europe still supplying Ukraine though not as a whole bloc, Russia will likely still have the industry to re-arm at a faster rate especially if they continue receiving arms from China and North Korea. In addition to this, Putin has repeatedly shown that he is willing to ignore agreed upon treaties such as the Minsk agreement by using a combination of propaganda, misinformation and false flag operations. See, literally any other conflict Russia has started since the cold war. Even if US companies set up mining operations they will likely completely bypass these areas or again use false flags and blame Ukraine for any damage/casualties. 

Any other peace deal: Russia will never accept a deal which provides Ukraine with security guarantees from the EU/NATO/US. Nor will either side likely accept loss of territory. 

My opinion on the best option: Personally, and I should note I have 0 background in economics or geopolitics, I think the best path to peace is further sanctioning Russia and implementing Tariffs (I know, I know) or sanctions on nations supporting or bypassing sanctions on Russia. This would be done over time to give time to the nations to find other sources for supply like oil. 

Negotiate with nations to further undercut Russian prices on resources like oil and gas prior to the above. Lastly, arm Ukraine to the teeth, Supply then with modern arms without restrictions. Russia has stated previously that redlines would lead to military actions on these countries who supplied arms such as f16s, tracks, etc but these have always resulted in nothing. As a safety barrier this can also be done incrementally though it must be at a much faster pace than it is currently. Especially for European nations as it is in their great interest as Russia has historically always been the biggest threat and continues to be. It should also be noted that this can have positive effects for these nations as they get better data on their arms usefulness as well as boosts their economy in the replacement and improvements on these arms. 

Again I am no expert, these are my own thoughts and should not be taken at face value. I am not your general and this is not military advice 😅.

*You* are ignoring the fact that giving in to Putin's demands, or 'agreeing to a peace deal now', means that 2 million more homes need to be surrendered to Russia and Ukraine needs to destroy its own military and can't accept any military aid, because *that* are Putin's demands. Obviously, this would make it very easy for Putin to invade again a few years later (or perhaps even a few weeks), destroy more and take more.

You are also ignoring the fact that Russia has held Ukraine for centuries as a colony, and attempted to gradually genocide it away in the process of Russification in order to keep the land, through things like the Holodomor and deportations and by forbidding the Ukrainian language and culture.

The Ukrainian language is now forbidden again in the occupied territories, people and children are being deported to Russia proper, Ukrainian 18 year olds are being recruited by the Russian army to fight against Ukraine, people who resist are arrested and possibly tortured and Russians are encouraged to cheaply buy the houses left behind by refugees.

Do you not care about all of this? And do you also not care that Russia will likely just invade further if the Ukrainian government agrees to a 'peace' now?

How can you claim to argue for the Ukrainian population if you don't know or care about the genocidal acts of Russia against them?

donald is a pathetic loser who attempted a coup against the USA. he is a grifter, failed businessman and convicted criminal felon. He's trashing the country's government domestically and abroad. He has no idea the destruction he is causing with absolutely no gain for the American interests. 

why he was not disqualified to run for office is absurd however it is mind boggling that he became president again. He must be REMOVED",2025-04-25T05:45:54

He already got away with launching an insurrection once, and the other branches of government currently lack the will to really oppose him, so he doesn’t really have to worry about that right now. Or so he thinks, anyways. 

Getting re-elected after everything he’s done and consequently getting away from his convictions, scot-free, was bound to embolden a man like him.

His behavior doesn’t mean he is literally a Russian asset, per se, but it’s kinda silly to think the guy cares or is concerned about things like laws or being exposed for breaking them. It didn’t stop him from being a fraudster, criminal, and liar before he was president. I think it’s more crazy to imagine he’d just stop doing that now, of all times.

Trump's truest statement was his grab em by the pussy comments. That is how he views life, men take what they want if they are strong, and the weak should back down and let it happen. With this view, Russia took what they wanted so they didn't start the war, it was when Ukraine fought back that the war began. 

This is also why Trump doesn't understand not being able to annex Greenland, Canada or the Panama Canal. He believes the powerful have a duty to take what they want and the weak have a duty to acquiesce.

You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.”

Trump is so invested in supporting Putin that he can’t even stop talking about Zelensky having started the war when that is not the subject at hand. And that too is such a deranged idea that one wonders why so many continue to support Trump. How on earth did Zelensky start the war? By not capitulating when the Russians ”defended” themselves when entering Ukraine? And how is his trying to buy weapons since he isn’t given them something to ridicule?

1. Yuri Shvets

Former Role: KGB major, based in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s.

Claims: Trump was identified as a potential asset in the 1980s. The 1987 Moscow trip was orchestrated by the KGB. Trump’s political actions afterward (e.g. anti-NATO newspaper ads) were seen as successful influence operations by Soviet handlers.

Source: Featured heavily in Craig Unger's American Kompromat.

2. Sergei Zhirnov

Former Role: KGB officer, trained at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute, now residing in France.

Claims: Trump’s 1987 Moscow trip was a classic KGB recruitment test. Zhirnov says Trump was surveilled during the trip, and Soviet agents sought kompromat (compromising material). He strongly believes Trump was cultivated, if not formally recruited.

Medium: Frequent interviews in French and European media, including ""Opération Trump"" documentary.


3. 
Alnur Mussayev

Former Role: Head of Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee (KNB) in the 1990s.

Claims: Trump was recruited during the 1987 trip and given the codename ""Krasnov"". Mussayev also suggested this was known at the time among KGB and satellite service.

4.
Oleg Kalugin

Former Role: KGB General and head of foreign counterintelligence (until 1990).

Claims: Kalugin has not claimed direct knowledge of Trump being recruited, but he has repeatedly explained how the KGB targeted and cultivated American businessmen and politicians in long-term operations.

Context: In the 2024 French documentary Opération Trump, Kalugin discussed Soviet influence techniques and acknowledged Trump was a target, though he stopped short of confirming recruitment, but rather said that KGB had compromising material.",2025-04-16T18:36:41

The convergence of Trump’s actions with Russia’s interests is too consistent to dismiss as random. This realization carries profound implications for U.S. national security. If indeed an American president has been influenced to prioritize a foreign adversary’s agenda, it represents a historic breach in our democracy’s defenses. The checklist below summarizes how Trump’s conduct aligns with known Russian influence tactics. By comparing these side-by-side, it becomes painfully clear that Trump checks nearly every box. It is incumbent on U.S. institutions and the public to recognize these warning signs and ensure that no leader is ever again allowed to advance a hostile nation’s aims under the guise of American policy.

Trump vs. Russian Influence Checklist: (Does Donald Trump’s behavior align with classic signs of foreign influence?)

- Secret Communications with Adversary: Yes. Trump held unusual off-record meetings with Putin (no aides or notes) and had covert calls (Subpoena the Trump-Putin Helsinki Interpreter - The Atlantic) (Trump spoke with Putin multiple times since leaving office, Woodward book reports - POLITICO). Agents of influence often operate clandestinely to hide guidance from their handlers. Trump’s secrecy fits this pattern.

- Praise and Flattery Toward Adversary Leader: Yes. Despite Putin’s aggression, Trump consistently praised Putin as “smart” and “savvy”, rarely if ever criticizing him (Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters). The Kremlin cultivates ego – Trump responded with obsequious admiration, undermining U.S. moral authority.

- Echoing Adversary’s Propaganda/Narratives: Yes. Trump frequently parroted Russian talking points – blaming NATO allies, questioning Ukraine’s legitimacy, denying Russian meddling – often word-for-word what Russian media were saying (Why John Bolton Is Certain Trump Really Wants to Blow Up NATO - POLITICO) (‘Doing Our Job For Us’: Russian State Media Rejoice at Trump’s Putin Embrace - The Moscow Times). This mirrors how an influenced asset amplifies their patron’s message.

- Policy Shifts That Benefit Adversary: Yes. From halting Ukraine aid (Trump halts all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, White House official says | Reuters) to trying to weaken NATO (Why John Bolton Is Certain Trump Really Wants to Blow Up NATO - POLITICO), Trump’s major foreign policy moves have favored Russia’s strategic position. Each aligns with longstanding Kremlin objectives (e.g., dividing the West, dominating Ukraine).

- Dismissal of Own Intelligence &amp; Institutions: Yes. Trump sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence on election interference (Subpoena the Trump-Putin Helsinki Interpreter - The Atlantic), undermined the FBI/counterintelligence probe, and attacked U.S. officials who were tough on Russia. Such distrust in his own agencies serves Russia’s goal of sowing chaos in U.S. decision-making.

- Financial or Personal Vulnerabilities Exploited: Likely yes. While details are murky, Trump’s long history of business entanglements in Russia (and reliance on Russian money in his real estate empire) created clear vulnerabilities. Ex-KGB insiders assert he was “ideally recruitable” due to these greed and ego weaknesses (‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief). Kremlin influence operations habitually exploit exactly these soft spots.

- Adversary Praise and Endorsement: Yes. Russian officials and state media openly praise Trump as someone they can work with, far more than any U.S. president in memory (Russia praises Trump and scolds Europe for being the crucible of war | Reuters) (‘Doing Our Job For Us’: Russian State Media Rejoice at Trump’s Putin Embrace - The Moscow Times). Putin himself has lauded Trump’s statements as “business-like.” This positive reinforcement from the adversary is a strong sign the relationship is delivering value to them – in Putin’s case, Trump was literally “doing our job for us,” as one Russian TV host put it (‘Doing Our Job For Us’: Russian State Media Rejoice at Trump’s Putin Embrace - The Moscow Times).

- Isolation from Allied Input: Yes. Trump repeatedly ignored or belittled U.S. allies (from NATO leaders to Ukraine’s president) while engaging Putin one-on-one (Putin-Trump meeting is possible this month but may be later, Kremlin says | Reuters) (Trump halts all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, White House official says | Reuters). Cutting off allied advice while favoring the adversary’s counsel is a red flag in influence assessments. Trump’s approach left U.S. allies aghast and Moscow jubilant.

Every warning sign on this checklist applies to Donald Trump. Taken together, they reveal a deeply troubling pattern: a U.S. President whose words, deeds, and policies have aligned—again and again—with Russian interests. If every clue points in the same direction, what are we afraid to admit, or even ask? The label Manchurian Candidate may seem provocative, but history reminds us that the most dangerous betrayals are often dismissed as unthinkable—until they are not.

History may not repeat itself, but it rhymes. And in this moment, the music is deafening. The only question left is whether we will continue to hum along—or change the tune.",2025-04-14T16:27:57

They're attacking our election systems, installing cronies at the highest levels of government, deporting legal immigrants, making it harder for women to vote, making it impossible for trans people to get a passport, dismantling LGBT protections, destroying our social safety net, setting up extrajudicial death camps, crashing the economy, and destabilizing the U.S dollar. 

I don't have a car to get to protests near me, I live in a rural area so there's no public transportation, I've been without work for three months, and I think that my only real option is to leave the U.S and claim asylum in a sympathetic country before the borders are closed. 

They're already working on closing off the U.S/Mexico border. I wonder how long before they do the same to the Canadian border and then air travel? 

Also Trump is planning on invoking the Insurrection Act on April 20th. The order was signed on January 20th, you should definitely give it a read.

I now believe that supporting Ukraine is America First.  
  
Politics goes out the window when you see the atrocities at the hands of the Russians—  
that is just pure evil.  
  
I was on the ground.  
I walked through the ruins of churches,  
spoke to pastors whose congregations were scattered or killed,  
and saw the white bandanas—meant to identify civilians—  
used to tie the hands of elderly women before they were executed.  
  
I stood in a church-turned-memorial in BHA,  
where they celebrate liberation while surrounded by images of death.  
  
I heard about the 20,000 children kidnapped and deported to Russia,  
with over a million more unaccounted for.  
  
No one paid me to go to Ukraine.  
I bought my own ticket,  
and what I saw broke me.  
  
This is bigger than left or right, Republican or Democrat.  
This is about defending the innocent,  
defending faith,  
and standing up to evil.  
  
Ukraine is not just a place on a map—  
it’s people.  
And they are crying out for help.  
  
Not for money—  
but for peace,

I saw multiple signs advertising psychic readings in public. I was born last century, and until literally this year, I'd *thought* psychics as a profession had died out the century before that in the 1800s. 

I'd never seen one before so I'd just assumed that the idea of psychics existing as an actual profession in modern times was entirely made up for TV, which now that I check that is apparently deeply untrue, I mean, a [Vogue author wrote last year](https://www.vogue.com/article/why-do-people-become-addicted-to-psychics): ""**Most people I know** have at one point in their lives gone to see a psychic, astrologer, tea leaf reader, or medium.""

So if this person, in 2025, has a social network in which the majority of people have paid money to have someone make specific predictions about their futures on the basis of storytelling about chance events, I think it really only stands to reason that a President might have one too.

I think the weirder part is that he would want a pastor at all. He could have that every Sunday in a church, but he never goes there. So for Trump, the reason he picks a pastor without following through is probably because it's the easiest way to make a show of it without actually doing anything, although obviously that doesn't really address what you're saying; even if Trump's not one of them, for a lot of people in the modern world, spirituality *is* more than just for show.",2025-04-11T00:20:26

1jpu4zc,Ukraine war briefing: US anger builds on Russia over refusal to accept ceasefire,SnoozeDoggyDog,39,2025-04-02T17:18:17,cbsson,1,"Russia started and wants this war of conquest. Yet they haven't been nearly as successful as desired, with Zelenskyy still in power, the sanctions in place, and much of Ukraine not only unconquered but still with commercial access to the Black Sea. 

IMO Russia's sunk cost in money, men, material, economic disruption and lost prestige is so great that stopping at this point could possibly endanger Putin domestically. Putin's hope is likely to keep the pressure up and wait for either Ukraine to collapse or their allies to abandon them. Trump's attempt to stop the war just exposed where Russia really stands, and that is not wanting to stop the war.",2025-04-02T18:43:57

In fact I'm convinced that your position is correct that there is no evidence and that I would never find any anyway, and since knowing that now, I have come to the conclusion that America deserves only the worst that Donald Trump can deliver. The American people should be chastised by the authoritarian fascist leader for all of the rest of his life and his son should become the president of the United States after he is gone. And I do sincerely hope that all those that go against Donnie Jr will end up in some sort of prison that would once be deemed as illegal. I hope that all the foreigners from America that came here looking for hope Will be chastised by this administration because America deserves it and so do the people that would ever want to come here.

What values are those? Conservatism has only one real value: enforcement of a social hierarchy where the in-group (or rather a set of concentric in-groups) are privileged and protected at the expense of everyone and everything else. All the other ideological constructs, including religion, are elaborate facades to justify selfishness and exceptionalism. Sure, they believe in them, but that means nothing because they believe in reflections of their own needs and desires, and as such it is inherently malleable and self serving.

The current situation is an extrapolation of all that came before.

And unless it's a die hard and principled libertarian I never hear talk about American freedom from standard American conservatives.

My mom is German and pacifist, and got into a political argument with my sister's ex's brother about the Iraq war. He was in the military. Months later we were at their family's place for the 4th, and his aunt kept on trying to provoke my mother. For example talking about how she is a lesbian in a weirdly aggressive manner, (my mother obviously has no problem with that), and other freedom adjacent topics. And at some point she got up frustrated since she couldn't provoke my mother, and out of the blue said, ""well if you hate america so much you should go back where your from"". 


Another time my mother was at an airport MacDonald's around the time when most European countries said they wouldn't join in the Iraq war, and order French fries. When they were ready to be picked up, the worker came ""threw"" them at her, and said to her aggressively, ""here are your freedom fries!"" My mother hadn't spoken with them except to order.

Republicans are all united in the idea that they deserve some kind of power over others - it's an entitled mindset, similar to abusers, and 'Why Does He Do That?' by Lundy Bancroft helped me understand what to expect from them. 

Some think they should be higher-class citizens or others should be their slaves, others think they should be exempt from taxes or other laws, etc. 

On abusers' mindsets: for all of them, trying to appeal to principles doesn't work because arguments are only ways for them to protect their sense of entitlement or secure what they think they're owed. Pointing out their actual interests and how their actions are part of their strategy to achieve those goals is more effective than trying to convince them of a different view; they have no real values to appeal to aside from self-interest.  Silence from others is assumed to imply agreement with their views. They won't change until their values do (e.g. realizing they're hurting people they actually care about not hurting and decide this matters more than getting the power they think they're owed). ",2025-03-28T21:52:14

I will say, theoretically and purely hypothetically, that were one to ""remove the head of the serpent"", it would not stop this particular serpent.  

It would simply sprout a new, more competent head.  America loves to scapegoat massive systemic issues down to a single individual.  One bad apple, as it were.  If we removed this singular lynchpin, everyone would be magically cured of their rampant horribleness.  

If, in 1935, a certain Chancellor disappeared, others would have stepped into place.  Might even have ridden his corpse in as a martyr, to even greater and earlier success.  

Therefore I cannot advocate the singular action against a singular individual that may be seen as bannable.  But a group action... well...  That's an offline conversation.

Meanwhile, if Russia's oil revenue falls another 10%, the Russian economy will collapse. this was a brilliant strategic move by Ukraine

Instead, he's losing approval from the moderate and swing voters that flipped his way over the economy, wrongly believing that he would somehow reverse inflation simply because prices were lower the last time he was in office.

Obviously, anyone with even a basic grasp of economics would know prices are never going back where they were before, but I think the logic really was as simple as, ""Price was low when orange was president, so I vote for him and price will be low again.""

Now, barely two months in, he's fired a bunch of federal workers and an unelected dude with a chainsaw and sunglasses to hide that he's high as a kite is threatening to axe social security.

More information about voter turnout relative to county/precinct and additional analysis may be needed in order to definitively confirm the presence of this phenomenon in Clark County Early Voting results.

The whole ""ceasefire"" was mostly just getting Ukraine back to status quo with weapons and intel after Trump and Co weakened them. I have a hard time feeling like Trump will do anything great for Ukraine. I see one of three things happening: 

1) Trump admin complains about Russia and announces new ""extensive"" tariffs and banking controls to look tough but don't do much since they already are pretty locked out already.

2) Trump admin announces ""new"" weapons packages and intel support for Ukraine that are things already approved or expired and/or new stuff that is less than what Biden would send. So he basically takes credit for work already done or takes credit for just turning back to the status quo that he stopped. Trump admin claims they are impartial and not pro-russian because they are sending weapons to Ukraine (even though at a reduced rate than before and generally disrupting Ukraine).

3) Trump admin appeases Putin on a ""middle"" ground - they agree to not send weapons but will keep intel or vice versa. Net effect is still Ukraine is worse off than they were a few weeks ago while Trump admin claims victory over ceasefire as if it is some grand success.",2025-03-13T14:22:20

&gt; Now, with Russia’s military again grinding its way forward, the Trump administration has halted weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing that have been critical to Ukraine’s resistance against a three-year invasion by its giant neighbor that has killed tens of thousands and razed dozens of cities.

&gt; The impact of the halt—which U.S. officials described as a temporary pause designed to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate with Russia—will be limited at first, but is likely to grow over time as Ukraine’s stocks of U.S. ammunition run down, and weapons systems cannot be repaired or replaced, officials and analysts said. 

&gt; The main immediate impact will be felt from the cutoff of intelligence, which will constrain Ukraine’s ability to accurately target long-range strikes to knock out Russian troops and equipment before they reach the battlefield. On Friday, Maxar Technologies said that the U.S. has cut off Ukrainian access to the satellite images that the company supplies through an American government program—imagery used by Ukrainian forces to plan and mount operations, particularly using explosive drones.

&gt; A lack of fresh arms deliveries will take longer to have an impact but the effect would be broader. A dwindling stock of long-range air-defense missiles would erode Ukraine’s ability to intercept Russian ballistic missiles targeting cities. A lack of spares could see its top-performing infantry fighting vehicles and howitzers fall out of use. Although the immediate reaction from front-line soldiers was one of weary resilience, morale is likely to suffer as the withdrawal of support from Ukraine’s main backer saps confidence.",2025-03-09T17:23:08

But after arriving in Ukraine, the system’s software struggled and it failed to hit ballistic missiles, according to people familiar with the matter. Ukraine also soon ran low on the Aster missile that the Samp/T uses, they said. 

This reporting is inaccurate as written.

The SAMP/T and Aster 30 Block 1 (A30B1) have demonstrated effectiveness against tactical ballistic missile (TBM) threats in Ukraine. While SAMP/T has specific limitations in anti-tactical ballistic missile (ATBM) engagements due to the constraints of its Arabel 3D radar, it has still contributed to Ukraine’s air defense.

The success rate of both PATRIOT and SAMP/T in ATBM engagements continues to fluctuate as Russian tactics, penetration aids, electronic warfare measures and missile flight profiles evolve.

It is particularly questionable that the WSJ would publish this claim just as a country is nearing a decision to purchase the SAMP/T system.

From 2025, the SAMP/T NG will replace the Arabel radar with the Ground Fire 300 (France) and Kronos (Italy), enhancing its capabilities against aircraft, ballistic missiles, and drones, providing a more robust multi-layered defense.",2025-03-09T21:08:09

That is Ivanka as a preteen sitting on Donald's lap giving him bedroom eyes while they lean against a statue of two birds who are having sex. That was for a photoshoot in esquire magazine, that is what he wanted depicted.

Here is teenage/young adult Ivanka sitting on his lap at a concert. Check out the old man in the foreground, he 100% is like what the hell is that all about.

Here is one from Yahoo News where they are posing in bed for a photoshoot.

Yes it's hyperbolic, but do you really think that a large percentage of Maga Trump supporters would care that much if Trump doinked a 15 year old russian? They'd either ignore it, dismiss it as lies, suggest the girl lied about her age, or just straight up congratulate Trump.


And more seriously, there's absolutely 0% chance (and that's not hyperbole) that Trump would ever face prison for it.
Not least because it's a crime in Russia, and there's 0% chance that the US would imprison Trump and send him there for justice.

Sure a lot are corrupt. But hungary, romania and bulgaria are also corrupt.

They were a democracy right after the fall of the soviet union 30 years ago. But since then came more and more under their influence of Russia agaon and A LOT of the Ukrainian politicians were pro Russia and thus became a Satellite State, like Belarus, which is basicall Russia. A lot of the time they tried to do business with the EU as well but in 2013 euromaidan happened BECAUSE people didn't want to join the russian sphere of influence anymore and wanted to join the richer West and Nato. Though they wanted before and every time they got rejected

In came Zelensky voted in a landsloide withike 70% who is russian speaking but PRO West, EU and Pro Nato. Joining EU and Nato was declared a long term goal written in the constitution

This is when they became ally material or an ally

Russia wanted to stop that with declaring war and getting rid of Zelensky to install one of his puppets and make Ukraine a puppet state again lile Belarus. Right after euromaidan the russians took crimea and started a fake separatist war in the east, bringing in russian soldiers to fight as ukrainian separatists

If a country with 45 million people, right on our doorstep, rich in agriculture and resources desperately wants to become our ally, wants to Fight and is fighting corruption and is a functioning democracy why shouldnt we let them in?


The fate of the world DOES hinge on Ukraine. Why? Because putin has a to do list. China also has a to do list and they are watching what will come next. Ukraine losing will embolden China, either to take taiwan (which is bad since they will outtech us by far) or risk a world war

Russias list

1. Ukraine
2. Moldova
3. End Nato 
4. End EU if possible
5. Conquer Baltics &amp; other ""lost russian lands""

Etc. 

China:

1. Taiwan
2. Expand influence with fake islands (already doing it)
3. Eventually expand to influence south korea &amp; others
4. Start regime change wars or similar or just wars for mote land
 
Etc. 

If they are stuck at one of those points they can't Advance. If they see weakness while they are strong, they will attack and grab it. So being weak towards Russia will only make everything worse. 2014 crimea and the ongoing war in the east DIRECTLY led to the Invasion of 2022. I don't know how you cannot see that

It's real politics. There is no wishful thinking that you are doing. The world works by strength. Nothing else. 

You cannot wish away russian Aggression and be naive to think they will not attack again. They did attack in 2022 BECAUSE we didnt do shit in 2014

Also Trump is a russian asset and a literal manchurian candidate. He is doing russian politics FOR NO REASON. Only for personal gain and because he is brainwashed since the 80s. Russia is fucking weak compared to the US and Europe. They think of themselves as strong. But the ""3 day special military operation"" guys surely will not overestimate themselves against Europe again right? Right???

Ya, and how many of those ""neither"" siders are too chicken shit to admit that they sympathize with Putin, a long time enemy of the United States?

Better yet, how many of those responding ""neither"" have been consuming Kremlin propaganda and talking points, including rhetoric espoused by Trump himself, and right wing, social media content that has been denigrating Zelensky, blaming Ukraine for starting the war, and calling the country's president a ""dictator without elections?""

Responding ""neither"" amounts to one of a few things. 

That they're either uninformed or misinformed, that they simply don't care, that they're too embarrassed to confess that they think Putin is a superior ally, or that they've somehow been convinced of some false equivalence about Ukraine and Russia/Zelensky and Putin being both identically at fault for this war.",2025-03-03T04:15:39

&gt;Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke “Afro-American racists” to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should “introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.

The Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin

The historian John B. Dunlop observed, “There has perhaps not been another book published in Russia during the post-Communist period” that has exerted as much influence “on Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites,” adding, “If its ideas were to be implemented, then Ukraine would cease to exist.”

Russia was never going to try and invade two countries at once. But if they win in Ukraine, they have no intentions of stopping there. They’ll use the time after the war to recoup resources and then invade their next target. Russia’s playbook as a nation is actually extremely easy to predict because it’s literally all been written out (look up the foundations of geopolitics). Russia isn’t a threat because they’re going to invade every European nation at once, but because they’re an expansionist imperialist nation that will not be satisfied after each conquest. The same way that they started this was after the world tried appeasement after they annexed crimea in 2014. That’s not the threat of world war 3. The reality is that Putin doesn’t want peace, he wants to destroy Ukraine. He’s literally said as much. Again, this isn’t an isolated incident of invasion, it’s the follow up to a previous invasion where they already annexed a bunch of land. Also the reality is that if you want actual peace and not just the destruction of Ukraine, giving military aid to them is necessary. Diplomacy isn’t just some parallel alternative to war, the two are fundamentally two sides of the same coin. Diplomacy is a matter of leverage, no country has ever actually operated on purely good will in diplomacy. The best way for Ukraine to get a real peace agreement that will last is to give them the force to act as leverage. Otherwise you’ll get 2014 again where Russia ultimately comes out ahead, promises peace, takes a few years off to strengthen their forces, then breaks the agreement and invades again which is EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED the last time Russia invaded a decade ago. The idea that this is about Russia fearing Ukraine in NATO is demonstrably absurd. In part because that’s not even on the table now and was even less so before the war, and in part because nato already has based on Russian borders in other countries (not to mention that those type of range considerations are kind of obsolete in the era of ICBMs). And of course it suggests that Ukraine shouldn’t have the right to determine its own alliances on the basis of their own security interests because it might upset Russia.",2025-02-28T19:43:33

The house is on the other side of the block so chances are it won't spread to you, but the rest of the community is at risk and is rallying to try to stop it. They are looking to you for help since you are the de facto community leader, which is a role you greatly benefit from. Instead you seem more interested in helping the person who started the fire and looting the wreckage. 

Now people are wondering if you should be leader at all. Wondering why are you so friendly with the dude that's setting fires. That maybe the kids shouldn't go over for play dates. Maybe that business deal they were gonna go in with you on isn't a good idea anymore. You saved some money by not helping with the fire, but now everyone distrusts you and your only friend is an arsonist.",2025-03-01T00:31:34

Being a global leader doesn’t mean we have to bear the biggest burden every time there’s a conflict, especially when other European countries are just as capable of stepping up. Leadership isn’t about making endless sacrifices it’s about making smart decisions that balance responsibility with national interests. If we constantly prioritize foreign issues over our own, we weaken ourselves in the long run...",2025-03-01T01:38:02

USA is expected to take the lead because it has positioned itself as the global leader. But you're right, they don't have to take the lead, they can take a step back, but by doing so you are also taking a step back from that role as global leader and all the benefits that that position affords. Is that worth a few hundred billion? It doesn't seem like it would be to me but I don't know.

The US economy functions based on holding the reserve currency of the world. Providing a risk free place for the world to park cash. Implicit in this arrangement is the US place in world politics as a counter weight to bad actors (such as Russia). Trump et al are currently setting that agreement on fire to further their own financial benefit (and that of other wealthy American business men). The end result of this will be the world moving on from the US to seek other more stable partners, and no way to finance our current debt. The only way out of that will be for the US to lower interest rates and print more money, essentially a tax on Americans via high inflation. I hope you have your financials in order, because any non-tangible investments or cash you currently hold will go poof.",2025-02-28T19:43:12

Trusting Putin's assurances is like entrusting a fox to guard a henhouse. The outcome is predictable carnage.

Trump's confidence in such a deal is either willful naivety or a reflection of his own transactional ethos, where optics trump substance. Recall his own track record: abandoning the Iran nuclear deal, shredding the Paris Agreement, and undermining NATO - all while praising Putin's ""genius."" This is not a man known for discerning fine print or valuing consistency.

Putin could easily manipulate Trump into abandoning any security guarantees in the future. Just as Putin has Trump blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine, or Ukraine itself, he is easily swayed and distracted.

Meanwhile, the stakes are existential for Ukraine. A ""deal"" brokered on Putin's terms would legitimize territorial conquest and embolden autocrats worldwide. Reagan's ""trust but verify"" has devolved into ""trust and capitulate"" under Trump's hypothetical diplomacy.

The question isn't whether Trump could be hoodwinked, but how catastrophically. History won't judge kindly those who mistake conmen for statesmen.",2025-02-27T21:39:53

In 1855, Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter to a friend about the ""Know-Nothings"", a political party that the [Library of Congress](http://web.archive.org/web/20230204163717/https://www.loc.gov/wiseguide/oct02/parties.html) describes as:

&gt;The Know-Nothings started in 1849 as a secret organization with an anti-immigrant agenda. Reacting against the large tide of immigrants arriving in the 1840s, they actively promoted ""natives,"" which they defined as American-born Protestants. Because a large number of immigrants were foreign-born Catholics from Germany and Ireland, the Know-Nothings also took an anti-Catholic stance.

[Lincoln wrote](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/knownothingparty.htm) to his friend,

&gt;I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we begin by declaring that ""all men are created equal."" We now practically read it ""all men are created equal, except negroes."" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ""all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics."" When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty - to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy.

Also, those giving excuses that it is our fault because we didn't invest more in our NATO obligations, just shut up. This is nothing to do with. IT IS SIMPLY ABOUT THE UNITED STATES siding with an evil agressor.

I disagree with that. The headline is correct. The Trump administration represents all of the United States abroad, whether you voted for him or not, and his actions are the actions of the United States, so the United States has voted against condemning Russia. You can't wash your hands from that. We don't give other countries the benefit of the doubt, either. We say that Germany was responsible for the Second World War and the Holocaust and don't make a ""but actually"" exception for the many many people who didn't vote for Hitler. Precisely because there is no difference in outcome. In the same way, the United States is now responsible for having burned all its bridges with its allies, the United States is universally loathed for waging trade wars with the entire planet and the United States is being pitied for being nothing but a Russian lackey now.",2025-02-24T18:49:49

Thank you for the condescension. 

Whether your president is aligned in this case with his own State Department is neither here nor there. The fact of the matter is that the United States' delegation to the United Nations was unwilling to do the absolute bare minimum of supporting a non-binding General Assembly resolution condemning Russia. Nobody will make the discernment that this isn't State Department policy, when it obviously is aligned with the rest of the United States' abysmal diplomatic performance of the last five weeks. If anything, the fact that the US Executive is apparently unable to speak with one voice speaks volumes about the absolute chaos at the top of your administration and the reason the United States is being viewed the way that it is now.",2025-02-24T19:29:14

It's delusional to think the west has done a lot... The support was intentionally kept low to keep Ukraine from having a chance to win. And frankly it's a pittance considering it's a major land war and immense thread to the post ww2 world order.

It's also nonsense that Putin would kill his own country in a nuclear war just because he couldn't get Ukraine...

On the other hand Russia has shown again and again that it won't stop by itself. They have ramped up their military production massively and if they get Ukraine/Peace there is a good chance of a major war in Europe within 5 years.

  
""I haven't paid much attention to the UK or EU as a whole.""

Europe has provided more aid to Ukraine than the US (not even including paying for millions of refugees). As they should and it was still too little, but it's far from putting everything on the US.

Sadly, for certain weapon systems, production capacity and communications infrastucture (starlink), Europe can't replace the US and your support is crucial. You can't really say you support Ukraine and then force them to capitulate by action.

  
I#ve criticised for years that we, in Europe, don't spend enough to defend ourselves, but it's also not like the US didn't want the position of soft hegemon and the bases, power and influence that come with that. The resulting world order also made the US the richest country in history. That world order seems to be ending...

1iuxqs9,Trump tells governors he’s had better talks with Russia than Ukraine on ending war,Cautious_Ad_5659,36,2025-02-21T18:21:49,gearstars,1,"Your timeline is off. russia started interfering when Ukraine wanted to join the EU economic bloc, at a time when there was little interest in joining NATO. 

&gt;Since 2012, Ukraine and the EU had been negotiating a free trade and association agreement. In 2013, the Ukrainian Parliament overwhelmingly approved finalizing the agreement with the EU, and Yanukovych urged parliament to adopt laws so that Ukraine would meet the EU's criteria and be able to sign the agreement in November 2013.

&gt;Russia, however, put pressure on Ukraine to reject the EU Association Agreement. In August 2013, Russia began restricting Ukrainian imports, which Ukraine's opposition parties described as ""a trade war"" to pressure the country not to sign the agreement. The agreement was to be finalized at a summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. On 21 November, a week before the summit, Yanukovych suddenly announced he was pulling out of the agreement, and instead strengthening economic ties with Russia. Jovita Neliupšienė, foreign policy aide to Lithuania's president Dalia Grybauskaitė, said Yanukovych had called her to say he had changed his mind due to what she called Russian ""economic pressure and blackmail"". The Lithuanian president's office said Russia had threatened Ukraine with huge trade losses and job losses if it signed the EU agreement.

The start of the war in 2014 is what sparked Ukrainin interest in joining NATO

&gt;In 2010, during the premiership of Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian parliament voted to abandon the goal of NATO membership and re-affirm Ukraine's neutral status, while continuing its co-operation with NATO. In the February 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Ukraine's parliament voted to remove Yanukovych, but the new government did not seek to change its neutral status. Russia then occupied and annexed Crimea, and in August 2014 Russia's military invaded eastern Ukraine to support its separatist proxies. Because of this, in December 2014 Ukraine's parliament voted to end its neutral status, and in 2018 it voted to enshrine the goal of NATO membership in the Constitution.

&gt;Polls held before 2014 found low support among Ukrainians for NATO membership. However, Ukrainian public support for NATO membership has risen greatly during the Russo-Ukrainian War, and there has been overwhelming public support for joining NATO since the 2022 Russian invasion. 

And you said

&gt; Fact of the matter is Putin's always been willing to work out a deal 

What ""deal"", exactly? Did he offer to retreat to the original pre-2014 borders and return Crimea? What has his ""peace plan"" been that wouldn't completely fuck over Ukraine?",2025-02-21T20:05:34

But hey, I've got some tea left, I can do the list thing ...

&gt; What is your definition of victory?

Russia fucking back off behind the line.

&gt; What’s your strategy for victory?

I'm not a military strategist. 

&gt; When will this victory be achieved?

I don't have a crystal ball.

&gt; We’re already three years in. When I look at the map of the back and forth of territorial gains and losses in Ukraine, I’m reminded of the trench warfare during World War I. Thousands of young men, an entire generation dying in a war of inches. If nothing changes, how long are you willing to demand this continues? Give me your time limit. Five more years? Ten more years? Tell us when you will say this war has gone on too long.

It's already gone on too long.

&gt; How much money should the U.S. pour into this war? We’re already about $200 billion in, much of it unaccounted for. Tell us what dollar amount will be too much for you.

I don't care about the dollar amount particularly. When a country signs a treaty assuring the security of another, that's supposed to mean something.

&gt; What are the downsides of a peace deal?

Depends on the specifics of the peace deal.

&gt; Have you considered the fact that a peace deal might leave Ukraine with more land than if the war continues or Ukraine loses?

Of course.

&gt; If all our previous aid packages didn’t make a difference, what makes you believe the next one will?

Depends on the specifics of the aid. 

&gt; Why are you really okay with Zelensky outlawing 11 opposition parties and canceling a presidential election? A war is no excuse. Abraham Lincoln stood for reelection in the middle of a much worse situation: a civil war. Lincoln also believed he would lose. Must we destroy democracy to save democracy?

This is an incredibly stupid question. In simple, practical terms, it's almost impossible to have an election at all when the country is occupied and so many of their people are on the front line or otherwise displaced. Also, it would be unconstitutional, the Ukrainian public oppose an election now, and the Ukrainian opposition support the postponement until the war is over.

Also, love the irony of the pro-coup crowd pretending to care about democracy. 

&gt; If Trump is so pro-Putin, why doesn’t he pull our support from Ukraine and walk away, Enjoy your war, pal. Instead, he’s risking political capital to get a peace deal.

He is trying to walk away, he's just aiming to have an excuse for it. He's ""negotiating"" a ""peace deal"" without one of the two parties required for there to be a peace deal. His plan is to demand what Russia demanded (which he's already done) and, when Ukraine inevitably refuses, to then use that as an excuse to walk away. 

&gt; When did y’all — especially those on the left — begin to oppose the pursuit of peace?

When did y'all - especially those on the far-right - become so enthusiastic about authoritarian regimes seizing territory through violent means?",2025-02-21T07:33:13

Don't get me wrong.  I support Ukraine.  I support supporting Ukraine.  I think it is in America's interest to support Ukraine much more comprehensively than we're doing now, including the use of American troops.  I'd be willing to go to war with Russia over Ukraine.

1iul855,Nolte: 11 Sincere Questions for Ukraine War Supporters,redditor01020,0,2025-02-21T07:20:26,Quexana,2,"1. Ukraine controls its pre-2014 borders.
2. My strategy?  Or the one the U.S. has employed thus far?  I'll agree that the current U.S. strategy is not conducive to the goal of returning Ukraine to it's pre-2014 borders.  Personally, I'd assemble a coalition similar to the first Gulf War, mostly led by European ground troops, but bolstered by some American troops and especially American air power and American logistics to destroy the invading army.
3. When Ukraine controls its pre-2014 borders.  The U.S. has never had an end date for war.  We didn't tell the allies in WWII that we were only going to be in it for a set amount of time.  The famous WWII song ""Over There"" doesn't say ""We'll be over, we're coming over And we won't come back till the deadline.""  It says we'll come back when it's over, over there.
4. Yes, there is trench warfare, but only a mindless idiot would look at only the trench warfare and say that it's like WWI.  If there's a stalemate, we need to provide Ukraine the type of support that would break the stalemate... like air superiority.
5. I wouldn't like to put a dollar figure on it, but given that this war is far more important to American security and American interests than Iraq ever was, and we spent $2 Trillion on Iraq, I'd put the figure significantly above that.
6. It depends on the terms of the peace.  If we're considering the terms of peace Trump seems to be offering, what are the downsides of appeasing an expansionist dictator who has, on numerous occasions, voiced his goal of controlling (Either directly or through client states) practically the entire area of the former Soviet Union, dominating a population of over 200 million, including NATO countries?
7. I have.  You know who else has?  Ukraine.  And they're still willing to fight.  The sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is worth fighting for to Ukraine.  Depriving Russia of Ukraine is absolutely in American interests.  So long as those two things are true, the war should continue.
8. It won't, because, as I said previously, I'm readily willing to admit that our current strategy is not conducive to victory.  Biden did some good things regarding Ukraine, but ultimately, he was too weak and feckless for the moment.  Trump is more weak and feckless than Biden is.  Neither one are willing to commit to what is necessary for victory.
9. I find it concerning, but not a dealbreaker.  You can't have a free and fair Presidential election when a significant portion of your country is behind enemy lines.  If you want to make future aid contingent on Ukraine holding an internationally monitored election, I'll go along with it.  I'm not unreasonable.  Then again, the people making this argument aren't holding Russia to that same standard.
10. The peace deal he's offering is a peace deal on Russia's terms.  Russia wants the territory, but they also want international acceptance of Russia's seizure of territory.  They want the sanctions dropped.  They want back into the G7.  They want global acceptance of their expansionism.  They can't get global acceptance without a peace deal.  They won't be able to quickly rebuild and reconstitute their military for further expansionist wars without a peace deal and the resumption of normal trade.  Trump is trying to give them that.
11. I don't oppose the pursuit of peace.  Putin is the one who broke the peace.  Peace is not just the absence of hostility.  Peace, sustainable peace, requires justice.  I'm not a pacifist.  I just don't support stupid wars.  I supported Afghanistan.  I supported the first Gulf War.  I did not support Iraq, Libya, or Syria.  Ukraine is not a stupid war.",2025-02-21T11:09:53

The collapse of the Putin regime. But I can live Ukrainian sovereignty over all of Ukraine

&gt;When will this victory be achieved?

Would you ask this of Lincoln in 1863? Roosevelt in 1943?

 &gt;We’re already three years in. When I look at the map of the back and forth of territorial gains and losses in Ukraine, I’m reminded of the trench warfare during World War I.

Would you have asked this question during the Summer of 1863? During the Battle of the Bulge?

  &gt;What are the downsides of a peace deal?

There is no peace deal on the table. Merely a deal to screw over Ukraine. 

 &gt;Have you considered the fact that a peace deal might leave Ukraine with more land than if the war continues or Ukraine loses?

That is Ukraine's choice to make, not mine. 

&gt;If all our previous aid packages didn’t make a difference, what makes you believe the next one will?

Putin literally had opeds praising his victory written and ready to go. Aid has made a difference.

Abraham Lincoln stood for reelection in the middle of a much worse situation: a civil war. Lincoln also believed he would lose. Must we destroy democracy to save democracy?

Every party banned was banned because it was corrupted by Russia. Lincoln did not stand for reelection in a worse situation, the South chose to exclude itself. It was not cut off from the rest of the country. 

 &gt;If Trump is so pro-Putin, why doesn’t he pull our support from Ukraine and walk away, Enjoy your war, pal. Instead, he’s risking political capital to get a peace deal.

What capital is Trump risking? He wants to hand everything to Putin on a silver platter. 

 &gt;When did y’all — especially those on the left — begin to oppose the pursuit of peace?

Since day one of this war, ""Peace"" has only meant surrender to Russia's naked imperialism. Any who actually wants peace should, no must stand for Ukraine against aggression and imperialism.

The Russo-Ukrainian War[d] began in February 2014. Following Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity, Russia occupied and annexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported pro-Russian separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donbas War. These first eight years of conflict also included naval incidents and cyberwarfare. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country, starting the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. The war has resulted in a refugee crisis and tens of thousands of deaths.

Just as Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine that flattened large of parts of the country, Germany, in 1914, launched unprovoked invasions of Belgium and France that devastated and ground up large parts of those countries (after a couple of years of craving war with Russia and using the assassination of Franz Ferdinand as pretext for the global expansion of the feud between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire).

Yet, how often is it said that there were no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" in the First World War? Even historians act like the war was a total accident and nobody's to blame for its suffering. The truth is that the truth lost the ""war"" over memory of World War I. We mustn't let that happen for the memory of the causes of World War II (where Nazi Germany and Japan are to blame) and the Russo-Ukrainian War (where Fascist Russia is obviously to blame).

This was making Japan’s position untenable and so they calculated that a war was inevitable and so made the first attack just like they did in Port Arthur during the Russian-Japanese war.

However this glosses over the atrocities they committed in China and elsewhere, the fact that they were a brutally repressive fascist state and the fact that even with all these factors in place, they still attacked America without a declaration of war.",2025-02-20T11:21:19
1itmj3u,Pence denounces Trump’s claim Ukraine started war,Xayton,7709,2025-02-20T01:25:30,BigBennP,8,"So this is the difference between the stuff that you would learn in a world history class that covers this material as a part of larger events and a 300 or 400 seminar level history class that focuses on the modern history of Japan and Japan as a political player in the modern world. 

The sort of broad Strokes world history summary is that in 1931 Japan invaded manchuria, and in 1937 Japan invaded china. It may talk about Japanese atrocities in China.  Then it will talk about how Japanese military leaders saw oil Rich Indonesia as essential to their National Security and the only way they could claim them was a massive surprise attack against the US and British forces protecting their colonial interests in the area in the hopes that the distance and effort involved with retaking those areas would be too much for countries that were already working to contain Germany and they would let it be.   

The more detailed class is going to trace Japanese history since the Meiji restoration, the prominence of the military class and the Bushido ideology in Japan and the sort of national sense of grievance that the Western Powers had carved up the world into colonies, but when Japan came into its own as an industrial power,  they were told that the door has closed and that sort of thing would no longer be permitted.

So I haven’t read his books per se but from what my relative has said, Maybury does a lot of both-sidesing in both world wars, and largely blames the US for getting involved in a war they had “nothing to do with”. He’s a libertarian type so that should paint a picture for you.

Re homeschooling, I’d be curious to hear your thoughts, as I was homeschooled myself. I think I came out of it fairly ok, but I’d be interested in comparing experiences lol",2025-02-20T21:19:23
1itmj3u,Pence denounces Trump’s claim Ukraine started war,Xayton,7709,2025-02-20T01:25:30,DjinnOftheBeresaad,1,"So, I came up in the 90s and that's when most of mine was done. Midwestern stuff. I also would say that I came out fairly okay. I did have some gaps in math, and to this day I don't really know if I am bad at math because of the gaps or if I would have been bad at math anyway. Hard to say. 

We were also rural and isolated, and as you can imagine with homeschooling in the mix that makes for a pretty big lack of socialization. My parents did try to offset that with programs that involved other homeschooled kids in the area. Siblings and I did have socialization, but it certainly wasn't hours per day most days per week like you'd get in a public school. I felt I was undersocialized when I moved away for college and thus attended like literally every single extracurricular event I could time permitting to work on my socializing hardcore. I think it helped a lot. 

Ah, so... I don't have a negative view of homeschooling in general and I know it can be helpful for lots of different kinds of kids, especially today compared to 70s, 80s, or 90s where you saw it a lot more just for religious reasons more than anything else. I know there's different kinds of kids out there who can benefit from it. 

That said, I'm quite critical of it. But it's not because I think it's bad. It's because I think that to do a good job, you have to be really heavily invested in it. And since at least one of the parents will be the primary educator, you have to really commit. I think my mum did so, and even still, like I said there were some gaps. They couldn't have afforded to bring someone in to fill in the stuff they didn't know how to explain, but ideally I think one should have some kind of access to this (but of course it is much different today with way better internet resources than when I was growing up, so perhaps it is less an issue today.)

The other part is that we had set standards and milestones that we had to meet according to law. Every couple of years a state rep would come out to administer comprehensive testing to us to make sure we were on the same track as our public school peers and not lagging. I've since learned that either these standards changed in recent years or different areas of the country have way different rules because I know people from different states who literally only have to sign a form each year. The state just trusts them that their kids are on track. Speaking frankly, I find that to be kinda wild. I don't think it is an imposition to let the state do a check to see if the kids are at the level they should be at.

So that's kind of how I feel about it. Mixed feelings, I guess you could say. I try to give benefit of the doubt since mine turned out mostly fine and I was able to fix what wasn't.",2025-02-20T23:02:43

They massacred civilians by the 100’s in reprisals for any attacks.  More than 600 were shot in Dinant.     Not soldiers, just regular civilians.

The city of Leuven was burned down, not because of a battle, but because the Germans suspected some lome snipers taking potshots at them.
  
Leuven has been a university city since the middle ages and when the library burned down countless old manuscripts went up into flames.    
  
Later people starved because food was withheld from the Belgian population so they could feed themselves.

While this event provided the immediate trigger, it was the complex interplay of rigid alliance commitments, aggressive militarism, and the expansionist ambitions of several nations that transformed a regional dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia into a global conflict. Austria-Hungary aimed to consolidate its influence in the Balkans, Russia was motivated by Pan-Slavism and a desire to expand its reach, and Germany’s backing of Austria-Hungary—coupled with its own strategic ambitions—further escalated tensions. Meanwhile, France and Britain were driven by their own geopolitical and imperial interests.

*FOUR* legal changes of ownership in 75 years. Europe is sometimes said to be built on the French-German friendship and it's not for nothing.  

WW2 is hard to justify, but I would be hard pressed to find a reason why the previous two are politically different from each other. Territorial conflicts, alliances triggers, no side wants to back down, no country wants to break their alliance, war.  
 
Wars became a huge issue because humans became VERY good at making VERY efficient weapons. It took us WW1 to understand wars have to be stopped and WW2 to understand (or so we thought) how to ACTUALLY avoid armed conflicts.",2025-02-20T12:32:27

Well, that's what I was also taught.  
For starters, it wasn't ""First World War"", but ""the Great War"", the war which would end all wars.  
Why? *Because until then, a war was something ""normal"" and the GW showed them wrong*  

So the question you forgot to ask is ""why was WW1 so different? the colonies weren't THAT strategical"" Remember France had lost territory to Germany in... 1870 I believe, so why not a rematch 40 years later?  
*The issue isn't political but technological.* Humanity created weapons that could only be dreamed 2 gens ago, allowing a few soldiers to kill a lot more people. The gases, the planes with automated guns through the helix, etc.  
In the 20th century, bringing a huge lot of soldiers rushing to the enemy wouldn't work anymore. A machinegun doesn't care if a human or a horse is in front of it.  

And I think that WW2 was locked in our timeline the second my side forced Germany to be considered the sole responsible of the war, through the Versailles Treaty. The huge repairs from Germany (for a war they didn't even start, remember the Sarajevo assasination) combined to a fear of the next war allowed a German politician to put Europe to its knees 20y later under the false promises of a ""thousand year peace"". And *that* war lead us to the Nuclear Bomb, with a really clear message ""humanity, do this mistake ONCE MORE, and you won't have to worry about future peace anymore"".

The talking point itself was one which was pushed hard leading to, and in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, and doubly so after the ""special operation"" started.

So you're inferring that we should have intervened sooner and mass murdered a bunch of Iraqi civilians a little earlier?  What is wrong with you.

You're being intellectually dishonest, because you don't know enough to make an actual good-faith argument.  No, Americans won't say that, obviously.

The MAGA movement has deeply embedded itself within a significant portion of the American electorate. This isn't just about policies; it's about a strong sense of identity and unwavering loyalty to a specific vision for the country's future. Mike Pence, despite any positive efforts or rebuttals he might offer, is unlikely to sway the minds of those who are steadfastly committed to MAGA principles. The movement's influence runs deep, and its supporters are resolute in their beliefs. Therefore, any pushback from Pence, however well-intentioned, will probably fall on deaf ears.

1itmj3u,Pence denounces Trump’s claim Ukraine started war,Xayton,7709,2025-02-20T01:25:30,rendumguy,1,"I check on the Asktrumpsupporters sub from time to time to see the rationale for them defending, what seems to be indefensible policies, and I noticed that there's no post asking about Trump accusing Ukraine of starting the war.  


Are they censoring that?  Because there isn't a defense for claiming a small victim country started a war with a hostile invading nation.


Also, I hate Pence and his policies, and for a while I rejected the notion that he should get any credit for doing the bare minimum of not overturning the election.  But now, I retract that.  I see now that Pence *could* have chosen to start a constitutional crisis around Jan 6th.  He could have later tried to support Trump's efforts to steal the election, and he could be supportive of every authoritarian thing he's doing, but he isn't.


I will always dislike him for his support of toxic policies, but he screwed himslef over so as to not destroy the Constitution.

The fact that no one cared back then and only started caring once an actor became president speaks volumes to me. All in all, it should hopefully come to an end sooner than later. 

  It’s not a matter of being an apologist, you have to understand that Ukraine has been indebted towards Russia for many many years now. I understand that Russia and Ukraine had an agreement that they would offer them protection.. nonetheless once Russia hit them with the bill they decided to runoff tornado and the EU. Why doesn’t anyone talk about this?",2025-02-19T18:27:31

Conservatives fundamentally believe in social hierarchies that they believe must be strictly followed (that’s what they are ‘conserving’ the social hierarchy). Now Trump and ‘MAGA’ are ultra aggressive in this belief, that’s what all their ‘anti-DEI’ here is about, they see non-white/hetro/male people in places in society they don’t believe those ‘types’ of people belong and they are out to ‘rectify that. They want their old power dynamic back where the ‘right’ people are on top of society telling the ‘lower’ ones what to do. BUT this also applies to international relations between nations! 

For Trump there are certain nations that are just supposed to ‘rule’ over the others. There is supposed to be an international ‘order’ all nations follow mostly based on who’s ‘strongest thus most deserving’. And just like domestically if you ‘get out of that ‘order’ it’s your fault for what happens to you. Trump thinks that like just like he views Canada and Mexico that Ukraine is supposed to do what the big boy next door tells them to do, since this is all the ‘correct’ order as he sees it. It’s the whole I’m hitting you because YOU got out of line bullshit. Ukraine didn’t listen to Russia as they are supposed to and tried to join the west so for MAGA that’s enough to say ‘you started this by not listening to your better’.

excerpt::

&gt;Some have claimed that the influence on Trump goes back even further. Yuri Shvets, a KGB major who was posted to Washington, DC in the 1980s, claimed that the Soviet Union started cultivating Trump more than 40 years ago.

&gt;[*American Kompromat: How the KGB Cultivated Donald Trump*](https://books.telegraph.co.uk/Product/Craig-Unger/American-Kompromat--how-the-KGB-cultivated-Donald-Trump-a/26868145) by journalist Craig Unger claims that the KGB identified Trump as a young businessman on the rise as early as 1977, after he married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková. Shvets, a source for the book, said that an electronics shop near Trump’s hotel, the Grand Hyatt New York, was really a KGB front. When the Trumps visited Russia for the first time in 1987, KGB operatives flattered Trump and told him he ought to go into politics.

&gt;“It was a charm offensive,” Shvets told *The Guardian*. “They had collected a lot of information on \[Trump’s\] personality so they knew who he was personally. The feeling was that he was extremely vulnerable intellectually, and psychologically, and he was prone to flattery.

&gt;“This is what they exploited. They played the game as if they were immensely impressed by his personality and believed this is the guy who should be the president of the United States one day: it is people like him who could change the world. They fed him these so-called ‘active measures’ soundbites and it happened. So it was a big achievement for the KGB active measures at the time.”

He's destroying America and he's doing it using Putin's playbook, like the firehouse of falsehood bullshit and slowly gaining more dictatorial powers until he becomes president for life. He's had coaching from Putin. There's a network of Russian tools like Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk, and many others who have been travelling to Russia or speaking to Putin, getting information from Putin and relaying it to Trump. You can't convince me otherwise. Other media figures linked to Russia have helped Trump's rise like Jordan Peterson (visited Russia to get treatment done. Canada's prime minister testified that he is a Russian asset funded by Russia). Tim Pool aka Dim Tool (paid by Russia). Dave Rubin (paid by Russia). There are also politicians influenced by Russia like Tulsi Gabbard. These are only the people we know of. Some are unwitting tools. Then of course there's Michael Flynn. The rot goes deep. Putin started out as a spy, not a politian, and it shows. His spycraft has created an intricate web that has entangled almost every aspect of American politics. ",2025-02-19T13:36:32

Trump burst the gates in the US, and the tide is there... but for me Trump has always been the symptom of years and decades in the making.


Trump HAS set a large path/inspiration for other populist leaders and Think Tanks like from Project 2025.


But (initially) he was and is the SYMPTOM. Don't forget that the UK also had Brexit referendum (in my opinion, it is another symptom) before Trump's 1st US election. Don't think this was due to Trump.


My 2 cents pov, who voted against Trump in all 3 elections and who is freaking scared of all what he is doing to democracy, but cannot reason with the people (coworkers, and yes even family members) who did vote for Trump and drink the koolaid.

This is one of the most inexplicable flip-flops in the world political order, and it all seems to be for some kind of unverified personal reason for Trump. It's like the one thing he has been hell-bent on going back to his last term.

This is how multinational corporations, like Elon and the other tech oligarchs, work. They don’t have any concept of loyalty or patriotism to a country. They don’t know what empathy or shame are. It’s about money and power, plain and simple, no matter how many governments and lives they ruin.

The depressing thing about Trump is that his relationships with these dictators are very simple. They flatter him and they play him because he’s an awful negotiator who will give away anything to a strongman who says “you’re one of us too!”",2025-02-18T23:20:09

* A 100% no strings attached victory for Russia, which is the Trump agenda, in the long term will open the door for more large scale conflicts. Not only in Europe but elsewhere. Why wouldn't China invade Taiwan now?

It would have been over in a few weeks without Europe and US support. But Ukraine has made huge strides in the last few months and Russia has had failure after failure.

The North Koreans came in to help, but may have hurt more than anything. France, Spain, and Canada have also committed to sent more missile systems.
    
You are also partially right on Europe being the in the peace process, but so far Ukraine isn't part of the peace process. Don't forget they are the victims here. At one point the US were the ones to stand up to tyranny, but we have failed here.

Russia is close to buckling. Putin knows that as long as Western support continues his genocidal war is doomed. With an economy the size of Italy there's only so long he can maintain it. Time is fast running out. Russia is rapidly running out of money. The exchange rate is being artificially boosted by forcing banks to give the government loans. It can't go on.

https://x.com/JayinKyiv/status/1878487780994781692

If Trump fully gave Ukraine the military aid they need he could end this war in Ukraine's favour in no time and the rest of the world would bow down in front of him in gratitude, including most Russians, who are sick and tired of it. That would be a surefire route to the Nobel Peace prize. Hand Ukraine to Russia and he will be remembered by history as  a weak man and a Quisling. 

Gifting Ukraine to Putin is also a green light to Russia, China, and North Korea to do ""What the hell they want"" to quote Trump. Those that think this is not going to have ramifications for the US need to think again. Isolationism didn't do wonders for America's security in 1941. Today is no different. And US influence in world affairs will begin a downhill slide it will never recover from.

Putin is the head of the Hydra. If Russia loses it's the end of Putin. He must be defeated or the free world, yes, including the US, will pay a heavy price down the line. Continuing to support Ukraine is the easiest, and cheapest, way America can ensure its interests and security remain strong.

Trump's route to the prize is in ending the scourge of Russia's constant meddling in our democracies and not in the sacrifice of a sovereign nation and its people to the genocidal intentions of its despot neighbour.",2025-02-17T19:19:12

You have to remember the context of when NATO was created. The world had fought two devastating world wars that were mostly the result of European greed and colonialism, and while the U.S. wanted to control Soviet expansionism, we also had a foreign policy goal of ending most overseas European empires, even of our allies, so it was largely done under the umbrella of U.S. military might and our nuclear umbrella.  Nobody wanted to see a strong German military ever again, in particular. And then after the fall of the Berlin Wall happened, everyone wanted to demilitarize the continent. 

Keep in mind that military spending is fundamentally wasteful and destructive.  If Russia isn’t a threat, and it wasn’t for about a decade after the fall of the wall, it doesn’t really make sense to spend a ton of money on the military. 

The real flaw is that the west just utterly and completely failed to recognize the threat posed by Putin, until it was too late. Not just militarily but in terms of protecting their own democracies.",2025-02-17T17:25:18

The fact remains, Russia has been ground to mincemeat.  No military experts thought that would happen.  The E.U. managed it,  far above anyone's expectations. It's a total fiasco for Russia and for Putin.

There's no such thing as ""people of Crimea"" having a single opinion on Ukraine and Russia. The area, mostly due to things done long ago by the Soviet Union, is tragically divided, as was already shown in the 1991 Ukraine independence referendum, which overall was a landslide victory, but in Crimea the result was 54-46 (luckily still for independence, as otherwise Russian claims would actually have some legs to stand on).

&gt;the 2 percent benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense

Which was widely ignored all the time until the recent war started. The benchmark was set in 2014, only six countries were above this in 2021, and even now [9 of 32 are still below](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/whos-at-2-percent-look-how-nato-allies-have-increased-their-defense-spending-since-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/). Which is super annoying to me, as I live in one of the few European NATO countries which were above the two percent even in 2021.

If Trump wasn't a Russian stooge – and these are not empty accusations, his own words and actions, as well as multiple bipartisan Senate and intelligence reports strongly suggest that's what he is – we could make sure that Ukraine doesn't suffer the fate you're predicting.

&gt;Let’s review the record. Despite inveighing against “endless wars,” Trump massively escalated the country’s existing wars in multiple theaters, leading to skyrocketing casualties. In Afghanistan, he substantially upped the amount of airstrikes, leading to a 330% increase in civilian deaths. In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the devastating Saudi-led war against the Houthis. According to the United Kingdom’s Bureau of Investigative Journalism, there were 2,243 drone strikes in just the first two years of Trump’s presidency, compared with 1,878 in the entire eight years of the Obama administration.

&gt;Trump also came very close to tweeting the country into a nuclear war with North Korea in late 2017 and early 2018, a completely self-inflicted incident that seems to have been bizarrely memory-holed.

&gt;In 2018, Trump bowed to Washington’s neoconservative hawks and withdrew from a working nonproliferation agreement with Iran, resulting in Iran scaling up both its provocative activities in the region and its nuclear program. According to current U.S. assessments, Iran could now make enough fissile for one nuclear bomb in under two weeks, should it decide to do so. Under the agreement Trump abandoned, it would’ve taken Iran at least a year. The list goes on...",2025-02-12T20:48:50

Many Kremlin propagandists are active on social media doing their utmost to undermine support for Ukraine, because Putin knows that as long as Western support continues his genocidal war is doomed. With an economy the size of Italy there's only so long he can maintain it. Time is fast running out. Russia is rapidly running out of money. The exchange rate is being artificially inflated by forcing banks to give the government loans.

It can't go on. If Trump fully gave Ukraine the military aid they need he could end this war in Ukraine's favour in no time and garner the thanks of the rest of the world, including most Russians, who are sick and tired of it. He might even get nominated for the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts. Hand Ukraine to Russia and he will be reviled as the leader who opened the door to the destruction of a sovereign country and the genocide of millions of its innocent citizens.

If Ukraine loses it's also a green light to Russia, China, and North Korea to do ""What the hell they want"" to quote Trump. If you think that's not going to have ramifications for the US think again. American influence in world affairs will begin a downhill slide they will never recover from.

They will test the water of Article 5 and see how it goes. They see we did nothing in 2014. They see we've slomo'd support in the last year.

He will gamble on it because he's a narcissist like Trump and a megalomaniac who sees his destiny in bringing Russkiy Mir to the whole world. He thinks he's another Peter the Great. And he's in charge, not the government.

I'll repeat here what I said to the OP earlier.

You know that Putin's goal is the annexation of the whole of Ukraine and the murder of anyone who doesn't fall in line? He's failed so far thanks to Western support.

Many Kremlin propagandists are active on social media doing their utmost to undermine support for Ukraine, because Putin knows that as long as Western support continues his genocidal war is doomed. With an economy the size of Italy there's only so long he can maintain it. Time is fast running out. Russia is rapidly running out of money. The exchange rate is being artificially inflated by forcing banks to give the government loans.

https://x.com/JayinKyiv/status/1878487780994781692

It can't go on. If Trump fully gave Ukraine the military aid they need he could end this war in Ukraine's favour in no time and garner the thanks of the rest of the world, including most Russians, who are sick and tired of it. He might even get nominated for the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts. Hand Ukraine to Russia and he will be reviled as the leader who opened the door to the destruction of a sovereign country and the genocide of millions of its innocent citizens.

If Ukraine loses it's also a green light to Russia, China, and North Korea to do ""What the hell they want"" to quote Trump. If you think that's not going to have ramifications for the US think again. American influence in world affairs will begin a downhill slide they will never recover from.

Putin is the head of the Hydra. If Russia loses it's the end of Putin. He must be defeated or the free world, yes, including the US, will pay a heavy price down the line. Continuing to support Ukraine is the cheapest way America can ensure its interests and security remain strong.

In monetary terms the aid amounts to a tiny fraction of US military spend. And most of it stays in the US anyway as is used updating stocks with more modern equipment. Most of the aid is equipment that was mothballed and would be more expensive to decommission than give away.",2025-02-12T22:29:14

All he's shown us is that he's eager to cave into Putin's demands. Even suggesting the U.S. withdraw from NATO.

This is as good a time as any to remind people of just how great an asset Trump has been for Putin.

During Trump's first term, he frequently repeated Kremlin propaganda about things like the annexation of Crimea, about NATO in particular, and about the threat of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.

Trump has repeated Putin's false claims about Ukraine that served as a pretext for his invasion.

Trump said that Putin did *""an amazing job of taking the mantle""* when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.""*

Trump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.

Ahead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,""

Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign ""expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts""

Trump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.

After the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *""If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?""*

In 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be ""watered down."" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot the sanctions down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.

In response to Putin being labeled a ""killer"" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *""I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.""* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *""There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?""*

Trump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. 

Trump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian ""diplomats.""

Trump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.

Trump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goals—the weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO ""obsolete,"" and has reportedly, on several occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO.

Trump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.

The Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.

Trump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.

Trump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.

Let's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.

Trump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine ""genius,"" and ""savvy,"" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are ""delinquent."" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.

Trump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *""I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,""*

Trump doesn't even know how NATO works...

in 2014, NATO members agreed to move ""toward"" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024.

&gt; The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or ""delinquency"" involved.

Despite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO ""fund"", but towards their own defense.

Trump has called the U.S., *""the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.""* Not comprehending that the funding benchmark has to do with each country's own defense spending. We're not ""paying for NATO."" In fact, our military spending has actually decreased over recent years.

NATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.

Trump campaigned on the idea of capitulating to Putin. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, just like that. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.

That's because Putin is also looking to consolidate power. His goal is to annex as much of Ukraine as possible, rob its people of their independence, then continue with his ""special military occupation,"" err, I mean *operation* into other regions of Eastern Europe, where he will expand his oil empire and create soviet-like ""spheres of influence"" in territories that his military seizes.

Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war wouldn't have happened. Not only is this delusional, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place, and as president, he will continue to help advance Putin's autocratic, escalating, warmongering, land grabbing agenda, as well as his efforts to expand his control over oil.",2025-02-09T05:39:37

Even removing sanctions may not be enough at this point. Russia is on the precipice of economic collapse and Ukraine's drone attacks against oil infrastructure are accomplished with homegrown weaponry.


With the current trajectory (if Trump did nothing) Russia is guaranteed to lose the war. They've already lost. Only Trump injecting money into Russia could stop that now.


If Russia had gotten this play a year ago it would have fucked Ukraine completely, but now who knows.


Regardless, all Zelensky has to do is say, ""We don't accept the offered peace"" and the war continues. Trump can't force Ukraine to capitulate from this position, he can only entice them to capitulate or force them to survive without US support.

Trump said that US spent 200 billion more than other nato countries, and then Zelensky corrected him by saying that actually, US only sent 75 billion. (In weapons value, not any actual money) (edit: only 70k in weapons, and 7 billion or more in cash)

In other words, your argument is that America is giving free hand outs, more than anyone else, but then you bring up an example of how Trump lied about how much America is actually giving out helping?

A financial obligation is a term for a contract which mandates the payment of that amount under some terms and conditions.

Key word here is under some terms and conditions. For example when you're obligated to pay off a loan, you don't just pay off the full amount at once. You pay off say $300 a month. 

All this suggests is that the money is there allocated for Ukraine but it just hasn't been sent yet. I think Zelenskys response might have been to trump, who said that money has been given.

Another thing to consider is that someone might be making it really difficult legislatively to send the money in time. Political interference. I have my opinion on which side would be the culprit but you likely view it from the opposite angle and I won't change your mind",2025-02-03T14:45:17

Why would Putin make a deal now when he has all the momentum?

Trump thinks that democracies are for suckers and that real 'powerful' countries (by his definition) are more nimble, having just one divine genius at the helm.

Ukraine is not going to give up Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk; and they are not going to accept a peace without the option to join NATO and the EU in the near term.

Russia is now pot committed to conquering Ukraine and incorporating it (and the rest of Eastern Europe) into its sphere of control.

Poland, Romania, and the Baltics nations know that they must have a weakened Russia in order to guarantee their security for the rest of the century... and the Ukraine conflict has been the best vehicle to make that happen.

The rest of NATO can see the writing on the wall that the Ukraine conflict allows them to bleed Russia and reduce its risk to the alliance over the next century.  In essence letting out the pressure of a World War 3.",2025-01-21T16:42:48

As in, they were too lax with their reporting and receipts of high rollers. Trump was never personally in trouble for money laundering, nor did I see any crimes prosecuted against individuals using the Taj Mahal for money laundering in my quick search.

[From a 1998 settlement announcement by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-announces-penalty-against-trump-taj-mahal-associates):

&gt;The BSA requires casinos and other financial institutions to file reports of cash transactions in excess of $10,000 and to institute preventive compliance programs to safeguard against abuse of its financial services by casino customers.

and

&gt;The violations are based on failures to file Currency Transaction Report by Casino forms (CTRCs) within the time period prescribed by the BSA.

They even note:

&gt;Settlement of the final penalty amount was influenced by TTMA’s otherwise laudable BSA compliance programs and its cooperation with Treasury Department Officials during the casino’s IRS examination and final settlement of the matter with FinCEN.

I don't think Trump has ever been directly charged with or investigated for money laundering, which why would he? He's not taking in money from under-the-table criminal enterprises. But it certainly seems his habit of helping others launder money is old and well-engrained. He's done it with properties as well, helping criminals move money around buying and selling his properties at crazy-inflated prices. 

There are few, if any, organizations Trump has touched that come out uncorrupted. How much money is he going to make this term bilking the taxpayers for room-and-board for the Secret Service every time he stays at one of his tacky resorts? Says he wants Greenland, but I'm unconvinced he won't impulsively try to sell Alaska back to Russia or California to Mexico. He doesn't care about sovereignty, he's an increasingly senile career criminal whose brain works exclusively via zero-sum transaction. Sorry for the rant, just didn't want to seem like I'm defending the guy.",2025-01-13T22:43:18

The MeidasTouchNetwork on YouTube (a network of channels started by three Meiselas brothers, including one lawyer, lots of interesting guests and hosts and cohosts with legal and other relevant knowledge) has been giving clips of that. 

Denmark and Canada are NATO members, so that should be interesting if he tries to get what he wants with the military. The responses have been both firm and hilarious at the same time. Denmark changed the Royal coat of arms to feature the symbol for Greenland more prominently. Canada has been suggesting that they should acquire Alaska and some other states as new provinces. Mexico tried to explain to Donald about tariffs and what they actually do and how retaliatory tariffs work. Panama seems to be considering banning the US from using the Panama Canal... Nobody seems interested in renaming the Gulf of Mexico ""the Gulf of America"". 

Danish media found out that Don Jr's photo op with Greenlanders wearing MAGA hats was done by promising a free meal to some homeless people.  Don't know how many spoke or read English or if an interpreter was provided. Or if they cared. It was like having to listen to the Salvation Army spiel before getting free food. 

Also fun is watching Biden Trump-proofing so many things before Jan 20. Don't know if the regular media has been covering it, but his efforts get mentioned sometimes on the MeidasTouchNetwork. It's like toddler-proofing your house before a visit from rowdy grandchildren.",2025-01-14T03:30:26

On the flip side, he might also be seeing the money being made sending weapons to Ukraine and the resources he could access to if he relations stay simpatico.

First, good job avoid the hypocrisy you've shown thus far. It's not lost on anyone.


Two, just like many words of the English language, homonyms being an extreme example, words have different meanings in different connotations. In this case, liberal weird was something kind of worn with pride, meaning unique or different. 


Now conservative weird, a.k.a couch fucking weird, is a bit less nuanced than that. It's more of the negative odd versus unique odd as conservatives tend to project they are the norm, the basis of civilization. Being weird certainly seems to rustle their jimmies.",2025-01-14T07:21:32

That's not intended to be an insult, but rather that he has a low IQ and has difficulty taking in information that contradicts his bias. There were frequent reports in his first administration that he simply doesn't read and that all his briefings had to be verbal and reduced to 3 bullet points else Trump's eyes would glaze over and nothing said would penetrate his stupid numb brain. 

Then there was the famous comment ""I'm president and you're not"" that he used several times in various interviews in 2018, one to ""60 Minutes"". This is what a 14 year old would say to win an argument and is frankly embarrassing to hear from a President's mouth.

The danger with Trump is that he has siloed himself from accurate data outside his habitual GOP newsfeed. He will simply ignore anything critical or contradictory to his morning bowel movement brainstorms. Having achieved his second term he will now trust his malign instincts more than in his first term - so nothing but chaos for the next 4 years.

Which, sadly, is just fine for the media. Trump controversy has been a gold mine for them and as much as Dems might not like to hear it, Dem websites of choice chum the waters with bullsh*t controversy as much as GOP sites.

Genocide does not require a specific number killed for good rrason. It really is just the attempt + the actions. Also not a single person even needs to die for it to be genocide, mass sterilization or forceful family separation are also genocide. A genocide can consist of 0 murders.

The common understanding that genoice is when the holocaust is complete is an impossible standard. Especially because we consider acts like Kristallnacht to be considered as part of the holocaust genocide, even though st that point the death camps weren't even close to running and a lower percentage of German Jewish people had been murdered compared to Palestinians at that point. Yet for very good reasons we should nto argue as ""genocide was not in the process of happening yet"", it absolutely was part of it.",2025-01-08T15:21:12

That's the motte and Bailey. Sure there are differences, but that doesn't apply here.  genocide can be understood easily as by target, intent and tactics, and does not need the intent to destroy the entire people only part. If it was the goal of the Israeli military to kill exactly 15% of Palestinians, that is still 100% a genocide


&gt;Not every bad thing is the worst possible thing. I mean, was Sherman's March genocide? Was the atomic bomb?

Again motte and Bailey.

The question is does what is happening in Gaza ammpubt to genoice..Given the tactics ans spoken words by officials in power i would say yes it runs dangerously close if not outright confirmed at this point.

The first one is more easily argued against, the latter is a nearly axiomatic.

&gt;I'm sorry but ""the Kahanists said terrible things"" is not enough. We had tons of assholes saying horrific shit about the Vietnamese. We created incredible suffering in the whole region including, yes killing children. Does that mean the Vietnam War was a genocide? If so, then you need a new word to describe, for example, what the Turks did to the Armenians. 

If in the course of the Vietnam War the president, our generals and sec of state began intentionally targeting individuals to be shot on the basis of their ethnicity or nationality then yes.

I plead ignorance on the extent the american military heads did this, if at all. I have not read about it, but I know we had some very unsavory individuals. Who knows, maybe, but I'd need to read it.

What is am saying is that the isreali military and head of state have both positioned themselves and presented themselves as being okay with targeting Palestinians on nationality, they say it's to target enemy combatants but they also say all civilians are to be interpreted as enemy combatants.

Their actions seem to work to destroy st the very least part of Palestinians community as an end goal in that of itself. West Bank settlements, apartheid legal systems, a stated refusal to ant concept of statehood for palestinians, plans for redevelopment, decades of oppression all must be considered here as well for how we determon what the intent of the operation may be.

That's genocide if its the intent to kill or displace palestinias in the WB or Gaza, and you are trying to complicate it where it is not. Intent is always the hardest part to prove with genocide, but bibi and the liqud have certainly tip toed the line at the very least, we must admit this.

&gt;I understand you're coming from a place of caring, but it's really not a good idea to desensitize people to the use of that word. For many, many reasons — some of them have nothing to do with Israel.

I don’t think it’s accurate to say that protest voters changed anything but let’s just go ahead and concede that flawed premise based on nothing. 

Your position is that it was more reasonable to ask that people vote in support of a party that was enabling a genocide than to expect that the party might make the tiniest effort to condemn and end a genocide and actually represent the will of their voters? Unless maybe you think the voters actually like seeing what Israel was/is doing?

Some people believe that the Kremlin retaliated by showing Melania’s nude pics. And they cite this information to state that Trump was being more egotistical. 

Now, if that’s how things are, then we wouldn’t see all these flagrant attacks by Russia and China. In addition, Putin has finally demonstrated that hypersonic missile. The thing about those missiles is that they are probably using thousands of computer chips, and Putin is currently sanctioned by the CHIPS Act, so he has to build so many more facilities to produce the chips. The CHIPS Act is hard to repeal, although not impossible. That would mean every House Republican would need to get on board and that’s not exactly an easy thing to do, unless Trump plans to press any Republicans who oppose. But of course, Putin launched this after the nude photos, so he knows it’s in the bag. 

And the biggest issue by far is that Trump plans to gut the DOJ, so that means people exporting semiconductor fabrication equipment will be so much less likely to get investigated and prosecuted. If anything, Putin already has insiders ready to export as soon as Trump gets into power. Missiles will absolutely demolish and destroy Ukraine.

Unprofessional soldiers and an inability to make much in the way of any major military gains for some time. Pretty much a stalemate right now and far too many people being killed and maimed. I would offer Ukraine all the arms they require for the duration of the year. If they are unable to turn the tide in this war I believe that would be the time to negotiate.

The DPRK has never had the military, economic and political power internationally the Russians have had otherwise they may well have tried to take South Korea at some point.

""President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible,"" Trump said during his remarks at Turning Point's America Fest convention. ""So we have to wait for this, but we have to end that war. That war is horrible, horrible.""

Trump, who is set to return to the White House in January, previously said on the campaign trail that if elected, he could end the war ""in 24 hours."" The president-elect recently criticized the policy change by President Joe Biden that allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russian territory.

The president-elect also recently said Ukraine will ""possibly"" receive less military aid once he takes office. Ukraine is heavily reliant on its international partners for military, financial and humanitarian aid that enables it to continue functioning as a state, and fighting Russia after almost three years of war. 

""The number of soldiers being killed..."" Trump said Sunday. ""It's a flat plane, and the bullets are going and there's powerful bullets, powerful guns, and the only thing that's going to stop them is a human body.""

Earlier this month, Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris along with French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. After the meeting, Trump called for an ""immediate ceasefire"".",2024-12-22T20:10:19

Back in January 2022 there were virtually zero US analysts expecting Ukraine to withstand a full Russian invasion. Everyone predicted Zelensky would be dead in a few weeks and the best path forward was guerrilla warfare through underground resistance groups. Now they have the best ground-based military force in Europe. 

Ukraine hoped for a different outcome in the US presidential elections but they always needed an endgame relatively soon so they don’t deplete an entire generation of their own peoples. There will likely be a ceasefire deal soon. 

While US support will evaporate, it’s hard to imagine the Europeans, especially the Polish, won’t act against any further Russian aggression, which is clearly Putin’s goal.",2024-12-02T18:28:51

The Russian elite is not so dumb and reckless that they would openly attack American troops like this.

I am not an apologist for Russia by any means, but the idea that they want to take over Eastern Europe (again) is not supported by any evidence, nor do they possess the capability to take and hold those countries longterm even if they wanted to.

It has enormous agricultural, mineral (in particular rare earth metals) and fossil fuel resources. The Russian navy is based in the Black Sea and Crimea has historically been of great strategic importance to them. It is the natural geographic path for overland shipping and pipelines to Europe. They did not want another NATO country on their border with missiles and other weapons systems stationed on their doorstep. A democratic Ukraine is a threat to the Russian oligarchy. And it has many ethnic Russians and Russian speakers and was part of the USSR until 1991. Ukraine is geostrategically a very important piece of territory - that's one of the reasons the US and Europe have tried so hard to pull them out of the Russian orbit ever since the USSR collapsed and particularly since 2008 when their future NATO membership was discussed.

It is not naive at all to think they won't do this - it's just common sense. Putin is ruthless and amoral but he isn't stupid. He's not going to start WW3 over Poland. 

A major reason Putin attacked Ukraine when he did was that they had not yet joined NATO. He wouldn't have dared had they belonged to the alliance. Why do you think he's complained so much for so long about NATO expansion? It's because attacking countries that join is then off the table as a realistic course of action.

Russia will certainly continue its covert support for rightwing, pro-Russian regimes throughout the world, however. That's actually far more of a threat than them invading more countries. Just look how successful it has been for them backing Trump.",2024-12-02T02:37:24

No. Did we provide permission for them to shoot deep into Russia? No. Did the United States provide them the armored capabilities they needed? We gave 31 tanks. Thirty-one tanks is not even a battalion in the United States army. So, they talk about it, but it didn't really happen.

&gt; 
&gt; Fox News regular and retired Army Lt. General Keith Kellogg has been nominated to be Trump's special envoy to the countries. He previously served as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence and acted as chief of staff of the National Security Council, as reported by the Associated Press.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I am very pleased to nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Keith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration. He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; The highly decorated retired general has previously advised Trump on strategies in the region. Kellogg presented a plan involving peace talks and a ceasefire back in June, as reported by Reuters. However the plan notably left current battle lines in place, leaving Russia in control of much of Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; The president-elect has criticized the large amounts of aid given to Ukraine in the past, leading Ukrainian leaders and supporters to worry that Trump would cease or reduce supplies for their war effort.
&gt; 
&gt; However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared less worried following a call with Trump and Elon Musk earlier this month, where they reportedly pledged their support to Ukraine.
&gt; 
&gt; Kellogg marks the fourth former Fox News contributor to be added to the administration, after presenter Pete Hegseth was nominated for secretary of defense and contributor and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was nominated to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.
&gt; 
&gt; Trump also nominated Fox News host and former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy to serve as the secretary for the Department of Transportation, as reported by CNN.

He’s going to try to cut them off from their access to our intelligence and surveillance apparatus. Our tactical intelligence and support, not to mention our training and the assistance of our expert strategists, analysts, logisticians, and training professionals who have been helping Ukraine run their war. 

I think people underestimate how valuable that assistance is. It’s hard to state. We have effectively helped raise Ukraine up to a world-class professional military in terms of their performance by giving them access to our intelligence tech and the wealth of knowledge our military has accrued from keeping tabs on Russia for 80 years. Ukraine has learned a lot and will be able to fight on very well on their own now, but it would still be another devastating blow for them to lose access to that behind the scenes assistance. It would probably be the only thing at this stage that could produce the advantage necessary Putin needs to try to take Ukraine once and for all.",2024-11-20T05:44:55

If Allies don't control Kyiv, then it would flat out reject any Trump plan, ans insist on its own even if it has to fight without US support. That will prove independence. But, since it is not, it won't ever happen. It will comply with whatever the US decides. Unfortunately for Kyiv, it simply has no leverage and no choice.",2024-11-15T22:50:25

She had a few seizures caused by some viruses when she was little. My mother also had a very difficult pregnancy with her where people were disturbing her a lot and thinks that's what did it. She did a self-test that came out showing that she had it and she told me about it feeling a little defeated. I had to reassure her that she was just as valuable as any other person.

&gt; If you want to do well by her, you should be more involved in adding structure

Absolutely, but check this out. Now that she's become far more aware of things, she's starting to dive into negative overthinking of the state of the world, how government could affect her, etc. She's a HUGE overthinker of the worst case scenario, so I've had to tell her to lay off reading the news and to just wait for me to tell her if there's something she should actually be afraid of as I have more time to keep informed, but what I don't like is that she's now seeing the world through my eyes and my judgment, and despite me being informed politically, I hate politics with a passion so I don't want to tell people who I vote for. I want her to think for herself so I just say what both sides are saying and let her decide, but again, she's going by my life experience. 

Many people are reliant on someone else to decide who to vote for and that is inherently flawed, yet, at the same time, people don't have the capacity to inform themselves. 

Does our current political infrastructure work? Can it work? Can it work for the long term before public opinion devolves itself? Can one person change the entire system? 

I worked in government agencies and the degree of corruption that I saw was deeply rooted all the way down to the lowest level employees. 

Our current make up is flawed to the core as it puts financial success and the most amount of leisure as the peak of achieving success as it demands a cost in terms of suffering, environment, cheap labour, etc..",2024-11-12T04:02:58

Honestly, it set the tone. Putin has no reason to befriend Trump right now; he has every advantage. Trump's promises of isolationism and peace mean that he has to pursue those ends *no matter how unreasonable Putin might be*, and from Putin's perspective, he wants Trump to know that. 

Recall that Putin is the same guy who spent 2008-2020 ordering hits throughout Europe, poisoning other heads of state poisoned, throwing people out of windows in Russia, all while making virtually NO attempt to cover it up. People knowing that he's in control is part of what gives him power in and out of Russia. 

He wants Trump to know that he thinks Trump is a bitch. He wants Trump to spend the next 2 months sweating how he's going to get out of this situation with any semblance of dignity or authority. That way, when Putin says he wants a NATO resolution that Ukraine is never allowed in and that he wants all the territory east of Kyiv, Trump will have to say ""yes sir"".",2024-11-11T20:55:19

The headline alone — ‘Putin Gives Trump Massive Middle Finger’ — screams sensationalism. If you’re trying to report on geopolitics, maybe skip the WWE promo-level language. It feels more like an opinion piece designed to rile people up than actual reporting.

It also relies heavily on secondary sources (NBC News, Washington Post, etc.) without offering any unique insights or firsthand information. It’s basically just a regurgitation of other articles, which makes it feel redundant. On top of that, they don’t even link to the original statements or data, so ‘trust me bro’ is the real source.

The biggest issue, though, is how one-sided it is. It paints Trump and Putin as cartoonish villains without including any neutral or alternative perspectives. Like, even if you’re anti-Trump, you should want balanced reporting to actually understand the full picture. Contrast that with something like Politico’s take on Trump’s comments about Putin being ‘genius’ — they include quotes, context, and leave the editorializing to the readers.

If you’re looking for actual analysis of U.S.-Russia relations and Ukraine, this isn’t it. It’s just red meat for people who already agree with the author. Feels lazy.",2024-11-11T16:58:09

&gt;""You fail to realize the most important thing. We can spit on what you're thinking. We could spit on your plans. We could spit on what you're begging for. We won't enter into any agreement with you. *We will destroy you, destroy you.*

&gt;We couldn't care less whether they are ready or not [for peaceful negotiation to end the conflict] Either way, we will finish off this scum. It's over, they are not to be talked about.

That's the beginning and end of it; the Republicans have a disproportionate amount of power in this country and have spent generations using underhanded tactics to prevent the Democratic party from making any serious or long-term progress while using fear tactics to rally votes from the lesser-educated rural areas.

With that party marching the country towards ""righteous fascism"" since the Civil Rights Movement and unbiased reporting of the realities of the Vietnam War first kicked them in the teeth &amp; disrupted the functional white supremacist Christo-""not fascist"" regime they had going in on in the background.

Unfortunately, for the US to actually get involved, Congress needs to collectively agree to declare war and our current house is being held up by the aforementioned conservative party that holds slight majority, using that to stall any progress on basically everything, and has been repeatedly found to be found to have direct ties with Russia at least since Trump first started running for office (though potentially since the collapse of the Soviet Union as every former R. president has been exceedingly lenient with Russia in spite of other acts of aggression against former Soviet states.

Not only is this likely the case, but all of their ""latest gen"" shit they've been touting as equal to US arms is 35+ years out of date by actual US standards.

To add to the things you mentioned, their newest Su-57 ""stealth"" fighter (first flown in 2010; entered production in 2019 &amp; service in 2020) that was allegedly on par with the F22 (tested in 1997; in service since 2005; currently discontinued for the F35) has been relegated to firing long range missiles across the border from miles within Russian territory &amp; Western radars are proving the claims of it's comparability to the F22 to be exceedingly inaccurate. 

Sukhoi cheered when they announced that they reduced the Su-27's radar signature from 10-15m^2 to an average of 0.1-1m^2 with the Su-57, but the F22's is allegedly 0.0001m^2 from certain angles (mostly head on). 

&gt; Mostly I'm just pissed off that Ukrainian people are being slaughtered

Same. I aged out of the ground troops, but have a few more years to get back into shape for the air force &amp; can fly a drone and operate a stick/throttle/rudder setup thanks to years of flight-sim practice.

He isn’t smart. He was born rich, and money makes money. He didn’t invent electric cars, he bought the company that did. He isn’t a rocket scientist, he bought a company that makes rockets. He’s simply a mediocre businessman born into extreme wealth, that got lucky on one or two random investments. 

Have you heard the man talk? 

The only people who consider themselves to be the “smartest people in the room” are narcissistic douchebags that have no potential for growth. 

You know who the “smartest man in the room” was? Einstein. And he didn’t give a FUCK about money. He gave a fuck about humanity.",2024-11-09T06:34:52

First off, Elon does get a little credit. 
Elon is above average or at least has higher than average skills in leadership (though I wouldn’t say it’s my style of leadership). I mean he gets people organized to get shit done. But… 
His style is to go after something he’s passionate about and trial and error it.

But you cannot trial and error government willy nilly. 

He’s so rich that he can ignore mistakes because he just pays it away. But not when you’re dealing with the other countries and policies that will affect people for years to come. 

And I’m afraid he’s thinking he is a singular genius now due to the sycophants around him.

Fascism is right-wing because it involves extreme nationalism and a strict social hierarchy. Meanwhile, communism advocates for the elimination of social and national distinctions. Conservatives absolutely want to increase government control over individuals and is deeply rooted in the absolutism of early modern Europe. That absolutism bleeds into the totalitarian nature of fascism and right-wing ideologies more generally. It’s really very interesting, if not a little terrifying.

Let me begin by saying something journalists probably ought to say more regularly. I don't know. However, my instincts are as follows. 

\- Trump is self-evidently pro-Israel. You will recall he was the president who caved to longstanding campaign to move the US embassy to Jersualem. And he was an architect of the Abraham Accords which sought to marginalise the Palestinian question in favour of a wider geostrategic realignment against Iran and which was supposed to be Bibi Netanyahu's signature foreign policy achievement when it was unveiled in the Rose Garden. 

  
HOWEVER, Trump is guided by nothing if not self-interest and has no deeper or more abiding instinct than his opposition to costly foreign entanglements. He may be more anti-that than he is pro-Israel in relation to the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. He also has a complex relationship with Netanyahu who was one of the early world leaders to welcome Biden's victory back in 2020. There is a third, newer dimension to the question too, which is that Trump won, and, in his victory speech, celebrated winning, a lot of Arab and Muslim votes this week.

For that reason I can envisage a situation where he tells Netanyahu it's time to wrap up the conflict - he won't quibble with the underlying goals or the notion of Israel's right to self defence but may well tell him to hasten its resolution. 

I'll leave the other bits to my esteemed colleagues.",2024-11-07T18:11:24

He's not following through on all his promises true because half of them are rhetorical or just a bit of bluster. Americans were happier under Trump than any president in decades. 

He has not said he is banning abortion either and Roe vs Wade, while it achieved something I support (abortion), it did it in the wrong way.

Hard-right conservatives  are in favour of displaying American military strength, particularly as regards China, and the strongly pro-Israel elements in the Republican party are advocating full-blown support for Binyamin Netanyahu and the War on Gaza. But then there's the ""American First"" lobby, not to say the outright conspiracy theory wing led by Tucker Carlson, who want Trump to ""end the endless wars"" and focus on domestic politics. The latter seem to have won out with Ukraine, if he really does do the deal he has promised with Putin. But in the Middle East and Far East, the contradiction could easily lead to dangerous miscalculation. If China thinks that Trump isn't committed to defending Taiwan, that would put America's traditional policy in the Pacific in a dangerous quandary. Trump was asked about this and he said ""I'm crazy, so Xi Jinping wouldn't dare."" Is that really a sustainable policy for an American president?

The trouble is we now live in an asymmetric world - America is by far the strongest power, but weaker countries have nuclear weapons. Russia is threatening to use them over Ukraine because Putin regards the fall of his regime as a red line, and that's something he fears from America while America has no balancing fear.   
This leads to the terrible possibility of miscalculating - whether you think that comes from pushing Putin too far or not deterring him hard enough. The threat from Trump is his unpredictability, which makes the chances of miscalculation worse. He says that his unpredictability is an asset - it means that nuclear states  will be cautious about threatening the US and its allies.

During his last presidency, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels imported from China - it didn't do anything to stop Chinese domination of the solar panels industry, where it now has 80 per cent of global manufacturing, but it did cause big lay offs in the US solar panel installation industry for a while as prices went up and sales down.  
China isn't shrugging its shoulders about this threat. Trump's said he would impose 60 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from China, and that would be a big blow. China's economy is struggling a bit at the moment (though its 4-5 per cent growth this year is only bad compared to previous years). However,  China has seen it coming - Biden also raised tariffs, and the threat from Trump was always clear. So it's acted to seek out new markets for its products particularly in South East Asia and Africa. You can see that if you go anywhere outside Europe and America - suddenly you see all these car models you don't know on the roads. Look closely and they are Chinese.  
Whether Trump actually goes ahead I don't really know. It's quite interesting looking at how close Elon Musk has become to Trump. We tend to look at this just through the prism of Twitter/X and the two men's shared love of the limelight - birds of a feather, if you like. But Musk has clear commercial interests here. Tesla has a massive factory in China, and sold $22 billion of cars in China last year. That's big. He regularly meets Chinese leaders - including President Xi and the prime minister, Li Qiang, and has adopted a lot of Chinese talking points, even on topics like Taiwan. Will he end up using his influence with Trump to moderate anti-China rhetoric?

My short answer on the ""do China et al simply shrug their shoulders and raise their prices, knowing we'll pay anyway?"" dimension of your question is: ""no"".

China is at a developmental crossroads - not long ago the question was how much domestic demand for higher quality goods and services could substitute the PRC's longstanding reliance on manufacturing/selling consumer goods to foreign markets. While there is no doubt that the Chinese middle class has already changed the country's political economy, in recent years, because of Covid and a property market crash, policymakers have reluctantly had to depend more than they might have wished on exports.

But I think the ""deals"" he will try to strike could be very destabilising and realign regional balances of power in ways that are very unpredictable. A good example - though very technical - is when he tried to do a deal with President Erdogan of Turkey during his last presidency about America's support for the Kurds in north-east Syria. Suddenly a complex situation which had a simple purpose - building an alliance of forces against Islamic State - suddenly got a whole lot worse. There was a brief war inside Syria between Turkey and the Kurds, US troops were stuck in the middle, Russia came in as a mediator and suddenly you had Russian and American troops squaring up in a remote part of the Syrian desert. It sounds like something you wouldn't make up in the craziest war movie, but it happened.   
Eventually things calmed down, but imagine something similar happening on one of the current conflict lines in the Middle East, or in the Far East...  
As for Israel - this is a really big question. What is Trump's bottom line for US support for Israel? Will he support an expansion of the war to Iran? Again, my feeling is that there is a bottom line, but the idea that there isn't could make the war worse. Of course, as some have suggested, if he really did tell Netanyahu to stop the war Netanyahu would listen to him more than he does to Biden - but whether there would be any incentive to find a longer term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another matter.

My defensive view on behalf of my noble US colleagues - which you are free to disagree with - is that we only know about half of what the 45th and 47th POTUS has done during his many decades in public life because of their doggedness and dedication.",2024-11-07T18:43:25

Am I allowed to be solipsistic and start with Britain? Under the administration of our former PM Tony Blair, Alistair Campbell, his in/famous spin doctor, memorably said ""We don't do God"". It was a remark which spoke to the mismatch between a) Blair's profoundly felt Catholicism on one hand and b) his aversion to discussing religion on the other. This which was itself a result of Britain's growing secularisation - a trend with has only accelerated since.

Trump's situation in some ways resembles the opposite of  the above. He is not a conventional Christian or conservative - nobody would accuse him of that -  but he has consciously and effectively used God, prior to and during this campaign. Meanwhile fewer Americans believe in God than they once did but faith continues to feature front and centre of your great republic's national life.

The big recent development seems to be the sheer explicitness with which Trump has cloaked his survival of an assassination attempt in religious language - which, by the way, I am not for a moment saying is not sincere.

In 2016, Trump's alliance with the conservative / religious right was one of the big stories - I hope you hold me to account on this, as we are only a couple days after the contest, but my sense is this contest won't be defined by that, but rather the way Trump has deepened and broadened his coalition beyond its 2016 complexion.",2024-11-07T18:34:20

I wrote a piece about a big new port China has built in Peru (https://www.thetimes.com/article/f6af8025-d5c7-4468-bcb3-b703f2b30e1d) which will directly compete with ports on the US Pacific coast for dominance of Asia to Latin America trade routes. A lot of people thought this would trigger a reawakening of American interest in what it's always regarded as its own back yard - particularly given the possibility the port could in emergencies become a Chinese naval base (unclear whether that would actually happen, but the very idea of it has worried US military strategists).  
But then when a tender went out for another port earlier this year, two Chinese firms bid to build that too, and not a single American one.  
China is also building strong relations with Brazil, South America's biggest country. It's really quite striking.

From where I look,  social media is certainly taking over a lot of the discourse - whether Instagram pix or serious debate on Twitter or forums like Reddit - but most people are aware that these are places for discussion, however wild, banter and stirring things up, not for calm consieration of facts. Legacy media have come back into the game for those prepared to pay for what used to be called derisively ""gatekeeping"". On your side of the Atlantic (assuming you're American) for all its critics the New York Times has ten million paying subscribers. That's ten times the number it had when it was just a print product. Fox news remains a big influence on voters, clearly.  
What I do see as  happening from my side of the Atlantic is that audiences are becoming more polarised in America as they already were in Britain. Papers in the US used to be city-wide - New York Times, Baltimore Sun or whatever. That model's not sustainable in an internet world. Now the papers are trying to define themselves for bigger markets - but are being attacked by the left for not being left enough and the right for not being right enough, but everyone agrees they are biased (but for opposite reasons). It's a tough situation.  
In Britain, papers have always been politically aligned so it's easier for us. The BBC, though, is in exactly the same position as the NYT - assailed from both sides.

There are two problems. One is the precedent which always hangs over at least British discussion of war (and not just British I'm sure) - Chamberlain struck a peace deal with Hitler over Czechoslovakia in 1938 and look where that got the world. The fear of appeasement hangs heavy in the debate over what to do about Russia - attempts to meet Putin halfway in the past don't seem to quench his thirst for rebuilding the Russian Empire.  
The second problem is because Trump comes over as erratic it raises the possibility of miscalculation. If his interlocutors think he is going to give them a big concession in return for a deal, they can then become more, not less, assertive in pursuing their goals. That is, arguably, what happened in Afghanistan, where Trump's ""peace deal"" with the Taliban left them far more sure than before that they could just take the whole country by force, which they did once Trump was out of office. America was then forced to escalate, and then decided to pull out. It was all a bit of a mess.  
Of course, it's possible that he really might strike a decent deal. But again, would he be looking at the small print? That's where the devil often is, and is he a small print person?

I'd love to know what they think.  
t's a difficult one - it could be the defining issue of the next few years if people on all sides get their calculations wrong.  
Taiwan is clearly nervous that Trump might either pull back from support for Taiwan (in keeping with ""America First"" and its dislike of ""foreign wars""); or that he might strike some sort of deal with President Xi which leaves the island exposed. There's also the possibility that he might turn against Taiwan's semiconductor industry, which is so vital both economically but also as  ""roadblock"" to conflict given how important it is to China too. It's just the sort of industry Trump and Vance would want to ""reshore"" to America. That would leave Taiwan very vulnerable.  
My feeling though is that at the end of the day Trump knows that the build up of forces on either side in the Pacific is dangerous and has to be managed carefully, and he will realise it would take too much of his attention, on a topic that isn't his first concern, if he decided to do anything to really stir things up. If I were in his shoes, I'd say I had a lot to be getting on with making America great again, and the conventional deterrence policy in the Pacific has worked so far, and leave it at that. One of the ""MAGA-friendly"" policy wonks in Trump's orbit - Eldridge Colby, and there's rumours he might get a job in the administration though I've no idea whether they are true or not - has said some very hardline things about China. But when you look closely, they are far more in line with conventional thinking than they look at first.

That may be over-optimistic. We are in unknown territory, after all, this time round - many of the conventional hardline Republicans like Mike Pompeo became disillusioned with him first time round and probably won't work for him again, so we will probably have a fairly untested team around him.

Marx never used the term and Engels only used it once. Later thinkers would develop the concept into an explanation for why workers appear to form ideological commitments that go against their class interest. 

Unfortunately this idea is completely wrong. In the German ideology Marx and Engels make clear that ideological developments only arise in correspondence with material developments. To put it differently, every ideology has a material basis. 

Marx and Engels discuss in their private letters that it is possible and natural for workers to become bourgeois-ified. By being included in the benefits of the surplus labor extraction process, workers are turned into both the victim and perpetrator. 

You are wrong, workers are not the majority in America. The majority of people who claim this status are actually bourgeois-ified in the way that Marx and Engels described. Therefore, they have a bourgeois material interest and vote accordingly. This not only explains why this election went the way that it did, but also why your idea of uniting ""all workers"" is historically impossible.

Edit: aside from the ignorance of the other user, the reason that they call you a liberal is because the theory of false consciousness is today championed by the Democratic party. That might seem ridiculous but consider that they are operating on the same principles that you are.

&gt; To off-set this possibility, steps have been taken on both sides of the Atlantic to ""Trump-proof"" support for Ukraine, providing it with enough financial and military assistance so it can continue to resist Russian encroachment in the long term. 

&gt; NATO this summer announced it was establishing a special mission, known as the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), which would be headquartered in Germany. Its creation essentially means that from now on it will be NATO itself, rather than its biggest contributor the United States, that will coordinate training Ukrainian troops and providing military equipment. 

&gt; The Group of 7 – which unites the United States, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan – finalised a $50 billion long-term loan to Ukraine that would be funded largely by the interest on frozen Russian assets in Europe.  

&gt; Outgoing US President Joe Biden has backed up his European allies by pre-empting the potential risk of a US withdrawal from the deal should Trump be re-elected by making sure the $20 billion US contribution will start becoming available by the end of the year. Congress has approved five bills on Ukraine assistance since the start of the war worth $175 billion, with $106 billion going directly to the government of Ukraine. At a news conference in Riga in mid-October, James O’Brien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Biden will be “emptying out” the funds the US Congress has earmarked for Ukraine before the end of his term. 


&gt; Although it is not possible for a US president to unilaterally pull the country out of NATO – Congress last year passed a law that such a decision needs Senate approval – Trump’s threat still remains very real as he calls the Alliance's golden rule on mutual defence into question.

TL;DR NATO and the Biden Administration have been formulating a contingency plan that empties out current US funding for Ukraine, while transitioning responsibilities to European powers, who are funding it with frozen Russian assets.",2024-11-06T16:19:38

Certain regions of the world will become uninhabitable, we will likely have a huge refugee crisis as people flee from those regions, and coastal cities will be fucked. 

But much of the first world and ironically most of the biggest polluters will see the least of the effects of climate change. Human civilization will remain and we will not all starve in the 2050’s.

Also grocery prices being high isn’t due to climate change. That’s due to rampant inflation of the last 2 years. Which has slowed.

Ukraine was screwed as soon as it became apparent that the West, including the Biden's government, was dragging their collective feet in supplying Ukraine with more meaningful military aid. Only Poland and the Baltic countries threw all they could, but that wasn't enough because these are small countries with fewer resources than countries such as Germany, France or the UK.  


If Ukraine had, in early 2022,  the weapons they have now, the Russians would have been utterly defeated. Right now, it's too late. Not only is Ukraine going to lose what the Russians occupy at this point, but it will also have no means to lift itself up from the destruction. Any national assets of value, either already are, or will soon be taken over by multinational corporations to pay for the war.

&gt;[DOD DIRECTIVE 5240.01 DOD INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENCE-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE COMPONENT ASSISTANCE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER CIVIL AUTHORITIES](https://www.esd.whs.mil/portals/54/documents/dd/issuances/dodd/524001p.pdf)

&gt;k. The Defense Intelligence Components will only conduct, or provide support for the conduct of, covert activities:

&gt;(1) In times of war declared by Congress;

&gt;(2) During a period covered by a report from the President to Congress in accordance with Public Law 93-148; or

&gt;(3) When such actions have been approved by the President and directed by the Secretary of Defense. l. **No DoD civilian employee or member of the Armed Forces will engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.**

I truly wonder where you absolute buffoons get these hairbrained conspiracies from. IS it fucking infowars? I swear to fucking Odin if it is....

Are you mad law enforcement is allowed to kill people willy nilly? Are you mad law enforcement can barely be held accountable for killing civilians? Are you mad law enforcement has unreasonable power? Are you mad law enforcement has no constitutional duty to protect civilians from harm?

I'm happy you have a long history of ACAB so you can be taken seriously about your complaints about the DOD assisting law enforcement in intelligence operations. What's next? Mad about the FBI surveilling domestic terrorists, antifa, communists, journalists etc. for the past....how many decades have the FBI existed? Mad about the CIA surveilling domestic terrorists, antifa, communists, journalists etc. and assassinating several leaders who dared talk about socialism? (/s)

Boo-fucking-hoo. The US spent decades militarizing it's police force and now that the actual military is allowed to help them people are mad?

&gt;a. Secretary of Defense Approval.

&gt;(1) The Secretary of Defense may approve any type of requested permissible assistance described in Paragraph 3.2.

&gt;(2) The decision to approve requests for these types of permissible assistance described in Paragraph 3.2. to law enforcement agencies and other civil authorities are reserved to the Secretary of Defense: (a) **Provision of personnel to support response efforts for civil disturbances, which may also require Presidential authorization.** (b) DoD response to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive incidents. **(c) Assistance in responding with assets with potential for lethality, or any situation in which it is reasonably foreseeable that providing the requested assistance may involve the use of force that is likely to result in lethal force, including death or serious bodily injury. It also includes all support to civilian law enforcement officials in situations where a confrontation between civilian law enforcement and civilian individuals or groups is reasonably anticipated.** Such use of force must be in accordance with DoDD 5210.56, potentially as further restricted based on the specifics of the requested support.

Wow I'm so glad the critics of this bill spent the past few decades criticizing law enforcements use of unreasonable force against campus protestors, peaceful protestors, antifa, BLM riots etc. Now the army gets to help them. What's next? You gonna tell me the people critical of this directive cares about any of those aforementioned groups? Ha!

Before the meeting began, Trump, standing next to Zelensky, said that it was an “honor” to meet with him and that they had a “very good relationship.” He then added that he also has a “very good relationship” with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Not to mention that having a free and democratic Ukraine – the second-largest country in Europe and a potential powerhouse – that views the US as a major friend and ally would be a truly enormous strategical advantage for us in the region, especially with Turkey's Erdogan being such an unreliable partner lately.

Ignoring the substantial polling that gives him a lead there, including the WSJ poll just now.

Path to victory is, assuming GA, NC and AZ stay red (stay because these are red states), which the current polling indicates, any one of the 3 blue wall states will get him over 270. All 3 according to recent polling are now in danger according to the Quinniapac and Emerson polling last week.

Harris is not competitive in states that traditionally the democratic candidate should be: Florida and Ohio.

By all accounts, this is a defensive election by the Dems, with less of a path to victory than Trump does. In terms of the early vote count that you've mentioned for PA, cannot comment. It made a massive difference last time due to COVID. I doubt it will be more sizable this time.

&gt;For starters, she'll almost certainly win the popular vote. That doesn't always align with the winner of the election. But it does often enough that it's still preferable to be in that position.

While that is what most polls indicate, it's with a much smaller margin than Clinton or Biden, indicating a much tighter race in the swing states, which again should not be encouraging at all. And if it's worse than a 2 point lead, which some polls are indicating: some a tie, some even a Trump lead, then that's terrible for the Harris campaign.",2024-10-12T23:45:33

The idea that we are weak or powerless on any front is ridiculous. Take Israel, for example. (I am not recommending any of the following, just point out it's possible). If we really, really wanted to end the Israel-Arab conflict for good and didn't care about the reverberations, we could do it. What's more, we could do it one of two ways. 

We could join the fray militarily and very easily push non-Israelis out of whatever area we desired. Of course, that's genocide, but it is easily within our power.

We could cut off all aid to Israel. Israel would stumble on for a while, but ultimately would lose just due to numbers and the increasing lack of resources.

The same thing holds true for Ukraine. We could join the Ukrainians (with or without NATO) and push Russia off all Ukrainian territory very quickly -within weeks, possibly days. Or we could cut off aid to Ukraine and they would fall to Russia. It would take more time, but Ukraine would fall. (Which would be a disaster for the West, let alone the Ukrainians.)

Not only could we do either of those, we could do them both. And we could invade Russia simultaneously.

You understand the word “escalation”, right? It doesn’t start with MAD but could spiral into it.

* Russia uses tactical nukes in Ukraine

* US and NATO mount a massive conventional response, eliminating Russian air and air defense forces, supply depots, and troop concentrations

* Ukrainian (and possibly NATO) ground forces go on the offensive

* Russian forces collapse

* Russia itself is now basically defenseless except for its nuclear arsenal

* Putin’s paranoia leads him to believe NATO intends to invade Russia

We salute the people of Ukraine who claimed their right to elect freely their leadership. Their brave stand was a victory for democracy inspiring those throughout the world who yearn for freedom and dignity in the face of tyranny, isolation and oppression. The territorial integrity, security, and political and economic transformation of Ukraine are essential to building a Europe whole, free and at peace.

The invasion of Ukraine had nothing to do with NATO and [everything to do with conquest.](https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/hailing-peter-the-great-putin-draws-parallel-with-mission-to-return-russian-lands)

&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin paid tribute on Thursday to Tsar Peter the Great on the 350th anniversary of his birth, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands.

&gt;“Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia’s),” Putin said after a visiting an exhibition dedicated to the tsar.

&gt;In televised comments on day 106 of his war in Ukraine, he compared Peter’s campaign with the task facing Russia today.

&gt;“Apparently, it also fell to us to return (what is Russia’s) and strengthen (the country). And if we proceed from the fact that these basic values form the basis of our existence, we will certainly succeed in solving the tasks that we face.”

&gt;Putin, now in his 23rd year in power, has repeatedly sought to justify Russia’s actions in Ukraine, where his forces have devastated cities, killed thousands and put millions of people to flight, by propounding a view of history that asserts Ukraine has no real national identity or tradition of statehood.

What about 7000 word essay written by [Putin himself back in 2021](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putin-admits-ukraine-invasion-is-an-imperial-war-to-return-russian-land/)?

&gt;His unapologetically imperialistic attitude toward Russian-Ukrainian relations was laid bare in July 2021 in the form of a 7,000-word essay authored by Putin himself which set out to explain the alleged “historical unity” binding the two nations together. “I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia. For we are one people,” Putin the amateur historian concluded. This bizarre treatise was widely interpreted as a declaration of war against the entire notion of an independent Ukraine and has since been made required reading for all Russian military personnel.",2024-09-19T16:23:36

Hundreds of thousands of lost lives, and hundreds of billions of dollars later, no one is better off — not Europe, not America and certainly not Ukraine.

So let me see if I have this right. Russia was mad that Ukraine wanted to join NATO to protect from Russian aggression, so Russia invaded and proved Ukraine’s point correct. Which violated international law and these chuckleheads want to side with Russia. Is that right?

Where the fuck is Vance, his own VP, in this piece?!

A couple significant points:

-Russia wantonly and savagely invaded Ukraine, a sovereign and democratic nation. 

-Ukraine possesses the right to defend itself and push Russian invaders out while abiding by rules of warfare and it’s important to point out, Russia does not abide by these conventions (bombing indiscriminately, targeting dams, energy infrastructure, etc.)

-Russia benefits substantially from limits imposed by USA/UK/FRA to use weapons only on certain targets and in certain regions.

-Russia consistently escalates to deescalate as a strategy, so the point that we are solely pushing brinksmanship as a practice is, at best, moot; also, what happened to the age-old conservative talking point that we don’t bow or back down in the face of blustering and bellicose adversaries?

-Russia has almost certainly passed crucial ballistic missile technology to both NK and Iran — both of which have likely targeted the US through cyberattacks and/or contributed to Shia Militia Groups’/non-state actor’s attacks on US personnel in the Middle East — for artillery, ballistic missiles, and drones from them.

-To summarize: Russia should not be appeased in this instance; Putin absolutely will continue to destabilize democratic countries in a variety of ways, through foreign influence (propaganda, internet influence ops, cyberattacks) and direct action like sabotage, assassinations, and seizure of sovereign nations (Moldova, Baltics, etc.) — especially if he is rewarded with large parts of Ukraine. Allowing Russia to claim and be rewarded with portions of a sovereign nation will embolden Russia to continue seeking what it believes is owed to it. Russia cannot sustain its current level of support to the conflict in Ukraine over the longer-term (3-5 years) and is pushing hard now to secure as much territory as possible for a more advantageous position in negotiations before the next election; this is not an argument to sustain the bloody conflict in perpetuity, but simply to point out that Russia is pressing it’s advantage currently.

My great-grandparents came to the US in 1908 or so and while they seemed to have assimilated completely, Slovaks in Croatia are considered a national minority. It’s been about 200 since they first arrived and they are still actively celebrating their Slovak heritage and continue to teach Slovak along with Croatian and English in a few schools.

&gt; If Ukraine loses, Putin &amp;quot;Will take further steps,&amp;quot; said Kwiatkowska, a 75-year-old resident of Warsaw whose Ukrainian mother and Polish father met after World War II. She was particularly dismissive of Trump&amp;#039;s claim in Tuesday night&amp;#039;s debate that he could easily end the war.

&gt; &amp;quot;Just empty words,&amp;quot; she scoffed, as she did her morning shopping in Warsaw, a capital that, like cities in Ukraine today, was bombed to near destruction during World War II. S?awomir D?bski, a professor of strategy and international affairs at the College of Europe in Natolin, also found it &amp;quot;Far-fetched&amp;quot; for Trump to claim he could force Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the negotiating table before he even entered the White House.

&gt; With the brutal war in Ukraine, many Poles have soured on the former president, who has a history of admiring comments about Putin.

Poland is stronger than Ukraine. They have better naval/air resources. Better geographic too. But you also have to consider that Ukraine has always lived with the fear of Russia invading them, so they spent a lot of money and time building their military for that purpose. And training their military.

But when you say without NATO. Do you mean like NATO actually fighting or also NATO/US/EU giving them weapons? Because Ukraine wouldn't have had a chance without all the aid packages they have gotten. And I'm pretty sure Poland would also need the same type of support from the world that Ukraine got.",2024-09-18T19:39:27

This was a huge reason why they made the play for Ukraine when they did, it’s likely their last opportunity to do so.
