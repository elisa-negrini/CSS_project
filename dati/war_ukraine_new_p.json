Responding to President Trump’s ultimatum to Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin that he “accept a peace deal with Ukraine within 50 days or face new secondary sanctions,” Rice said, “I think the best news that we could possibly give to the Ukrainian people is that the United States and Europe have finally aligned around the idea that Vladimir Putin will not be stopped with words. He will only be stopped if he believes that he can go no further, he can win no further.” Rice suggested that American and European alignment on handling Russia marks a “turning point” in the Ukraine conflict, raising the prospect of additional weapons deliveries and support for the embattled nation. Rice also discussed the possible challenges of enforcing secondary sanctions on entities doing business with Russia, and shared her view on why it’s not a bad thing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio is jointly serving as National Security Advisor. ",

Charter, and the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council,\" the [Russian](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/russia/) Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\n&gt;The ministry also warned of possible radiological consequences, despite Moscow's own [record](https://kyivindependent.com/months-after-bombing-chornobyl-russia-warns-israeli-strikes-on-iran-risk-nuclear-catastrophe/) of repeatedly placing nuclear facilities at risk during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and threatening to use nuclear weapons.\n\n&gt;Russia and Iran are close strategic partners, with Tehran providing Moscow with ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed attack drones for its war against Ukraine.\n\n&gt;Moscow has diplomatically backed Iran after Israel launched the initial air strikes against Iranian military and nuclear targets on June 13, an operation that sparked further waves of aerial attacks from both sides.",

Then he said Zelensky was a dictator. After Putin had said that. And now Trump suggests that Putin should go for war instead of peace. After Putin made it clear once again he was doing that.\n\nMaybe Trump is trying to at least keep convincing the 48% of the Americans that are happy with his politics, that Putin just is following the suggestions of the Americans when he takes as much of Ukraine as possible and avoids peace. Then they can feel better when watching the news reports from Ukraine, and think that it at least is with the support from America these things happen, and not something that goes against the Strong President’s wishes.\n\nMaybe the 49% that do not support Trump might consider that he as soon as Putin does or says something is quick to express support for it. Putin says he wants peace discussions with Zelensky. When Zelensky turns up Putin refuses. Trump quickly says that he told Putin he has to keep fighting instead, and has ”excellent” discussions with Putin about him having to respond forcefully to the Ukrainians…",

        "body": "Trump is having to come to terms with reality after glorifying and defending Putin for years; desperately hoping for his cooperation in return.\n\nBut because Trump now recognizes that brokering a peace will be far more complicated and difficult than he previously imagined, he's become outraged over the fact that he won't be handed a \"win\" and entitled to some kind of accolade for his feckless efforts.\n\nMake no mistake, Trump cares far more about being awarded for his efforts than he does about actually ending the war.\n\nThat said, Trump promised to end the war on \"day one,\" but during his first call with Putin, they chatted about their \"shared history\" and discussed how Trump could help Putin realize his goals and assist Russia in seizing control of a large chunk of Ukrainian land.\n\nImmediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a \"dictator\"\n\nTrump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies publicly denigrated Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership for weeks, and without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.\n\nTrump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to \"negotiate\" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.\n\nTrump had the gall to call Zelensky a \"dictator without elections,\" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.\n\nThe truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.\n\nEvery \"deal\" he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.\n\nHe even previously called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" \n\nTrump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO. This move would only weaken the alliance; effectively carrying out one of Putin's most ambitious goals for him.\n\nTrump has practically enabled Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.\n\nTrump has defended Putin for years, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a \"killer\" who murders his political opponents.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over abandoned US military outposts.\n\nTrump ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed these forces to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.\n\nAnd let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after he demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are crucial for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.\n\nAnd look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been Putin's personal backscratcher and useful idiot for years, but what's really irritating right now is how Trump cares very little about the war and its ramifications, and is far more concerned about how he can take credit for negotiating a lukewarm deal at best.\n\nHe's desperate to be awarded the title of \"peacemaker,\" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, straining our alliances, and offering up Ukraine's territory to Russia with no real security guarantees in return.\n\nHe'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.\n\nPutin is a dangerous expansionist on a warpath to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.\n\nTrump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, only to later resume a freshly organized and newly equipped \"special military operation\" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.\n\nPutin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.\n\nFor Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, half-hearted and temporary deal is made.",

That's not to say that the war hasn't been helpful to him - it has, since it put many oligarchs into a position where they can no longer choose between the West and Russia. They can no longer stash their assets in the West, so they have no choice but to bend over to Putin even harder.\n\nLast but not least, Russia didn't want either the war in Syria or the war in Ukraine (back in 2014) - they were woefully unprepared for either one, and reacted to unfolding events, rather than orchestrating them.\n\nYou have one thing right though, when this war in Ukraine ends it will be the last war for Putin. He is tired and he is old, and he is going to retire sooner rather than later. The real problem is that Putin is Russia's centrist.

        "body": "One of the last times he called Putin, they chatted about their \"shared history\" and discussed how Trump could help Russia seize control of one-fifth of Ukraine's land. \n\nImmediately after the phone call, Trump began ranting about how this war is Ukraine's fault for not surrendering its territory to Putin. This is also when Trump started insulting Zelensky in public, repeatedly referring to him as a \"dictator\"\n\nTrump also left Ukraine out of peace talks while him and his allies went on for weeks denigrating Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership without uttering one word of rebuke for Putin.\n\nIn fact, the Trump administration conveyed that our European allies were more of a threat to us than Russia, all while Trump was issuing his own threats towards friendly nations and escalating economic and diplomatic tensions between us, our closest trade partners and NATO allies.\n\nTrump likes to say that this war would have never happened under his watch, but he conveniently forgets that he failed to \"negotiate\" a peace during his first term when Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout his entire presidency.\n\nTrump had the gall to call Zelensky a \"dictator without elections,\" ignoring the fact that one, Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections during war time, and more importantly, that Putin—an *actual* dictator—has held on to power for a quarter century through elections that have been widely deemed fraudulent by the international community.\n\nThe truth is, Trump likely helped accelerate this war in the first place.\n\nEvery \"deal* he's tried to negotiate has involved either extorting Zelensky or caving into Putin's demands, and without providing any real specific security guarantees for Ukraine in return.\n\nHe even called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius\" and \"savvy.\" \n\nTrump has also reportedly communicated—on a number of occasions—that he wants to withdraw from NATO entirely. And if you're not aware, weakening NATO is one of Putin's most ambitious goals. \n\nTrump has practically glorified Putin throughout his presidency, even siding with him over our own intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump even suggested that the US partner with Russia on a cyber security task force. It received swift, bipartisan backlash from lawmakers who had to remind Trump that Russia continues to be one of the US's most dangerous cyber security threats.\n\nTrump has defended Putin throughout his presidency, like when he pushed back against claims that Putin is a \"killer\" who murders his political opponents.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump's actions were often seen as favorable to Russia. Trump sought to lift or veto Russian sanctions on multiple occasions. He also aided Russian proxy wars in places like Syria by allowing Russian forces to take over US military outposts that Trump had abandoned.\n\nTrump also effectively ditched our Kurdish allies in northern Syria. The Kurds have fought in more wars alongside US troops than Donald \"bone spurs\" Trump ever has, and by abandoning them in their fight against Russian-backed Syrian forces, he allowed them to move into Kurdish-controlled areas and fill the power void left by Trump's withdrawal.\n\nAnd let's not forget Trump's pause on military aid to Ukraine in 2019 after Trump demanded dirt on Joe Biden from Zelensky. This aid included things like medical supplies, communications gear and defensive weapons like Javelin anti-tank missiles that are a crucial supply for Ukraine's frontline defense against armored threats.\n\nAnd look, I could go on and on about how Trump has been a long-standing ally and useful idiot to Putin, but what's especially concerning right now is how Trump cares next to nothing about \"ending the war\" in Ukraine, and cares far more about getting the credit for it.\n\nHe wants nothing more than to be awarded the title of \"peacemaker,\" and to do it, he'll settle for caving into Putin's demands, weakening our alliances, and offering up a large chunk of Ukraine's territory to Russia with no specific security guarantees in return.\n\nHe'll settle for any measure of peace, which means he'll settle for an imaginary peace.\n\nPutin is a dangerous expansionist on a campaign to reincorporate Russia's old territory. His imperialist ambitions are inspired by a revisionist idea that Russia is destined to become a dominant world superpower and empire. He's also determined to expand his oil operation.\n\nTrump is too incompetent and careless to understand that any overtures of peace from Putin are merely strategic moves meant to give him enough time to recoup and reorganize his forces, all so he can later resume a freshly organized and equipped \"special military operation\" and land grabbing crusade against the territories of Eastern Europe that once belonged on the peripheries of the Russian empire.\n\nPutin has violated practically every deal he's ever made, his imperialist dreams will not be thwarted, as made evident by the fact that he's been waging war against his neighbors ever since he came into power.\n\nFor Putin, this war is *never* over, for Trump, it is over as soon as any iteration of a lazy, amateurish, one-sided, and temporary deal is made.",

But a peace deal on its own, at least ones that are being discussed are not likely to be accepted or pan out. The way I see it here are my thoughts on the matter. \n\nPeace deal, current territorial gains kept, no additional arms or security guarantee: This gives both sides time to recover and re-arm. This does however greatly favour Russia as while their quality of arms may not be equal to the quality that Ukraine has been getting, even with Europe still supplying Ukraine though not as a whole bloc, Russia will likely still have the industry to re-arm at a faster rate especially if they continue receiving arms from China and North Korea. In addition to this, Putin has repeatedly shown that he is willing to ignore agreed upon treaties such as the Minsk agreement by using a combination of propaganda, misinformation and false flag operations. See, literally any other conflict Russia has started since the cold war. Even if US companies set up mining operations they will likely completely bypass these areas or again use false flags and blame Ukraine for any damage/casualties. \n\nAny other peace deal: Russia will never accept a deal which provides Ukraine with security guarantees from the EU/NATO/US. Nor will either side likely accept loss of territory. \n\nMy opinion on the best option: Personally, and I should note I have 0 background in economics or geopolitics, I think the best path to peace is further sanctioning Russia and implementing Tariffs (I know, I know) or sanctions on nations supporting or bypassing sanctions on Russia. This would be done over time to give time to the nations to find other sources for supply like oil. \n\nNegotiate with nations to further undercut Russian prices on resources like oil and gas prior to the above. Lastly, arm Ukraine to the teeth, Supply then with modern arms without restrictions. Russia has stated previously that redlines would lead to military actions on these countries who supplied arms such as f16s, tracks, etc but these have always resulted in nothing. As a safety barrier this can also be done incrementally though it must be at a much faster pace than it is currently. Especially for European nations as it is in their great interest as Russia has historically always been the biggest threat and continues to be. It should also be noted that this can have positive effects for these nations as they get better data on their arms usefulness as well as boosts their economy in the replacement and improvements on these arms. \n\nAgain I am no expert, these are my own thoughts and should not be taken at face value. I am not your general and this is not military advice 😅.\n\nAlso if you read all this guy grab a cookie or something you deserve it.",

You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.”\n\nTrump is so invested in supporting Putin that he can’t even stop talking about Zelensky having started the war when that is not the subject at hand.

Yuri Shvets\n\nFormer Role: KGB major, based in Washington, D.C. in the 1980s.\n\nClaims: Trump was identified as a potential asset in the 1980s. The 1987 Moscow trip was orchestrated by the KGB. Trump’s political actions afterward (e.g. anti-NATO newspaper ads) were seen as successful influence operations by Soviet handlers.\n\nSource: Featured heavily in Craig Unger's American Kompromat.\n\n2. Sergei Zhirnov\n\nFormer Role: KGB officer, trained at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute, now residing in France.\n\nClaims: Trump’s 1987 Moscow trip was a classic KGB recruitment test. Zhirnov says Trump was surveilled during the trip, and Soviet agents sought kompromat (compromising material). He strongly believes Trump was cultivated, if not formally recruited.\n\nMedium: Frequent interviews in French and European media, including \"Opération Trump\" documentary.\n\n\n3. \nAlnur Mussayev\n\nFormer Role: Head of Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee (KNB) in the 1990s.\n\nClaims: Trump was recruited during the 1987 trip and given the codename \"Krasnov\". Mussayev also suggested this was known at the time among KGB and satellite service.\n\n4.\nOleg Kalugin\n\nFormer Role: KGB General and head of foreign counterintelligence (until 1990).\n\nClaims: Kalugin has not claimed direct knowledge of Trump being recruited, but he has repeatedly explained how the KGB targeted and cultivated American businessmen and politicians in long-term operations.\n\nContext: In the 2024 French documentary Opération Trump, Kalugin discussed Soviet influence techniques and acknowledged Trump was a target, though he stopped short of confirming recruitment, but rather said that KGB had compromising material.",

        "body": "In conclusion, the evidence compellingly points to Trump behaving – wittingly or not – like a Manchurian Candidate cultivated by Russia. The convergence of Trump’s actions with Russia’s interests is too consistent to dismiss as random. This realization carries profound implications for U.S. national security. If indeed an American president has been influenced to prioritize a foreign adversary’s agenda, it represents a historic breach in our democracy’s defenses. The checklist below summarizes how Trump’s conduct aligns with known Russian influence tactics. By comparing these side-by-side, it becomes painfully clear that Trump checks nearly every box. It is incumbent on U.S. institutions and the public to recognize these warning signs and ensure that no leader is ever again allowed to advance a hostile nation’s aims under the guise of American policy.\n\nTrump vs. Russian Influence Checklist: (Does Donald Trump’s behavior align with classic signs of foreign influence?)\n\n- Secret Communications with Adversary: Yes. Trump held unusual off-record meetings with Putin (no aides or notes) and had covert calls (Subpoena the Trump-Putin Helsinki Interpreter - The Atlantic) (Trump spoke with Putin multiple times since leaving office, Woodward book reports - POLITICO). Agents of influence often operate clandestinely to hide guidance from their handlers. Trump’s secrecy fits this pattern.\n\n- Praise and Flattery Toward Adversary Leader: Yes. Despite Putin’s aggression, Trump consistently praised Putin as “smart” and “savvy”, rarely if ever criticizing him (Trump condemns Russia invasion; hints again at 2024 presidential run | Reuters). The Kremlin cultivates ego – Trump responded with obsequious admiration, undermining U.S. moral authority.\n\n- Echoing Adversary’s Propaganda/Narratives: Yes. Trump frequently parroted Russian talking points – blaming NATO allies, questioning Ukraine’s legitimacy, denying Russian meddling – often word-for-word what Russian media were saying (Why John Bolton Is Certain Trump Really Wants to Blow Up NATO - POLITICO) (‘Doing Our Job For Us’: Russian State Media Rejoice at Trump’s Putin Embrace - The Moscow Times). This mirrors how an influenced asset amplifies their patron’s message.\n\n- Policy Shifts That Benefit Adversary: Yes. From halting Ukraine aid (Trump halts all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, White House official says | Reuters) to trying to weaken NATO (Why John Bolton Is Certain Trump Really Wants to Blow Up NATO - POLITICO), Trump’s major foreign policy moves have favored Russia’s strategic position. Each aligns with longstanding Kremlin objectives (e.g., dividing the West, dominating Ukraine).\n\n- Dismissal of Own Intelligence &amp; Institutions: Yes. Trump sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence on election interference (Subpoena the Trump-Putin Helsinki Interpreter - The Atlantic), undermined the FBI/counterintelligence probe, and attacked U.S. officials who were tough on Russia. Such distrust in his own agencies serves Russia’s goal of sowing chaos in U.S. decision-making.\n\n- Financial or Personal Vulnerabilities Exploited: Likely yes. While details are murky, Trump’s long history of business entanglements in Russia (and reliance on Russian money in his real estate empire) created clear vulnerabilities. Ex-KGB insiders assert he was “ideally recruitable” due to these greed and ego weaknesses (‘Trump Recruited as Moscow Asset,’ Says Ex-KGB Spy Chief). Kremlin influence operations habitually exploit exactly these soft spots.\n\n- Adversary Praise and Endorsement: Yes. Russian officials and state media openly praise Trump as someone they can work with, far more than any U.S. president in memory (Russia praises Trump and scolds Europe for being the crucible of war | Reuters) (‘Doing Our Job For Us’: Russian State Media Rejoice at Trump’s Putin Embrace - The Moscow Times). Putin himself has lauded Trump’s statements as “business-like.” This positive reinforcement from the adversary is a strong sign the relationship is delivering value to them – in Putin’s case, Trump was literally “doing our job for us,” as one Russian TV host put it (‘Doing Our Job For Us’: Russian State Media Rejoice at Trump’s Putin Embrace - The Moscow Times).\n\n- Isolation from Allied Input: Yes. Trump repeatedly ignored or belittled U.S. allies (from NATO leaders to Ukraine’s president) while engaging Putin one-on-one (Putin-Trump meeting is possible this month but may be later, Kremlin says | Reuters) (Trump halts all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, White House official says | Reuters). Cutting off allied advice while favoring the adversary’s counsel is a red flag in influence assessments. Trump’s approach left U.S. allies aghast and Moscow jubilant.\n\nEvery warning sign on this checklist applies to Donald Trump. Taken together, they reveal a deeply troubling pattern: a U.S. President whose words, deeds, and policies have aligned—again and again—with Russian interests. If every clue points in the same direction, what are we afraid to admit, or even ask? The label Manchurian Candidate may seem provocative, but history reminds us that the most dangerous betrayals are often dismissed as unthinkable—until they are not.\n\nHistory may not repeat itself, but it rhymes. And in this moment, the music is deafening. The only question left is whether we will continue to hum along—or change the tune.",

They're attacking our election systems, installing cronies at the highest levels of government, deporting legal immigrants, making it harder for women to vote, making it impossible for trans people to get a passport, dismantling LGBT protections, destroying our social safety net, setting up extrajudicial death camps, crashing the economy, and destabilizing the U.S dollar. \n\nI don't have a car to get to protests near me, I live in a rural area so there's no public transportation, I've been without work for three months, and I think that my only real option is to leave the U.S and claim asylum in a sympathetic country before the borders are closed. \n\nThey're already working on closing off the U.S/Mexico border. I wonder how long before they do the same to the Canadian border and then air travel? \n\nAlso Trump is planning on invoking the Insurrection Act on April 20th. The order was signed on January 20th, you should definitely give it a read.\n\nhttps://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-may-impose-martial-law-type-order-on-april-20-what-we-know-8162828",

He could have that every Sunday in a church, but he never goes there. So for Trump, the reason he picks a pastor without following through is probably because it's the easiest way to make a show of it without actually doing anything, although obviously that doesn't really address what you're saying; even if Trump's not one of them, for a lot of people in the modern world, spirituality *is* more than just for show.",

In fact I'm convinced that your position is correct that there is no evidence and that I would never find any anyway, and since knowing that now, I have come to the conclusion that America deserves only the worst that Donald Trump can deliver. The American people should be chastised by the authoritarian fascist leader for all of the rest of his life and his son should become the president of the United States after he is gone. And I do sincerely hope that all those that go against Donnie Jr will end up in some sort of prison that would once be deemed as illegal. I hope that all the foreigners from America that came here looking for hope Will be chastised by this administration because America deserves it and so do the people that would ever want to come here. Elon musk couldn't have possibly done what Donald Trump was insinuating which was remarkably similar to what Elon did whenever he took over government agencies how silly of me. Now we can bow our heads and pray. Dear Jesus make Donald Trump's wrath the worst that it can possibly be of biblical proportions. Allow him the most power that one can be granted so that he may scald the Americans for voting for him. Amen",

And unless it's a die hard and principled libertarian I never hear talk about American freedom from standard American conservatives.\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\nMy mom is German and pacifist, and got into a political argument with my sister's ex's brother about the Iraq war. He was in the military. Months later we were at their family's place for the 4th, and his aunt kept on trying to provoke my mother. For example talking about how she is a lesbian in a weirdly aggressive manner, (my mother obviously has no problem with that), and other freedom adjacent topics. And at some point she got up frustrated since she couldn't provoke my mother, and out of the blue said, \"well if you hate america so much you should go back where your from\". \n\n\nAnother time my mother was at an airport MacDonald's around the time when most European countries said they wouldn't join in the Iraq war, and order French fries. When they were ready to be picked up, the worker came \"threw\" them at her, and said to her aggressively, \"here are your freedom fries!\" My mother hadn't spoken with them except to order.

So he basically takes credit for work already done or takes credit for just turning back to the status quo that he stopped. Trump admin claims they are impartial and not pro-russian because they are sending weapons to Ukraine (even though at a reduced rate than before and generally disrupting Ukraine).\n\n3) Trump admin appeases Putin on a \"middle\" ground - they agree to not send weapons but will keep intel or vice versa. Net effect is still Ukraine is worse off than they were a few weeks ago while Trump admin claims victory over ceasefire as if it is some grand success.",

Excerpt:\n\n&gt; Now, with Russia’s military again grinding its way forward, the Trump administration has halted weapons deliveries and intelligence sharing that have been critical to Ukraine’s resistance against a three-year invasion by its giant neighbor that has killed tens of thousands and razed dozens of cities.\n\n&gt; The impact of the halt—which U.S. officials described as a temporary pause designed to force Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to negotiate with Russia—will be limited at first, but is likely to grow over time as Ukraine’s stocks of U.S. ammunition run down, and weapons systems cannot be repaired or replaced, officials and analysts said. \n\n&gt; The main immediate impact will be felt from the cutoff of intelligence, which will constrain Ukraine’s ability to accurately target long-range strikes to knock out Russian troops and equipment before they reach the battlefield. On Friday, Maxar Technologies said that the U.S. has cut off Ukrainian access to the satellite images that the company supplies through an American government program—imagery used by Ukrainian forces to plan and mount operations, particularly using explosive drones.\n\n&gt; A lack of fresh arms deliveries will take longer to have an impact but the effect would be broader. A dwindling stock of long-range air-defense missiles would erode Ukraine’s ability to intercept Russian ballistic missiles targeting cities. A lack of spares could see its top-performing infantry fighting vehicles and howitzers fall out of use. Although the immediate reaction from front-line soldiers was one of weary resilience, morale is likely to suffer as the withdrawal of support from Ukraine’s main backer saps confidence.",

While SAMP/T has specific limitations in anti-tactical ballistic missile (ATBM) engagements due to the constraints of its Arabel 3D radar, it has still contributed to Ukraine’s air defense.\n\nThe success rate of both PATRIOT and SAMP/T in ATBM engagements continues to fluctuate as Russian tactics, penetration aids, electronic warfare measures and missile flight profiles evolve.\n\nIt is particularly questionable that the WSJ would publish this claim just as a country is nearing a decision to purchase the SAMP/T system.\n\nFrom 2025, the SAMP/T NG will replace the Arabel radar with the Ground Fire 300 (France) and Kronos (Italy), enhancing its capabilities against aircraft, ballistic missiles, and drones, providing a more robust multi-layered defense.",

When Zelensky responded with facts egos were bruised and they lashed out like the dim witted, arrogant and utterly devoid of moral character idiots that they are.

        "body": "The threat of expanding war is and always has been something relevant AFTER Ukraine is conquered, not before. Russia was never going to try and invade two countries at once. But if they win in Ukraine, they have no intentions of stopping there. They’ll use the time after the war to recoup resources and then invade their next target. Russia’s playbook as a nation is actually extremely easy to predict because it’s literally all been written out (look up the foundations of geopolitics). Russia isn’t a threat because they’re going to invade every European nation at once, but because they’re an expansionist imperialist nation that will not be satisfied after each conquest. The same way that they started this was after the world tried appeasement after they annexed crimea in 2014. That’s not the threat of world war 3. The reality is that Putin doesn’t want peace, he wants to destroy Ukraine. He’s literally said as much. Again, this isn’t an isolated incident of invasion, it’s the follow up to a previous invasion where they already annexed a bunch of land. Also the reality is that if you want actual peace and not just the destruction of Ukraine, giving military aid to them is necessary. Diplomacy isn’t just some parallel alternative to war, the two are fundamentally two sides of the same coin. Diplomacy is a matter of leverage, no country has ever actually operated on purely good will in diplomacy. The best way for Ukraine to get a real peace agreement that will last is to give them the force to act as leverage. Otherwise you’ll get 2014 again where Russia ultimately comes out ahead, promises peace, takes a few years off to strengthen their forces, then breaks the agreement and invades again which is EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED the last time Russia invaded a decade ago. The idea that this is about Russia fearing Ukraine in NATO is demonstrably absurd. In part because that’s not even on the table now and was even less so before the war, and in part because nato already has based on Russian borders in other countries (not to mention that those type of range considerations are kind of obsolete in the era of ICBMs). And of course it suggests that Ukraine shouldn’t have the right to determine its own alliances on the basis of their own security interests because it might upset Russia.",

Trusting Putin's assurances is like entrusting a fox to guard a henhouse. The outcome is predictable carnage.\n\nTrump's confidence in such a deal is either willful naivety or a reflection of his own transactional ethos, where optics trump substance. Recall his own track record: abandoning the Iran nuclear deal, shredding the Paris Agreement, and undermining NATO - all while praising Putin's \"genius.\" This is not a man known for discerning fine print or valuing consistency.\n\nPutin could easily manipulate Trump into abandoning any security guarantees in the future. Just as Putin has Trump blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine, or Ukraine itself, he is easily swayed and distracted.\n\nMeanwhile, the stakes are existential for Ukraine. A \"deal\" brokered on Putin's terms would legitimize territorial conquest and embolden autocrats worldwide. Reagan's \"trust but verify\" has devolved into \"trust and capitulate\" under Trump's hypothetical diplomacy.\n\nThe question isn't whether Trump could be hoodwinked, but how catastrophically. History won't judge kindly those who mistake conmen for statesmen.",

Reacting against the large tide of immigrants arriving in the 1840s, they actively promoted \"natives,\" which they defined as American-born Protestants. Because a large number of immigrants were foreign-born Catholics from Germany and Ireland, the Know-Nothings also took an anti-Catholic stance.\n\n[Lincoln wrote](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/knownothingparty.htm) to his friend,\n\n&gt;I am not a Know-Nothing. That is certain. How could I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes, be in favor of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we begin by declaring that \"all men are created equal.\" We now practically read it \"all men are created equal, except negroes.\" When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \"all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\" When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty - to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocracy.\n\nEdit: It looks like the Library of Congress removed this content from their site.

People are calling the government to expel the Americans from the air bases in Azores. \n\nTo all that try to wash their hands saying that they didn't vote for this, you have as much guilt as any other American that sees a fucking mad clown taking over and selling your country and doing nothint about it. \n\nAlso, those giving excuses that it is our fault because we didn't invest more in our NATO obligations, just shut up. This is nothing to do with. IT IS SIMPLY ABOUT THE UNITED STATES siding with an evil agressor. \n\nFrom now on, I will boycot anything coming from the US. \nToday I started moving my IT infrastructure out of Amazon to a ln Eurpean provider, and replacing every single peace of American software with compatible options.\n\nGood bye",

The Trump administration represents all of the United States abroad, whether you voted for him or not, and his actions are the actions of the United States, so the United States has voted against condemning Russia. You can't wash your hands from that. We don't give other countries the benefit of the doubt, either. We say that Germany was responsible for the Second World War and the Holocaust and don't make a \"but actually\" exception for the many many people who didn't vote for Hitler. Precisely because there is no difference in outcome. In the same way, the United States is now responsible for having burned all its bridges with its allies, the United States is universally loathed for waging trade wars with the entire planet and the United States is being pitied for being nothing but a Russian lackey now.",

        "body": "Your timeline is off. russia started interfering when Ukraine wanted to join the EU economic bloc, at a time when there was little interest in joining NATO. \n\n&gt;Since 2012, Ukraine and the EU had been negotiating a free trade and association agreement. In 2013, the Ukrainian Parliament overwhelmingly approved finalizing the agreement with the EU, and Yanukovych urged parliament to adopt laws so that Ukraine would meet the EU's criteria and be able to sign the agreement in November 2013.\n\n&gt;Russia, however, put pressure on Ukraine to reject the EU Association Agreement. In August 2013, Russia began restricting Ukrainian imports, which Ukraine's opposition parties described as \"a trade war\" to pressure the country not to sign the agreement. The agreement was to be finalized at a summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. On 21 November, a week before the summit, Yanukovych suddenly announced he was pulling out of the agreement, and instead strengthening economic ties with Russia. Jovita Neliupšienė, foreign policy aide to Lithuania's president Dalia Grybauskaitė, said Yanukovych had called her to say he had changed his mind due to what she called Russian \"economic pressure and blackmail\". The Lithuanian president's office said Russia had threatened Ukraine with huge trade losses and job losses if it signed the EU agreement.\n\nThe start of the war in 2014 is what sparked Ukrainin interest in joining NATO\n\n&gt;In 2010, during the premiership of Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian parliament voted to abandon the goal of NATO membership and re-affirm Ukraine's neutral status, while continuing its co-operation with NATO. In the February 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, Ukraine's parliament voted to remove Yanukovych, but the new government did not seek to change its neutral status. Russia then occupied and annexed Crimea, and in August 2014 Russia's military invaded eastern Ukraine to support its separatist proxies. Because of this, in December 2014 Ukraine's parliament voted to end its neutral status, and in 2018 it voted to enshrine the goal of NATO membership in the Constitution.\n\n&gt;Polls held before 2014 found low support among Ukrainians for NATO membership. However, Ukrainian public support for NATO membership has risen greatly during the Russo-Ukrainian War, and there has been overwhelming public support for joining NATO since the 2022 Russian invasion. \n\nAnd you said\n\n&gt; Fact of the matter is Putin's always been willing to work out a deal \n\nWhat \"deal\", exactly? Did he offer to retreat to the original pre-2014 borders and return Crimea? What has his \"peace plan\" been that wouldn't completely fuck over Ukraine?",

Oh, right, they're not sincere questions, they're idiotic talking points.\n\nBut hey, I've got some tea left, I can do the list thing ...\n\n&gt; What is your definition of victory?\n\nRussia fucking back off behind the line.\n\n&gt; What’s your strategy for victory?\n\nI'm not a military strategist. \n\n&gt; When will this victory be achieved?\n\nI don't have a crystal ball.\n\n&gt; We’re already three years in. When I look at the map of the back and forth of territorial gains and losses in Ukraine, I’m reminded of the trench warfare during World War I. Thousands of young men, an entire generation dying in a war of inches. If nothing changes, how long are you willing to demand this continues? Give me your time limit. Five more years? Ten more years? Tell us when you will say this war has gone on too long.\n\nIt's already gone on too long.\n\n&gt; How much money should the U.S. pour into this war? We’re already about $200 billion in, much of it unaccounted for. Tell us what dollar amount will be too much for you.\n\nI don't care about the dollar amount particularly. When a country signs a treaty assuring the security of another, that's supposed to mean something.\n\n&gt; What are the downsides of a peace deal?\n\nDepends on the specifics of the peace deal.\n\n&gt; Have you considered the fact that a peace deal might leave Ukraine with more land than if the war continues or Ukraine loses?\n\nOf course.\n\n&gt; If all our previous aid packages didn’t make a difference, what makes you believe the next one will?\n\nDepends on the specifics of the aid. \n\n&gt; Why are you really okay with Zelensky outlawing 11 opposition parties and canceling a presidential election? A war is no excuse. Abraham Lincoln stood for reelection in the middle of a much worse situation: a civil war. Lincoln also believed he would lose. Must we destroy democracy to save democracy?\n\nThis is an incredibly stupid question. In simple, practical terms, it's almost impossible to have an election at all when the country is occupied and so many of their people are on the front line or otherwise displaced. Also, it would be unconstitutional, the Ukrainian public oppose an election now, and the Ukrainian opposition support the postponement until the war is over.\n\nAlso, love the irony of the pro-coup crowd pretending to care about democracy. \n\n&gt; If Trump is so pro-Putin, why doesn’t he pull our support from Ukraine and walk away, Enjoy your war, pal. Instead, he’s risking political capital to get a peace deal.\n\nHe is trying to walk away, he's just aiming to have an excuse for it. He's \"negotiating\" a \"peace deal\" without one of the two parties required for there to be a peace deal. His plan is to demand what Russia demanded (which he's already done) and, when Ukraine inevitably refuses, to then use that as an excuse to walk away. \n\n&gt; When did y’all — especially those on the left — begin to oppose the pursuit of peace?\n\nWhen did y'all - especially those on the far-right - become so enthusiastic about authoritarian regimes seizing territory through violent means?",

I'll agree that the current U.S. strategy is not conducive to the goal of returning Ukraine to it's pre-2014 borders.  Personally, I'd assemble a coalition similar to the first Gulf War, mostly led by European ground troops, but bolstered by some American troops and especially American air power and American logistics to destroy the invading army.\n3. When Ukraine controls its pre-2014 borders.  The U.S. has never had an end date for war.  We didn't tell the allies in WWII that we were only going to be in it for a set amount of time.  The famous WWII song \"Over There\" doesn't say \"We'll be over, we're coming over And we won't come back till the deadline.\"  It says we'll come back when it's over, over there.\n4. Yes, there is trench warfare, but only a mindless idiot would look at only the trench warfare and say that it's like WWI.  If there's a stalemate, we need to provide Ukraine the type of support that would break the stalemate... like air superiority.\n5. I wouldn't like to put a dollar figure on it, but given that this war is far more important to American security and American interests than Iraq ever was, and we spent $2 Trillion on Iraq, I'd put the figure significantly above that.\n6. It depends on the terms of the peace.  If we're considering the terms of peace Trump seems to be offering, what are the downsides of appeasing an expansionist dictator who has, on numerous occasions, voiced his goal of controlling (Either directly or through client states) practically the entire area of the former Soviet Union, dominating a population of over 200 million, including NATO countries?\n7. I have.  You know who else has?  Ukraine.  And they're still willing to fight.  The sovereignty and independence of Ukraine is worth fighting for to Ukraine.  Depriving Russia of Ukraine is absolutely in American interests.  So long as those two things are true, the war should continue.\n8. It won't, because, as I said previously, I'm readily willing to admit that our current strategy is not conducive to victory.  Biden did some good things regarding Ukraine, but ultimately, he was too weak and feckless for the moment.  Trump is more weak and feckless than Biden is.  Neither one are willing to commit to what is necessary for victory.\n9. I find it concerning, but not a dealbreaker.  You can't have a free and fair Presidential election when a significant portion of your country is behind enemy lines.  If you want to make future aid contingent on Ukraine holding an internationally monitored election, I'll go along with it.  I'm not unreasonable.  Then again, the people making this argument aren't holding Russia to that same standard.\n10. The peace deal he's offering is a peace deal on Russia's terms.  Russia wants the territory, but they also want international acceptance of Russia's seizure of territory.  They want the sanctions dropped.  They want back into the G7.  They want global acceptance of their expansionism.  They can't get global acceptance without a peace deal.  They won't be able to quickly rebuild and reconstitute their military for further expansionist wars without a peace deal and the resumption of normal trade.  Trump is trying to give them that.\n11. I don't oppose the pursuit of peace.  Putin is the one who broke the peace.  Peace is not just the absence of hostility.  Peace, sustainable peace, requires justice.  I'm not a pacifist.  I just don't support stupid wars.  I supported Afghanistan.  I supported the first Gulf War.  I did not support Iraq, Libya, or Syria.  Ukraine is not a stupid war.",

In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and began occupying more of the country, starting the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II.

I did have some gaps in math, and to this day I don't really know if I am bad at math because of the gaps or if I would have been bad at math anyway. Hard to say. \n\nWe were also rural and isolated, and as you can imagine with homeschooling in the mix that makes for a pretty big lack of socialization. My parents did try to offset that with programs that involved other homeschooled kids in the area. Siblings and I did have socialization, but it certainly wasn't hours per day most days per week like you'd get in a public school. I felt I was undersocialized when I moved away for college and thus attended like literally every single extracurricular event I could time permitting to work on my socializing hardcore. I think it helped a lot. \n\nAh, so... I don't have a negative view of homeschooling in general and I know it can be helpful for lots of different kinds of kids, especially today compared to 70s, 80s, or 90s where you saw it a lot more just for religious reasons more than anything else. I know there's different kinds of kids out there who can benefit from it. \n\nThat said, I'm quite critical of it. But it's not because I think it's bad. It's because I think that to do a good job, you have to be really heavily invested in it. And since at least one of the parents will be the primary educator, you have to really commit. I think my mum did so, and even still, like I said there were some gaps. They couldn't have afforded to bring someone in to fill in the stuff they didn't know how to explain, but ideally I think one should have some kind of access to this (but of course it is much different today with way better internet resources than when I was growing up, so perhaps it is less an issue today.)\n\nThe other part is that we had set standards and milestones that we had to meet according to law. Every couple of years a state rep would come out to administer comprehensive testing to us to make sure we were on the same track as our public school peers and not lagging. I've since learned that either these standards changed in recent years or different areas of the country have way different rules because I know people from different states who literally only have to sign a form each year. The state just trusts them that their kids are on track. Speaking frankly, I find that to be kinda wild. I don't think it is an imposition to let the state do a check to see if the kids are at the level they should be at.\n\nSo that's kind of how I feel about it. Mixed feelings, I guess you could say. I try to give benefit of the doubt since mine turned out mostly fine and I was able to fix what wasn't.",

While this event provided the immediate trigger, it was the complex interplay of rigid alliance commitments, aggressive militarism, and the expansionist ambitions of several nations that transformed a regional dispute between Austria-Hungary and Serbia into a global conflict. Austria-Hungary aimed to consolidate its influence in the Balkans, Russia was motivated by Pan-Slavism and a desire to expand its reach, and Germany’s backing of Austria-Hungary—coupled with its own strategic ambitions—further escalated tensions. Meanwhile, France and Britain were driven by their own geopolitical and imperial interests. Once mobilizations began, the intricate web of alliances left little room for a peaceful, legal resolution.",

They want their old power dynamic back where the ‘right’ people are on top of society telling the ‘lower’ ones what to do. BUT this also applies to international relations between nations! \n\nFor Trump there are certain nations that are just supposed to ‘rule’ over the others. There is supposed to be an international ‘order’ all nations follow mostly based on who’s ‘strongest thus most deserving’. And just like domestically if you ‘get out of that ‘order’ it’s your fault for what happens to you. Trump thinks that like just like he views Canada and Mexico that Ukraine is supposed to do what the big boy next door tells them to do, since this is all the ‘correct’ order as he sees it. It’s the whole I’m hitting you because YOU got out of line bullshit. Ukraine didn’t listen to Russia as they are supposed to and tried to join the west so for MAGA that’s enough to say ‘you started this by not listening to your better’. \n\nYea it’s absolutely shitty but people need to learn this is how they think.",

Yuri Shvets, a KGB major who was posted to Washington, DC in the 1980s, claimed that the Soviet Union started cultivating Trump more than 40 years ago.\n\n&gt;[*American Kompromat: How the KGB Cultivated Donald Trump*](https://books.telegraph.co.uk/Product/Craig-Unger/American-Kompromat--how-the-KGB-cultivated-Donald-Trump-a/26868145) by journalist Craig Unger claims that the KGB identified Trump as a young businessman on the rise as early as 1977, after he married his first wife, Czech model Ivana Zelníčková. Shvets, a source for the book, said that an electronics shop near Trump’s hotel, the Grand Hyatt New York, was really a KGB front. When the Trumps visited Russia for the first time in 1987, KGB operatives flattered Trump and told him he ought to go into politics.\n\n&gt;“It was a charm offensive,” Shvets told *The Guardian*. “They had collected a lot of information on \\[Trump’s\\] personality so they knew who he was personally. The feeling was that he was extremely vulnerable intellectually, and psychologically, and he was prone to flattery.\n\n&gt;“This is what they exploited. They played the game as if they were immensely impressed by his personality and believed this is the guy who should be the president of the United States one day: it is people like him who could change the world. They fed him these so-called ‘active measures’ soundbites and it happened. So it was a big achievement for the KGB active measures at the time.”\n\nFor anyone looking to preview American Kompromat, you can read a fair amount of pages here, just select preview and jump to a chapter that you're interested in.

Shvets alleges that during Trump's 1987 visit to Moscow, KGB operatives flattered him and encouraged his political ambitions, leading to his public criticism of U.S. foreign policy upon returning home. These assertions are detailed in journalist Craig Unger's book \"American Kompromat.\" While these claims provide a provocative perspective on Trump's interactions with Russia, they are based on the accounts of former intelligence officials and have not been universally corroborated.

Canada's prime minister testified that he is a Russian asset funded by Russia). Tim Pool aka Dim Tool (paid by Russia). Dave Rubin (paid by Russia).

Russia is rapidly running out of money. The exchange rate is being artificially boosted by forcing banks to give the government loans. It can't go on.\n\nhttps://x.com/JayinKyiv/status/1878487780994781692\n\nIf Trump fully gave Ukraine the military aid they need he could end this war in Ukraine's favour in no time and the rest of the world would bow down in front of him in gratitude, including most Russians, who are sick and tired of it. That would be a surefire route to the Nobel Peace prize. Hand Ukraine to Russia and he will be remembered by history as  a weak man and a Quisling. \n\nGifting Ukraine to Putin is also a green light to Russia, China, and North Korea to do \"What the hell they want\" to quote Trump. Those that think this is not going to have ramifications for the US need to think again. Isolationism didn't do wonders for America's security in 1941. Today is no different. And US influence in world affairs will begin a downhill slide it will never recover from.\n\nPutin is the head of the Hydra. If Russia loses it's the end of Putin. He must be defeated or the free world, yes, including the US, will pay a heavy price down the line. Continuing to support Ukraine is the easiest, and cheapest, way America can ensure its interests and security remain strong.\n\nTrump's route to the prize is in ending the scourge of Russia's constant meddling in our democracies and not in the sacrifice of a sovereign nation and its people to the genocidal intentions of its despot neighbour.",

Shame on our leaders for being too scared of losing re-election to try something as basic as decent healthcare. \n\nAnd remember, it’s not just charity or principle.

In Yemen, he escalated both U.S. counterterrorism activities and support for the devastating Saudi-led war against the Houthis.

They reason, if they give us Ukraine the likelihood of fulfilling Article 5 obligations is small. I say they, but I mean Putin. He will gamble on it because he's a narcissist like Trump and a megalomaniac who sees his destiny in bringing Russkiy Mir to the whole world. He thinks he's another Peter the Great. And he's in charge, not the government.\n\nI'll repeat here what I said to the OP earlier.\n\nYou know that Putin's goal is the annexation of the whole of Ukraine and the murder of anyone who doesn't fall in line? He's failed so far thanks to Western support.\n\nMany Kremlin propagandists are active on social media doing their utmost to undermine support for Ukraine, because Putin knows that as long as Western support continues his genocidal war is doomed. With an economy the size of Italy there's only so long he can maintain it. Time is fast running out. Russia is rapidly running out of money. The exchange rate is being artificially inflated by forcing banks to give the government loans.\n\nhttps://x.com/JayinKyiv/status/1878487780994781692\n\nIt can't go on. If Trump fully gave Ukraine the military aid they need he could end this war in Ukraine's favour in no time and garner the thanks of the rest of the world, including most Russians, who are sick and tired of it. He might even get nominated for the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts. Hand Ukraine to Russia and he will be reviled as the leader who opened the door to the destruction of a sovereign country and the genocide of millions of its innocent citizens.\n\nIf Ukraine loses it's also a green light to Russia, China, and North Korea to do \"What the hell they want\" to quote Trump. If you think that's not going to have ramifications for the US think again. American influence in world affairs will begin a downhill slide they will never recover from.\n\nPutin is the head of the Hydra. If Russia loses it's the end of Putin. He must be defeated or the free world, yes, including the US, will pay a heavy price down the line. Continuing to support Ukraine is the cheapest way America can ensure its interests and security remain strong.\n\nIn monetary terms the aid amounts to a tiny fraction of US military spend. And most of it stays in the US anyway as is used updating stocks with more modern equipment. Most of the aid is equipment that was mothballed and would be more expensive to decommission than give away.",

        "body": "Trump deserves no preemptive credit for anything. All he's shown us is that he's eager to cave into Putin's demands. Even suggesting the U.S. withdraw from NATO.\n\nThis is as good a time as any to remind people of just how great an asset Trump has been for Putin.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, he frequently repeated Kremlin propaganda about things like the annexation of Crimea, about NATO in particular, and about the threat of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.\n\nTrump has repeated Putin's false claims about Ukraine that served as a pretext for his invasion.\n\nTrump said that Putin did *\"an amazing job of taking the mantle\"* when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. And in 2016, during his presidential campaign, Trump encouraged the annexation of the territory and repeated a Kremlin talking point, saying, *\"The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.\"*\n\nTrump also refused to condemn Russia for its attacks on Ukrainian military vessels in 2018.\n\nAhead of the 2016 RNC, the Trump campaign blocked Republican party language that called for the U.S. to send weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russian proxies.\n\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, while at a news conference in July 2016, he pleaded with Russia to continue its attacks, saying,  \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\"\n\nTrump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and used hacked emails to attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts\"\n\nTrump continued denying that Russia interfered in the election.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, The Trump transition team begged the Russians not to escalate in response to sanctions that were imposed under Obama. Michael Flynn personally asked the Russian ambassador not to escalate the situation because the incoming Trump admin intended to have a good relationship with Putin.\n\nTrump told the Wall Street Journal that he was considering lifting Russian sanctions, he said, *\"If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?\"*\n\nIn 2017, lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that included new Russian sanctions. Trump was reluctant to signing the bill and it was reported that the Trump admin demanded that the language in the bill be \"watered down.\" Those involved said that Trump would have likely shot the sanctions down if they didn't pass with a veto proof majority in both houses.\n\nIn response to Putin being labeled a \"killer\" for murdering his political opponents, Trump said in 2015, *\"I haven't seen any evidence that he killed anybody, in terms of reporters.\"* Then again, in response to the same accusations against Putin in 2017, he said, *\"There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?\"*\n\nTrump later openly congratulated Putin on his 2018 election win, despite evidence showing it was illegitimate. \n\nTrump even considered returning multiple spy bases to Russia located in Maryland and New York after the Obama administration seized the compounds and expelled all Russian \"diplomats.\"\n\nTrump shared highly classified intelligence with two senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting in 2017.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin on one of his most important goals—the weakening of NATO. Trump has called NATO \"obsolete,\" and has reportedly, on several occasions, said that he wants to withdraw from NATO.\n\nTrump even proposed working directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and lawmakers had to remind him that Russia was responsible for repeatedly engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration lifted sanctions on Russian Oligarch, and Putin ally, Oleg Deripaska.\n\nTrump also tried to rescind Russian sanctions after defector, Sergei Skripal was poisoned in an assassination attempt by Russia.\n\nTrump abandoned our Kurdish allies and withdrew from Syria, which helped aid Russian proxy wars and gave Putin the opportunity to take over abandoned U.S. military outposts.\n\nLet's not forget that Trump froze aid to Ukraine and delayed sales of important Javelin, anti-tank missiles when Ukraine was desperate for this aid in its fight against Russian proxies. Javelin missiles in particular have proved to be a major front-line defense for Ukraine against Russian military advances.\n\nTrump has called Putin's invasion of Ukraine \"genius,\" and \"savvy,\" and has continuously threatened to not honor our commitment to any NATO countries who are \"delinquent.\" Encouraging Russia to do whatever it wants to allies who don't contribute enough to military spending.\n\nTrump described NATO as if it was going bankrupt, saying, *\"I went to NATO. And NATO was essentially going out of business 'cause people weren't paying and it was going down, down, down,\"*\n\nTrump doesn't even know how NATO works...\n\nin 2014, NATO members agreed to move \"toward\" spending 2 percent of GDP on national defense by 2024.\n\n&gt; The 2 percent is a benchmark that each member should spend on its own defense in order to be able to contribute to the joint defense of the alliance. However, the goal is voluntary, and there is no debt or \"delinquency\" involved.\n\nDespite what Trump thinks, each country's spending doesn't go towards some NATO \"fund\", but towards their own defense.\n\nTrump has called the U.S., *\"the schmucks that are paying for the whole thing.\"* Not comprehending that the funding benchmark has to do with each country's own defense spending. We're not \"paying for NATO.\" In fact, our military spending has actually decreased over recent years.\n\nNATO was established after WWII to help combat Soviet expansion. Republicans, much like Trump, have argued NATO is irrelevant now that the Soviet Union is gone. This is absurd.\n\nTrump campaigned on the idea of capitulating to Putin. Arguing that if we just give Putin what he wants, the war will end, just like that. However, much like Churchill didn't negotiate with Hitler because he was a dangerous expansionist looking to consolidate power through any means, while his overtures of peace were merely strategic moves, U.S leaders should take the same stance against Putin.\n\nThat's because Putin is also looking to consolidate power. His goal is to annex as much of Ukraine as possible, rob its people of their independence, then continue with his \"special military occupation,\" err, I mean *operation* into other regions of Eastern Europe, where he will expand his oil empire and create soviet-like \"spheres of influence\" in territories that his military seizes.\n\nTrump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that if Trump were president, this war wouldn't have happened. Not only is this delusional, but it's very likely, judging by everything I've pointed out, that Trump helped accelerate this war in the first place, and as president, he will continue to help advance Putin's autocratic, escalating, warmongering, land grabbing agenda, as well as his efforts to expand his control over oil.",

A financial obligation is a term for a contract which mandates the payment of that amount under some terms and conditions.\n\nKey word here is under some terms and conditions. For example when you're obligated to pay off a loan, you don't just pay off the full amount at once. You pay off say $300 a month. \n\nAll this suggests is that the money is there allocated for Ukraine but it just hasn't been sent yet. I think Zelenskys response might have been to trump, who said that money has been given.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that someone might be making it really difficult legislatively to send the money in time.

He's not taking in money from under-the-table criminal enterprises. But it certainly seems his habit of helping others launder money is old and well-engrained. He's done it with properties as well, helping criminals move money around buying and selling his properties at crazy-inflated prices. \n\nThere are few, if any, organizations Trump has touched that come out uncorrupted. How much money is he going to make this term bilking the taxpayers for room-and-board for the Secret Service every time he stays at one of his tacky resorts? Says he wants Greenland, but I'm unconvinced he won't impulsively try to sell Alaska back to Russia or California to Mexico. He doesn't care about sovereignty, he's an increasingly senile career criminal whose brain works exclusively via zero-sum transaction.

The MeidasTouchNetwork on YouTube (a network of channels started by three Meiselas brothers, including one lawyer, lots of interesting guests and hosts and cohosts with legal and other relevant knowledge) has been giving clips of that. \n\nDenmark and Canada are NATO members, so that should be interesting if he tries to get what he wants with the military. The responses have been both firm and hilarious at the same time. Denmark changed the Royal coat of arms to feature the symbol for Greenland more prominently. Canada has been suggesting that they should acquire Alaska and some other states as new provinces. Mexico tried to explain to Donald about tariffs and what they actually do and how retaliatory tariffs work. Panama seems to be considering banning the US from using the Panama Canal... Nobody seems interested in renaming the Gulf of Mexico \"the Gulf of America\". \n\nDanish media found out that Don Jr's photo op with Greenlanders wearing MAGA hats was done by promising a free meal to some homeless people.  Don't know how many spoke or read English or if an interpreter was provided. Or if they cared. It was like having to listen to the Salvation Army spiel before getting free food. \n\nAlso fun is watching Biden Trump-proofing so many things before Jan 20. Don't know if the regular media has been covering it, but his efforts get mentioned sometimes on the MeidasTouchNetwork. It's like toddler-proofing your house before a visit from rowdy grandchildren.",

There were frequent reports in his first administration that he simply doesn't read and that all his briefings had to be verbal and reduced to 3 bullet points else Trump's eyes would glaze over and nothing said would penetrate his stupid numb brain. \n\nThen there was the famous comment \"I'm president and you're not\" that he used several times in various interviews in 2018, one to \"60 Minutes\". This is what a 14 year old would say to win an argument and is frankly embarrassing to hear from a President's mouth. \n\nhttps://x.com/60Minutes/status/1051625403671035906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1051625403671035906%7Ctwgr%5E5d28252c80d94e32152a7af12410c4f4a01f5666%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fdonald-trump-60-minutes-lesley-stahl-1168982\n\nThe danger with Trump is that he has siloed himself from accurate data outside his habitual GOP newsfeed. He will simply ignore anything critical or contradictory to his morning bowel movement brainstorms. Having achieved his second term he will now trust his malign instincts more than in his first term - so nothing but chaos for the next 4 years.\n\nWhich, sadly, is just fine for the media. Trump controversy has been a gold mine for them and as much as Dems might not like to hear it, Dem websites of choice chum the waters with bullsh*t controversy as much as GOP sites.

And they cite this information to state that Trump was being more egotistical. \n\nNow, if that’s how things are, then we wouldn’t see all these flagrant attacks by Russia and China. In addition, Putin has finally demonstrated that hypersonic missile. The thing about those missiles is that they are probably using thousands of computer chips, and Putin is currently sanctioned by the CHIPS Act, so he has to build so many more facilities to produce the chips. The CHIPS Act is hard to repeal, although not impossible. That would mean every House Republican would need to get on board and that’s not exactly an easy thing to do, unless Trump plans to press any Republicans who oppose. But of course, Putin launched this after the nude photos, so he knows it’s in the bag. \n\nAnd the biggest issue by far is that Trump plans to gut the DOJ, so that means people exporting semiconductor fabrication equipment will be so much less likely to get investigated and prosecuted. If anything, Putin already has insiders ready to export as soon as Trump gets into power. Missiles will absolutely demolish and destroy Ukraine. Not only do they help taking over strategic positions, they also make rebuilding more expensive. ",

That war is horrible, horrible.\"\n\nTrump, who is set to return to the White House in January, previously said on the campaign trail that if elected, he could end the war \"in 24 hours.\" The president-elect recently criticized the policy change by President Joe Biden that allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russian territory.\n\nThe president-elect also recently said Ukraine will \"possibly\" receive less military aid once he takes office. Ukraine is heavily reliant on its international partners for military, financial and humanitarian aid that enables it to continue functioning as a state, and fighting Russia after almost three years of war. \n\n\"The number of soldiers being killed...\" Trump said Sunday. \"It's a flat plane, and the bullets are going and there's powerful bullets, powerful guns, and the only thing that's going to stop them is a human body.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris along with French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral. After the meeting, Trump called for an \"immediate ceasefire\".",

It has enormous agricultural, mineral (in particular rare earth metals) and fossil fuel resources.

They did not want another NATO country on their border with missiles and other weapons systems stationed on their doorstep. A democratic Ukraine is a threat to the Russian oligarchy. And it has many ethnic Russians and Russian speakers and was part of the USSR until 1991. Ukraine is geostrategically a very important piece of territory - that's one of the reasons the US and Europe have tried so hard to pull them out of the Russian orbit ever since the USSR collapsed and particularly since 2008 when their future NATO membership was discussed.\n\nWhat Russia has done is absolutely horrid from a humanitarian perspective and has backfired on them massively, but I understand that there were many reasons they decided to do it.",

Putin is ruthless and amoral but he isn't stupid. He's not going to start WW3 over Poland. \n\nA major reason Putin attacked Ukraine when he did was that they had not yet joined NATO. He wouldn't have dared had they belonged to the alliance. Why do you think he's complained so much for so long about NATO expansion? It's because attacking countries that join is then off the table as a realistic course of action.\n\nRussia will certainly continue its covert support for rightwing, pro-Russian regimes throughout the world, however. That's actually far more of a threat than them invading more countries. Just look how successful it has been for them backing Trump.",

General Keith Kellogg has been nominated to be Trump's special envoy to the countries. He previously served as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence and acted as chief of staff of the National Security Council, as reported by the Associated Press.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"I am very pleased to nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Keith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration. He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday.\n&gt; \n&gt; The highly decorated retired general has previously advised Trump on strategies in the region. Kellogg presented a plan involving peace talks and a ceasefire back in June, as reported by Reuters. However the plan notably left current battle lines in place, leaving Russia in control of much of Ukraine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The president-elect has criticized the large amounts of aid given to Ukraine in the past, leading Ukrainian leaders and supporters to worry that Trump would cease or reduce supplies for their war effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared less worried following a call with Trump and Elon Musk earlier this month, where they reportedly pledged their support to Ukraine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kellogg marks the fourth former Fox News contributor to be added to the administration, after presenter Pete Hegseth was nominated for secretary of defense and contributor and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was nominated to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trump also nominated Fox News host and former Wisconsin Rep.

It’s hard to state. We have effectively helped raise Ukraine up to a world-class professional military in terms of their performance by giving them access to our intelligence tech and the wealth of knowledge our military has accrued from keeping tabs on Russia for 80 years. Ukraine has learned a lot and will be able to fight on very well on their own now, but it would still be another devastating blow for them to lose access to that behind the scenes assistance.

I want her to think for herself so I just say what both sides are saying and let her decide, but again, she's going by my life experience. \n\nMany people are reliant on someone else to decide who to vote for and that is inherently flawed, yet, at the same time, people don't have the capacity to inform themselves. \n\nDoes our current political infrastructure work?

Can one person change the entire system? \n\nI worked in government agencies and the degree of corruption that I saw was deeply rooted all the way down to the lowest level employees. \n\nOur current make up is flawed to the core as it puts financial success and the most amount of leisure as the peak of achieving success as it demands a cost in terms of suffering, environment, cheap labour, etc..",

Trump's promises of isolationism and peace mean that he has to pursue those ends *no matter how unreasonable Putin might be*, and from Putin's perspective, he wants Trump to know that. \n\nRecall that Putin is the same guy who spent 2008-2020 ordering hits throughout Europe, poisoning other heads of state poisoned, throwing people out of windows in Russia, all while making virtually NO attempt to cover it up. People knowing that he's in control is part of what gives him power in and out of Russia. \n\nHe wants Trump to know that he thinks Trump is a bitch. He wants Trump to spend the next 2 months sweating how he's going to get out of this situation with any semblance of dignity or authority. That way, when Putin says he wants a NATO resolution that Ukraine is never allowed in and that he wants all the territory east of Kyiv, Trump will have to say \"yes sir\".",

        "body": "Hello MfDoorway. Gabriel here at the Sunday Times. Let me begin by saying something journalists probably ought to say more regularly. I don't know. However, my instincts are as follows. \n\n\\- Trump is self-evidently pro-Israel. You will recall he was the president who caved to longstanding campaign to move the US embassy to Jersualem. And he was an architect of the Abraham Accords which sought to marginalise the Palestinian question in favour of a wider geostrategic realignment against Iran and which was supposed to be Bibi Netanyahu's signature foreign policy achievement when it was unveiled in the Rose Garden. \n\n  \nHOWEVER, Trump is guided by nothing if not self-interest and has no deeper or more abiding instinct than his opposition to costly foreign entanglements. He may be more anti-that than he is pro-Israel in relation to the ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon. He also has a complex relationship with Netanyahu who was one of the early world leaders to welcome Biden's victory back in 2020. There is a third, newer dimension to the question too, which is that Trump won, and, in his victory speech, celebrated winning, a lot of Arab and Muslim votes this week.\n\nFor that reason I can envisage a situation where he tells Netanyahu it's time to wrap up the conflict - he won't quibble with the underlying goals or the notion of Israel's right to self defence but may well tell him to hasten its resolution. \n\nI'll leave the other bits to my esteemed colleagues.",

His past foreign policy has done nothing to indicate that he wants to start a foreign war. He did not create any death camps.

He's not following through on all his promises true because half of them are rhetorical or just a bit of bluster.

Hard-right conservatives  are in favour of displaying American military strength, particularly as regards China, and the strongly pro-Israel elements in the Republican party are advocating full-blown support for Binyamin Netanyahu and the War on Gaza. But then there's the \"American First\" lobby, not to say the outright conspiracy theory wing led by Tucker Carlson, who want Trump to \"end the endless wars\" and focus on domestic politics. The latter seem to have won out with Ukraine, if he really does do the deal he has promised with Putin. But in the Middle East and Far East, the contradiction could easily lead to dangerous miscalculation. If China thinks that Trump isn't committed to defending Taiwan, that would put America's traditional policy in the Pacific in a dangerous quandary. Trump was asked about this and he said \"I'm crazy, so Xi Jinping wouldn't dare.\" Is that really a sustainable policy for an American president?  \nThere's an analysis I wrote about this posted at the top of the thread.  \nRichard Spencer",

On the basis he wants to end all wars, he may force Ukraine/Russia into a peace deal in the short term but I think that's likely to lead to greater escalation in the longer term as Russia uses the opportunity to re-build its military. He is likely to take a tougher approach to Iran - so the wider Middle East conflict may become more dangerous  - yet he is likely to want to see a ceasefire when it comes to Gaza and Hezbollah. I think there's going to be a lot of US focus on the Indo-Pacific region over the coming years and Trump has effectively promised a trade war with China which would affect large parts of the world so I think that is a major worry for many in the West.

Trump's said he would impose 60 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from China, and that would be a big blow. China's economy is struggling a bit at the moment (though its 4-5 per cent growth this year is only bad compared to previous years). However,  China has seen it coming - Biden also raised tariffs, and the threat from Trump was always clear.

Look closely and they are Chinese.  \nWhether Trump actually goes ahead I don't really know. It's quite interesting looking at how close Elon Musk has become to Trump. We tend to look at this just through the prism of Twitter/X and the two men's shared love of the limelight - birds of a feather, if you like. But Musk has clear commercial interests here. Tesla has a massive factory in China, and sold $22 billion of cars in China last year. That's big. He regularly meets Chinese leaders - including President Xi and the prime minister, Li Qiang, and has adopted a lot of Chinese talking points, even on topics like Taiwan. Will he end up using his influence with Trump to moderate anti-China rhetoric?\n\nRichard Spencer",

But I think the \"deals\" he will try to strike could be very destabilising and realign regional balances of power in ways that are very unpredictable. A good example - though very technical - is when he tried to do a deal with President Erdogan of Turkey during his last presidency about America's support for the Kurds in north-east Syria. Suddenly a complex situation which had a simple purpose - building an alliance of forces against Islamic State - suddenly got a whole lot worse. There was a brief war inside Syria between Turkey and the Kurds, US troops were stuck in the middle, Russia came in as a mediator and suddenly you had Russian and American troops squaring up in a remote part of the Syrian desert. It sounds like something you wouldn't make up in the craziest war movie, but it happened.   \nEventually things calmed down, but imagine something similar happening on one of the current conflict lines in the Middle East, or in the Far East...  \nAs for Israel - this is a really big question. What is Trump's bottom line for US support for Israel? Will he support an expansion of the war to Iran? Again, my feeling is that there is a bottom line, but the idea that there isn't could make the war worse. Of course, as some have suggested, if he really did tell Netanyahu to stop the war Netanyahu would listen to him more than he does to Biden - but whether there would be any incentive to find a longer term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is another matter.  \nRichard Spencer",

This which was itself a result of Britain's growing secularisation - a trend with has only accelerated since.\n\nTrump's situation in some ways resembles the opposite of  the above.

From where I look,  social media is certainly taking over a lot of the discourse - whether Instagram pix or serious debate on Twitter or forums like Reddit - but most people are aware that these are places for discussion, however wild, banter and stirring things up, not for calm consieration of facts. Legacy media have come back into the game for those prepared to pay for what used to be called derisively \"gatekeeping\". On your side of the Atlantic (assuming you're American) for all its critics the New York Times has ten million paying subscribers. That's ten times the number it had when it was just a print product. Fox news remains a big influence on voters, clearly.  \nWhat I do see as  happening from my side of the Atlantic is that audiences are becoming more polarised in America as they already were in Britain. Papers in the US used to be city-wide - New York Times, Baltimore Sun or whatever. That model's not sustainable in an internet world. Now the papers are trying to define themselves for bigger markets - but are being attacked by the left for not being left enough and the right for not being right enough, but everyone agrees they are biased (but for opposite reasons). It's a tough situation.  \nIn Britain, papers have always been politically aligned so it's easier for us. The BBC, though, is in exactly the same position as the NYT - assailed from both sides.\n\nRichard Spencer",

Let me try answer in a way which doesn't just amount to a defensive riposte to your comment about \"lies\". The answer is, erm, yes. I am worried about the obsolescence of what you describe as legacy media. Nobody could possibly have watched newspapers haemorrhage circulation and withdraw from communities over the last two decades and conclude anything other than the fact we face an existential challenge, and have in the case of many titles already lost it - i.e. look at the number of local and regional tiles on both sides of the pond which no longer exist.  \n\nI am an official Millennial - I hate that term - and can inform you I don't know a single member of my age group who buys a print paper, which is possibly fine and no longer surprising. Just as stark however is how few people consume any traditional media full-stop.  \n\nThankfully for you, and for democracy, the only way we can restore our role, and both retain and win back readers, is by earning their trust and reporting in an accurate, fair and compelling way. I promise we try harder at those things than you probably think, but don't take my word for it.

        "body": "That's  a perfectly reasonable question. Trump keeps saying he wants \"deals\" and what's wrong with that?  \nThere are two problems. One is the precedent which always hangs over at least British discussion of war (and not just British I'm sure) - Chamberlain struck a peace deal with Hitler over Czechoslovakia in 1938 and look where that got the world. The fear of appeasement hangs heavy in the debate over what to do about Russia - attempts to meet Putin halfway in the past don't seem to quench his thirst for rebuilding the Russian Empire.  \nThe second problem is because Trump comes over as erratic it raises the possibility of miscalculation. If his interlocutors think he is going to give them a big concession in return for a deal, they can then become more, not less, assertive in pursuing their goals. That is, arguably, what happened in Afghanistan, where Trump's \"peace deal\" with the Taliban left them far more sure than before that they could just take the whole country by force, which they did once Trump was out of office. America was then forced to escalate, and then decided to pull out. It was all a bit of a mess.  \nOf course, it's possible that he really might strike a decent deal. But again, would he be looking at the small print? That's where the devil often is, and is he a small print person?  \nRichard Spencer",

There are concerns that pushing for a peace deal could be seen as a weakness by Putin and he may use any opportunity to re-build his military and come back to retake more territory.

I'd love to know what they think.  \nt's a difficult one - it could be the defining issue of the next few years if people on all sides get their calculations wrong.  \nTaiwan is clearly nervous that Trump might either pull back from support for Taiwan (in keeping with \"America First\" and its dislike of \"foreign wars\"); or that he might strike some sort of deal with President Xi which leaves the island exposed. There's also the possibility that he might turn against Taiwan's semiconductor industry, which is so vital both economically but also as  \"roadblock\" to conflict given how important it is to China too. It's just the sort of industry Trump and Vance would want to \"reshore\" to America. That would leave Taiwan very vulnerable.  \nMy feeling though is that at the end of the day Trump knows that the build up of forces on either side in the Pacific is dangerous and has to be managed carefully, and he will realise it would take too much of his attention, on a topic that isn't his first concern, if he decided to do anything to really stir things up. If I were in his shoes, I'd say I had a lot to be getting on with making America great again, and the conventional deterrence policy in the Pacific has worked so far, and leave it at that. One of the \"MAGA-friendly\" policy wonks in Trump's orbit - Eldridge Colby, and there's rumours he might get a job in the administration though I've no idea whether they are true or not - has said some very hardline things about China. But when you look closely, they are far more in line with conventional thinking than they look at first.\n\nThat may be over-optimistic. We are in unknown territory, after all, this time round - many of the conventional hardline Republicans like Mike Pompeo became disillusioned with him first time round and probably won't work for him again, so we will probably have a fairly untested team around him.\n\nRichard Spencer",

Its creation essentially means that from now on it will be NATO itself, rather than its biggest contributor the United States, that will coordinate training Ukrainian troops and providing military equipment. \n\n&gt; The Group of 7 – which unites the United States, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Canada and Japan – finalised a $50 billion long-term loan to Ukraine that would be funded largely by the interest on frozen Russian assets in Europe.  \n\n&gt; Outgoing US President Joe Biden has backed up his European allies by pre-empting the potential risk of a US withdrawal from the deal should Trump be re-elected by making sure the $20 billion US contribution will start becoming available by the end of the year. Congress has approved five bills on Ukraine assistance since the start of the war worth $175 billion, with $106 billion going directly to the government of Ukraine. At a news conference in Riga in mid-October, James O’Brien, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said that Biden will be “emptying out” the funds the US Congress has earmarked for Ukraine before the end of his term. \n\n\n&gt; Although it is not possible for a US president to unilaterally pull the country out of NATO – Congress last year passed a law that such a decision needs Senate approval – Trump’s threat still remains very real as he calls the Alliance's golden rule on mutual defence into question.\n\nTL;DR NATO and the Biden Administration have been formulating a contingency plan that empties out current US funding for Ukraine, while transitioning responsibilities to European powers, who are funding it with frozen Russian assets.",

If we really, really wanted to end the Israel-Arab conflict for good and didn't care about the reverberations, we could do it. What's more, we could do it one of two ways. \n\nWe could join the fray militarily and very easily push non-Israelis out of whatever area we desired. Of course, that's genocide, but it is easily within our power.\n\nWe could cut off all aid to Israel. Israel would stumble on for a while, but ultimately would lose just due to numbers and the increasing lack of resources.\n\nThe same thing holds true for Ukraine. We could join the Ukrainians (with or without NATO) and push Russia off all Ukrainian territory very quickly -within weeks, possibly days. Or we could cut off aid to Ukraine and they would fall to Russia. It would take more time, but Ukraine would fall. (Which would be a disaster for the West, let alone the Ukrainians.)\n\nNot only could we do either of those, we could do them both. And we could invade Russia simultaneously.\n\nNo other nation on Earth has that capacity.",

The invasion of Ukraine had nothing to do with NATO and [everything to do with conquest.](https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/hailing-peter-the-great-putin-draws-parallel-with-mission-to-return-russian-lands)\n\n&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin paid tribute on Thursday to Tsar Peter the Great on the 350th anniversary of his birth, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their twin historic quests to win back Russian lands.\n\n&gt;“Peter the Great waged the Great Northern War for 21 years. It would seem that he was at war with Sweden, he took something from them. He did not take anything from them, he returned (what was Russia’s),” Putin said after a visiting an exhibition dedicated to the tsar.\n\n&gt;In televised comments on day 106 of his war in Ukraine, he compared Peter’s campaign with the task facing Russia today.\n\n&gt;“Apparently, it also fell to us to return (what is Russia’s) and strengthen (the country). And if we proceed from the fact that these basic values form the basis of our existence, we will certainly succeed in solving the tasks that we face.”\n\n&gt;Putin, now in his 23rd year in power, has repeatedly sought to justify Russia’s actions in Ukraine, where his forces have devastated cities, killed thousands and put millions of people to flight, by propounding a view of history that asserts Ukraine has no real national identity or tradition of statehood.\n\nWhat about 7000 word essay written by [Putin himself back in 2021](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putin-admits-ukraine-invasion-is-an-imperial-war-to-return-russian-land/)?\n\n&gt;His unapologetically imperialistic attitude toward Russian-Ukrainian relations was laid bare in July 2021 in the form of a 7,000-word essay authored by Putin himself which set out to explain the alleged “historical unity” binding the two nations together. “I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia. For we are one people,” Putin the amateur historian concluded. This bizarre treatise was widely interpreted as a declaration of war against the entire notion of an independent Ukraine and has since been made required reading for all Russian military personnel.",

Allowing Russia to claim and be rewarded with portions of a sovereign nation will embolden Russia to continue seeking what it believes is owed to it. Russia cannot sustain its current level of support to the conflict in Ukraine over the longer-term (3-5 years) and is pushing hard now to secure as much territory as possible for a more advantageous position in negotiations before the next election; this is not an argument to sustain the bloody conflict in perpetuity, but simply to point out that Russia is pressing it’s advantage currently.\n\nEdited for format",

And training their military.\n\nBut when you say without NATO. Do you mean like NATO actually fighting or also NATO/US/EU giving them weapons?
