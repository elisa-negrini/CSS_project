Like, you guys used to have russian language and literature classes at school just a few decades ago, didn’t you? And russia has a habit of using those kind of “russian culture lovers clubs/classes” as its soft power, pushing imperialistic narratives in-between the lines.

I’ve also heard those narratives aren’t tolerated in Bulgaria these days and that’s really a big step. But that doesn’t cancel out the two older generations that have already soaked in the narrative and might push it upon younger people who avoided the Soviet period.

Honestly, I believe most people around 40 or older aren’t prone to changing their mind, so there might be nothing to be done. Just keep on educating yourself and researching the topics, reach out in this community if you have any doubts.

To answer your question: no, there have been no violent oppressions. In-between 2014 and 2022 (8 years in the war on the eastern front) Ukraine has finally removed russian language’s status of one of the official ones in the country and it finally stopped being taught in schools. Those kinda laws appeared. But that barely affected the lives of russian-speaking citizens and ethnic russians. That I can tell and actually show you first hand :)

And our ""socialist"" party, the remnants of the old ""communist"" party are all a bunch of cowards who didn't even have the balls to condemn Russia after news about the Bucha massacre spread. 

As for the people themselves, from what I've seen of the pro-Russian/anti-EU protests there's like, 3 groups of people who show up: dumbfuck rightwing nationalist ""patriots"", old people and paid protestors. Overall they're a minority but they're loud. Most Bulgarians have a general distaste for Russia, not least because we all know how far Russia has shoved its dick in our politics and has done so for decades. 

Yeah, I read about the removal of Russian from the school curriculum and as a recognised regional language. That seems to be what the Russians are basing their claims of repression on.

Ukraine has been an independent sovereign nation for more than 32 years but the Soviet-era versions of many geographic names stubbornly persist in international practice. The transliterations of the names of cities, regions and rivers from the Cyrillic alphabet into Latin are often mistakenly based on the Russian form of the name, not the Ukrainian; the most misspelled names are:

|||
|-|-|
|**Archaic Soviet-era spelling**|**Correct modern spelling**|
|the Ukraine|Ukraine|
|Kiev|Kyiv|
|Lvov|Lviv|
|Odessa|Odesa|
|Kharkov|Kharkiv|
|Nikolaev|Mykolaiv|
|Rovno|Rivne|
|Ternopol|Ternopil|
|Chernobyl|Chornobyl|

Under the Russian empire and later the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Russification was actively used as a tool to extinguish each constituent country’s national identity, culture and language. In light of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, including its illegal occupation of Crimea, we are once again experiencing Russification as a tactic that attempts to destabilize and delegitimize our country. You will appreciate, we hope, how the use of Soviet-era placenames – rooted in the Russian language – is especially painful and unacceptable to the people of Ukraine.

Reality and refutation

* **No evidence of genocide:** Investigations by the International Court of Justice and other bodies found no credible evidence to support Russia's genocide claims.
* **Russian involvement in Donbas:** Contrary to Russian narratives, evidence suggests direct Russian military and financial support for separatists in Donbas since 2014.
* **Ukrainian identity:** The invasion, ironically, strengthened Ukrainian national identity and solidified support for a path away from Russia. 

In essence, Russia's justification for its actions in Donbas and the subsequent invasion relied on a campaign of false promises and propaganda, including unfounded allegations and fabricated pretexts designed to sow confusion and gain support for its military agenda.

They played a critical role in the abduction of thousands of children from Ukraine.   Fortunately a number of them subsequently defected and testified in the International Criminal Court (ICC).  Their testimony in the Hague helped in the prosecution of Putin for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  If Putin really is the good guy how come he's a war criminal?

The ""Little Green Men"" were ready because for years they were actively involved in false flag attacks on civilians in the Donbas.   Take for example the testimony of Igor Salikov, an officer of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).

[https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/)

&gt;Having been involved in Russia’s war against Ukraine since 2014, Salikov witnessed Russia’s covert takeover and hybrid warfare in eastern Ukraine. In a bombshell interview with with founder Vladimir Osechkin, he tells how chief puppetmaster Vladislav Surkov carefully constructed the fiction of a “Donbas uprising,” how he and other Russian proxies were allowed to use only legacy Soviet equipment to avoid giving Russia away, and how Russia conducted shelled its own territory to frame Ukraine, constructing the Big Lie of a “Donbas genocide.” 

Before the war, the number of civilian deaths in the Donbas was declining and nothing like what it now is due to Putin's blatant shameless war of aggression.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/)

&gt;Prior to the war, fighting took place in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and separatist forces supported by the Russian government. Over the course of 2021, 25 conflict-related deaths were recorded in Ukraine. Between April 14 and December 31, 2014, the number of killed civilians exceeded 2,084. These include 298 victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) which was shot down in July 2014.

I'm guessing your dad doesn't care about the 298 civilians killed when a commercial plane was shot down by the DPR in July 2014.   They don't count because they're not 'ethnic Russians'.

I think there is some sense in that. I have a brother in law that keeps bringing up pro russian thoughts or anti-semetic stuff.  


Instead of arguing we just let him know that we are not interested in discussing these topics. Especially since this only happens in a whatsapp group chat and the bigger portion off things he sends are either links through instagram reels or just a long message with the notion of some documentary that we should definitely watch. 


I think his main motivation to come up with all this is his tendency to not be mainstream and have some sense that he understands it all and everyone else is in the dark. Must feel good. 


My idea of dealing with this is to ask open questions and dive deeper in where the need to keep reading into this and watch documentaries and follow IG accounts, comes from. Just to be interested in him as a family member and not to discuss. This creates space and removed the idea that he is the special one to understand and no one else is interested. I am interested but in the end I draw different conclusions and have a different opinion. 


If someone is not interested to hear my ideas, the it does not make sense to discuss them. I can only show interest and hope someone returns the favor. 


But unfortunately we don't come to that point since it's only happened in a group chat where in the and almost everyone ask to stop sending IG reels. And we don't speak that often IRL.

This one passage will probably require hundreds of pages to unpack. But it's absolutely false. As a matter of fact, before Maidan, in 2012, pro-Russian politicians brought to power by the Kremlin passed the infamous ""Kivalov-Kolesnichenko"" law, which heavily expanded ""regional"" languages and gave more power to the Russian language. It pretty much allowed regional languages to be used as official language if more than 10% of the region spoke the language. It was revoked in 2014. The biggest thing that really changed for an average person after it was revoked was that any official forms or documents would have to be completed in the national language, Ukrainian. Which was the case anyway before 2012. Documents were done in two languages anyway - Ukrainian and Russian. Not just in the region, but throughout Ukraine. 

It affected nothing else pretty much. Russian books weren't banner, Russian TV was still available via cable or antennas if the coverage was there, and so on. 

Who really suffered in Ukraine for DECADES are people choosing to speak Ukrainian in urban areas, heavily Russified over the Soviet period. Especially in the east, in places like Donbas. People would be ridiculed and mocked. I had a colleague like that in Donetsk. She moved from Lviv with her husband for work and spoke Ukrainian her whole life. Now, the immediate circle was great, as everyone was more or less educated and a decent human being. But I'd still catch people ""from the outside"" throwing glances at her once they heard her speak. She'd often be treated with dumb ""bandera"" jokes or other stupid comments. She often spoke about harassment and bullying. 

As a mirror example, her husband was a Russian speaker who grew up in Lviv, but never really felt oppressed. 

Everything else is manufactured propaganda. Russians are good at playing the victim card and too many people buy into that shit. Remind your dad that Hitler used the same type of excuse to start WWII. ""Defending ethnic ABC\_XYZ"" and all that bullshit is nothing new.",2025-07-30T14:44:36

But she didn't want to, since she integrated in Russian community in Latvia and didn't want to be expelled from that community. So she kept spreading nonsence and beleived in what was convinient for her to keep in touch with her Russian friends. We just cut all communication with her after we were forced to leave our home in 2022 while she was preaching by the phone that Russians are good, they don't bomb our cities and came to ""liberate"" us. You can't communicate with a lunatic. P.S. I was born in Russia so I surely would have experience supposed ""repressions"" against Russians if they were real. They are not. If anything, under Russian occupation (including Soviet occupation) Ukrainians were always persecuted in Ukraine for their ethinicity just for refusing to accept Russian identity.

Fast foward to now and with the collapse of the Soviet Union, similar situation existed. Putin basically sold off on the same concept of how he needed to unite the slavic people and regain former glory. The problem is, the empire lost for good reasosn and it will not come back. This is like the last, death gasp of a once mighty empire that will make things uncomfortable for its neighbors.

Contrast this with what's happening in the USA right now. I compare USA with former Imperial Japan.

I believe Bulgaria Sofia is older than Ohrid for sure than Skopje. So there is that while moscow is not. That is first idea. Macedonia is a Greek name so they speak Bulgarian but use a Greek name and try to take both histories. I will tell you one thing though you guys are proud of inventing Cyrillic? If putin comes Bulgaria wouldn’t have invented nothing russia would have. You would speak russian. I don’t know why or what problem fyroms have with Bulgaria, I can see how your dad thinks that communism “created” them, the same way ruzzian ppl believe Ukrainians were created by communism. I would maybe lay into the fact that the fyrmaceos are taking two people’s cultures. While Ukraine is really the predecessor to the god forsaken ruzzian people. With Volodymyr in Kyiv and his three sons fighting for Kyiv and starting new settlements. So maybe a stretch you could say which is true for Ukrainians is that russians want Ukrainian history while Ukrainians don’t want their name to be linked to the atrocities of russia.

Basically I think it’s nostalgia… for a lot of old folks in Eastern Europe, life was better *for them* in the 70s and 80s. If your dad was working in the 80s, had active social life, you kids were young - and now he’s retired, social life is just hanging out with other old folks and watching tv/reading facebook… sure the 80s was better, so it’s easy to think it was because of communism. Being in the Soviet sphere but on the periphery was also way better than being in Russia itself. I mean compare growing up in Sofia in the 1960s or 70s vs let’s say Chelyabinsk (same size city in Russia) at the same time, Sofia seems like paradise by comparison. Add to that Russians are still seen in very positive light in Bulgaria because of the liberation from the Turks, so the idea of them conquering anyone causes a lot of cognitive dissonance there in particular

The main bit of advice I have is just watch “Servant of the People” with him over some rakiya. It has Zelensky playing the main character, it’s hilarious (if you grew up in old soviet republic) and it’s in Russian. Also was super popular show on Ukrainian TV in 2015-2016. So any kind of “Russians are oppressed” story is kinda obvious bs just from that

P.S. I say the show is in Russian but that’s not entirely true, it goes back and forth sometimes so quickly you can miss it. From what I remember in the opening scene Zelensky (playing a school teacher) is talking to the kids in his class in Russian, one of the kids asks a question in Ukrainian and he answers in Ukrainian, then continues in Russian, it’s seamless",2025-07-31T07:23:27

it's awful but it's true. the only method I found to be comparatively useful is asking for the source of information or articles from different countries. if the piece of news exists only in the russian or pro-russian information field — it's propaganda. 

however, it's really hard to prove that the thing doesn't work vice-versa as, by Soviet ideas, there is no chance russia would give their citizens news that are discrediting towards themselves. this thing is always the same — they claim to be the strongest and richest ever, but someone is always trying to invade them for some reason. and it's the best authoritarian tactics: if people start to suspect something in government — start a war! that's how they get carried away and start justifying their poor lifestyle.

The agency said Russian troops have repeatedly used prohibited chemical agents, including K-51, RGR, and RG-VO aerosol grenades loaded with CS (chlorobenzylidene malonitrile) and CN (chloroacetophenone), both banned irritants.

The use of such agents is prohibited under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which Russia ratified.

The SBU said the most common method of deployment involves first-person view (FPV) drones dropping chemical munitions directly onto Ukrainian defensive positions.

Upon detonation, these agents cause severe irritation to the eyes and respiratory system, often forcing Ukrainian troops to leave protected positions under active fire.

In a July 4 report, the Netherlands Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) confirmed that Russia had escalated from deploying riot control agents to using chloropicrin — a chemical capable of killing in confined spaces.

The U.S. State Department had also raised the alarm in May 2024, citing Russia's use of chloropicrin in Ukraine as one of the reasons behind the imposed sanctions against over 280 Russian individuals and entities.

Ukrainian forces previously struggled to identify the specific agents used due to a lack of detection equipment. The documentation of more than 10,000 chemical attacks underscores the scale of the threat.",2025-07-30T12:27:58

Before Trump got elected, I've seen entire comment threads deleted (like just a giant Christmas tree of [deleted]) and had one of my comments deleted before for mentioning Trump's regime will severely dampen the flow of aid to Ukraine because USA politics have nothing to do with Ukraine.

That was an example of sleepwalking into disaster and ignoring things outside that can have a domino effect on you inside.

also, if their home is gone or under occupation or unsafe, or they're culturally unacceptable to the new regime (say if putin wins), you're not sending them home, you're displacing them again. that just seems cold, impractical and unfair.

Frankly, you had better believe Ukraine is going to want as many as possible to return. Over 302,000 Syrians have returned to Syria and that country is still dealing with not insignificant amounts of violence and uncertainty. If Putin wins, which is wildly unlikely in the sense you mean it, that's a different story, their country is literally gone and they have solid claims for more permanent asylum. Otherwise, this is the way it works. When wars end, war refugees return home. Ukraine needs them to, they have a country to rebuild and part of that rebuilding is getting back the talent that fled overseas. Otherwise you're just moralizing brain drain. Ill thought out. May be more comfortable to not have to return, but thems the breaks and ultimately it's in Ukraine's best interests that as many as possible return when the fighting is over.",2025-07-30T21:51:13

some countries force returns, sure, but others allow people to stay. that’s the more humane route, isn’t it? i get that showing humanity is out of fashion these days, no shade, just observation of trends in society, sadly in my opinion.",2025-07-30T21:57:36

You end up spending way more in aid and temporary shelter than if everyone just keeps working and moving back home as they find jobs, as buildings are rebuilt, as hospitals regain capacity, as schools regain capacity, as areas are demined, and so on.

Ukraine would probably do something like repatriot X hundred or X thousand at a time in each city or oblast (or whatever), with some number of each job sector being rebooted at a time at rates housing and economics could accommodate, and at some point two to four years down the road the host countries would then be able to just let residencies expire 'naturally' to close out the process.",2025-07-31T08:22:37

Forty-four people were injured and hospitalized, and more than 50 were provided medical assistance on the spot, the authorities said. The State Criminal-Executive Service previously reported one staff member among the injured victims.

Moscow's forces struck the Zaporizhzhia district eight times with FAB bombs overnight, destroying prison buildings and damaging nearby houses, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.

The prison facility in Bilenke, a village around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Zaporizhzhia, was hit by four bombs at around 11:30 p.m. on July 28, according to the State Criminal-Executive Service.

""The perimeter of the institution was not damaged; there is no threat of escape,"" the service said.

Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets denounced the attack as a ""gross violation of international humanitarian law and yet another proof of Russia's war crimes.""

""People held in places of detention do not lose their right to life and protection,"" Lubinets said on Telegram.

As of spring, Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating over 150,000 suspected war crimes committed by Russia during its all-out war.

Russia has occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast since the onset of its full-scale invasion in 2022, subjecting the rest of its territories to daily aerial and artillery attacks.",2025-07-29T11:15:00

Add it to the list of reasons he doesn’t have the right temperament to be president. These reasons—for me—automatically disqualified him long before all the details about his sexual assaults, raping, racism, xenophobia, sexism, and anti-American behavior ever entered the picture.

He’s weak. He’s dumb. He’s hot-headed. He’s a bully. He has no self-control. He doesn’t think before speaking.

TSN Uncovers Identities Behind Olenivka Prison Massacre

""TSN investigative journalists were able to identify four individuals linked to the incident. Notably, three of them were later officially awarded Russian military honors.""

Likely mastermind behind the attack is Kostiantin Popov, with ugly scum subordinates carrying out the massacre:

* Captain of the Internal Service Andrey Gavrylyuk – explosives technician and instructor of Assault Unit No. 1, Special Task Unit of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Stavropol Krai  
* Lieutenant of the Internal Service Daniil Batishchev – explosives technician and instructor of Assault Unit No. 2, Special Task Unit of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Stavropol Krai  
* Major of the Internal Service Vladimir Kondratenko – explosives technician and instructor of Assault Unit No. 3, Special Task Unit of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Krasnodar Krai.

All three individuals were mentioned in a commendation letter dated August 1, 2022 – just two days after the tragedy.",2025-07-28T14:58:20

The UK in particular also provided very valuable training support, and broke the 'taboos' on supplying longer range weapons (Stormshadows) and MBTs (Challengers).  The NLAWs and Starstreaks the UK supplied in the very early days of the war when Ukraine was struggling to get *any* modern equipment were also of some use, no?

I don't know about France, but the UK doesn't have large stockpiles of anything. The UK has run down it's military over the decades, and relied on the US side of the NATO umbrella possibly more than it should have. They have about 150-ish tanks that could be operationally ready 'quickly', and that has been stated to be a 30 day prep period. So those 14 tanks were almost 10% of what the UK currently has operationally ready.

At first…I just wanted to ask for opinions or ‚feelings‘ regarding that topic and NOT to offend someone.   
In addition to the 'binary moment' in the sense of ‚all or nothing‘, I wanted to make another distinction here between “spoken words vs. actual deeds.” Sure, a lot of countries did a lot over the years; my point was just not to loose focus on what really matters: ""Guns, lots of Guns"" (Matrix 😏).

The problem though is that the vast majority of Russians are collectively incapable of concluding that it'd be their own gоddаmnеd kind who's forcing them to feed bark soup to the kids.

Given the caste-system that the Russians proudly defend as their society, an internal revolt could plausibly happen only once the ""right"" kind of Russians in the caste-system are forced into such dire straits, namely the рrіvіІеgеd bоugіеѕ in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Otherwise Russians as a whole would be apt to find a way to rationalize their self-inflicted misery by applying ""[Good Czar, bad boyars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Tsar,_bad_Boyars)"" or blaming Ukrainians, NATO or Americans.

A Russian, Arkadiy Babchenko, touched on this very subject of his countrymen's unforgivable inability to understand cause-and-effect as the rest of the world uses it.

&gt;*If you asked me to characterise the “Russian World” (Russky mir) in one word, I would not hesitate to call it infantilism. This term best describes the current state of Russian society.*

&gt;*Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.*

&gt;*It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:*

&gt;*“The Americans let the price of oil fall. The Americans organised a revolution in Ukraine. America hates Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and Ііbеrаlѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brothers stole all the money. But Putin is good.”*

&gt;*There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.*

&gt;*Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.*

&gt;*In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.*",2025-07-24T21:37:41

Except for we need to draw a clear line that we in the grown up world won't excuse such behaviour because they've got EQ of a toddler. Or really they need to be shown what conscequences look like (between sanctions and Ukranian precision strikes, We're on the way), teach them like toddlers then.

That said I'm not surprised. As a nation they were never forced to own up to what they've done and take responsibility. They've never even apologised to the countries they occupied and murdered their way through during USSR. Instead they got US aid during 90s 🤦‍♀️
Compare that to modern Germany. If conscequences aren't delivered and taken responsibility for, nothing changes. This cycle of brutality and violence must end",2025-07-24T22:32:55

For some reason, this sub blocks any post which links to the URL even though it's not from a Russian domain.

On your point about the Russians' refusal to face up to their long and sordid history of atrocities, [counterintelligence officers from the Baltic States have noted much the same](https://vsquare.org/baltic-counterintelligence-officers-russia-cruelty-war-history/) when the Russians escalated their extermination efforts in 2022.

&gt;*However, officers of the Baltic security services do not describe Russia’s imperialism and brutality as a military tactic, but a rampant social norm.*

&gt;*„I believed that their mentality changed over the years and they had a reckoning after the war. That would have been normal,“ Jauniškis says. „But I was mistaken:“*

&gt;*Indeed, how could Russia have any reckoning when the country has never been held responsible? The Nazis temporarily rose to the top of the cruelty ranking during the Second World War, which has caused people to forget Russia’s atrocities.*

&gt;*„They’ve never been held accountable,“ Sinisalu says. „And that has made them feel invincible.“*

  
N.B. ""Jauniškis"" is Darius Jauniškis, Director of the Lithuanian State Security Department. ""Sinisalu"" is Arnold Sinisalu, Director General of the Estonian Internal Security Service.

BTW, the full interview with these officers from the Baltic States in the link is worth reading if you haven't done so. It should be rammed down the throats of the know-it-all Russophiles and obnoxious white-knights among us who *still* insist that we in the civilized world should keep playing nice with the 140 million+ guardians of the Neo-GоІdеn Ноrdе who have meanwhile revealed repeatedly and unironically what they *really* fight and stand for.",2025-07-25T15:32:13

That's been a big part of the problem hasn't it (especially in cases like Merkel's post-Crimean invasion Nord Stream 2). It's human nature, in a way, to superimpose your own world view and imagine others are mostly similar. It goes both ways too: psychologically, I can sort of see why russians don't believe in the natural protests that occur in our countries and say it's all paid agitators - because they themselves have this submissive mentality and apathy that stands between them and fighting for what's right (if they even know what is). So they envision us as the same, they don't *believe* the world we live in.

It's also human nature and even *rational* for a person to learn from experience. In the case of dealing with Russians, it's rational for someone to adjust behavior for the future based on whether one has been stabbed in the back or treated civilly by the Russians.

The inconvenient truth (inconvenient for Russians and their simps worldwide, that is) is that centuries worth of Russian treachery and depravity have made non-Russians, ""Russian-aware"" if not hostile to Russians. Russians, in their uniquely socially-clueless way, consciously try to flip the table on others' rationality by deliberately miscasting these reactions as ""Russo**phobia**"", as if non-Russians' reactions were irrational and products of the imagination or personal histrionics.",2025-07-25T17:48:01

Russia advances because Ukraine has only a handful of men manning fortified positions. They attack with just assault rifles and it works.

No, you need combined arms - rifle, machine gun, mortar, drones, artillery, armor, aviation, air defense etc. And every piece trained to work together

War is everything but simple yet the choice for Ukraine should be easy. Sacrifice now and stay independent or lose. It is sort of black or white decision. West can be blamed for inadequate support but that is not going to change the fact that it is sacrifice or lose moment.

If you have a manpower shortage, and you give your men less weapons than is needed to survive on a battlefield, they're gonna get slaughtered, which only makes your manpower shortage worse, because now you lost the weapons you gave to those men who just died.

So its worse overall.

Trading 1:1, even for a short time in Ukraine's position, is not acceptable, Ukraine does not have the ability or advantage to do something like that, while yes, Russia was humiliated in the last three years, we still have to remember, Russia has more of everything Ukraine needs, every man, bullet and shell, is vital for Ukraine, and losing them unnecessarily is just not acceptable, especially when Ukraine is trying to win the war.",2025-07-26T03:07:45

Unfortunately they've demonstrated repeatedly that they are still able to take ground through small unit infantry assaults rather than armored spearheads. In fact, practically the only way they've taken ground in the past year or two has been through small unit infantry attacks. The downside of this strategy is that it results in very high casualties. But Russia has a strong ability to shrug off casualties. 

Their bottleneck at this point is very likely to be financial, at some point they won't be able to keep paying these very high signing bonuses and then they'll start running out of men, but when that will actually happen is unclear. Some people are saying late 2025 or early 2026, but those are just guesses. 

Drone warfare has also definitely changed the game here, armored vehicles still have a big role to play on the modern battlefield but only if they're covered by anti drone units, and right now neither side has shown an ability to consistently provide cover to armored units. There's a reason why Ukraine is always asking for AD assets and drones rather than more tanks.",2025-07-25T14:31:35

In 2012, a cop sold data to Yanukovych’s security team - a common practice back then. After the 2014 revolution, that cop joined NABU.  

In 2023, the SBU (Security Service) accused him of being a ""russian mole"" because someone he once helped later defected to Russia, even though there was **no proof** he was involved in treason.  

After a two-year investigation, the SBU found **no evidence** but still smeared him in the media, making it seem like he was a wartime spy.

&gt;An ""independent"" office/structure is not outside the law

Absolutely, in case there is any real suspicion about a NABU detective comiting a crime - they should be investigated. That's what happened in this case (even though there were no real reasons for investigation), **nothing was found**.

The whole point of NABU is its independence. How are they supposed to investigate, for example, the attorney general, when they are controlled directly by the attorney general?",2025-07-23T15:51:49

Second - yes, corrupt officials should get fired, and replaced with officials who are not corrupt.

What does it have to do with subordinate anti-corruption agencies to the Prosecutor General's Office, completely destroying the core feature they were created for - their independence. The very feature that could allow them to be effective.

The proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code solve none of their efficiency problems. Instead, anti-corruption bodies are being handed over to manual control by those who, throughout Ukraine's independence, failed to fight corruption but somehow became very good at leading it.  

You don’t trust NABU and SAP? Fine. Now they’re being subordinated to the Prosecutor General's Office - an institution we all trust so much that we’ve got enough leftover trust for three more just like it, apparently.

An office that has always been effective, independent, and never once caught up in corruption - hell, not even seen standing near corrupt officials in the smoking area. (s)

The glorious traditions of honesty and effectiveness among Ukraine’s Prosecutors General stretch all the way from Kuzmin and Pshonka to Ryaboshapka and ""prosecutor is my guy"" Venediktova.

So this whole nonsense about NABU being unlikely corrupt - more corrupt than the SBU or the Prosecutor General’s Office - and the only solution being to destroy NABU’s independence is pure bullshit. If John filled your car with donkey piss, you drain the piss, clean the tank, refuel with gas, and drive on. You don’t hand the keys back to John and ride off into the sunset on a dead donkey.  

Corruption won’t fight itself. Corrupt officials won’t jail themselves. Without independent anti-corruption bodies, this whole thing is a farce.",2025-07-23T19:56:56

With amount of shit going under the curtain and unknown neither to public, journalists nor to me, i honestly think - if it was about investigations purely …some key people responsible for it would just disappear after workday over as my godfather from fishcontrol (State Agency for Fisheries of Ukraine or smth like that correctly) only to be found killed in some suv in other oblast in the middle of nowhere.

Look at European conditions if you want to. You will mostly not find any authority that can operate completely freely without gouvernmental survey. If there is something operating somehow independently, this will be cut off the moment the ruZZian infiltration will set in.

You are still new to democracy and to separation of powers.

It's a normal thing that the gouvernment as the executive power controls every gouvernmental authority. Nothing out of the world.

There is the judicial power that limits the gouvernmental control, though, in case it's against the constitution and the general legal system.

If things go completely wrong, the legislative branch will give new guidelines to the other branches of power.

Since you don't live here I will excuse your ignorance.

Since the very first days his team was embroidered in corruption scandals, in the first year the corruption index got worse signifying a reversal of the 5-year trend of constant improvement. It bounced back up but stopped improving. For someone who was campaigning on anti-corruption this was devastating and his approval rating before the war dipped below 20%. He lashed out at government institutions, was trying to gain control over them and was fighting people who were spearheading reforms. His political career seemed to be over.

War changed his positions on many things almost overnight and he was finally seen as a pro-Ukrainian politician and not as he himself put it as someone ""who doesn't care"". But the corruption efforts were not top priority anymore and he wasn't really judged on them.

Until this week when he went back to his 20%-approval days and similar actions. People haven't forgotten his efforts to undermine democratic institutions back then and don't want to let him forget.",2025-07-23T22:40:16

As unpleasant and unexpected as it was, I fully expect to see this was an emergency measure as the anti-corruption bodies themselves had reportedly been tainted by corruption and actors behaving to the detriment of Ukraine.

It wouldn’t surprise me if people in some senior EU positions were aware beforehand.

Nor will it surprise me to see the AC bodies returned to independent authority once the criminals have been purged.

Drastic situations sometimes require drastic measures for which the motivations are not always understood by those outside of the decision makers.

And in the middle of a war for your very survival, I don’t think there’s the opportunity to go through the years of procedure like the EU does.

First of all, it reduces morale ('why do we have to fight and die when the president tries to usurp the power and not being responsible for his actions?')


Second, it won't be left unanswered, and will likely end up with reducing the international assistance (because many international institutions that provide assistance are already fed up with the cycle 'institution provides assistance in exchange of reforms - Zelensky promises reforms - the parliament votes for some batshit proposal - institution said that's not okay - the parliament scrambles at the last moment and retracts the batshit, often with some tiny pieces of bat crap stuck in corners').


Ukraine already had failed several critical checkpoints in reforms because of that. And it's not okay. Compared to the tempo of 2022 when Ukraine often moved ahead of the plan and passed the checks long before the deadline. Looks like having russian troops in proximity to the precious parliament asses is deeply invigorating - maybe they should move to Zaporizhya or Kherson for regular sessions?

A reminder of the USAian civil war over slavery: The soldiers went to war to free the enslaved; the government went to war to control the economy. Slavery, while great for the plantation owners, is terrible for a national economy. There's economic incentives to abolish slavery. The enslaved don't pay taxes, and aren't good consumers. From the perspective of running a country, it's a terrible system. Which is also why Catherine the Great of Russia abolished slavery, by the way.

The propaganda, however, makes it very clear that the soldiers and their support were mobilized with moral and ethical arguments. 'The enslaved don't pay taxes' isn't going to convince anyone to fight. Pamflets showing pictures of enslaved children, and the famous photographs of Peter, The Scourged Back... Now *that* would get a young citizen's blood boiling and trigger finger itching. Rightfully so, of course. I'm just saying that the interests of the general public and the interest of their country as an institution weren't necessarily aligned.

I'm gonna be real honest: the countries that support Ukraine don't do it out of democratic principle. Sure, sure, our politicians do want to score brownie points with the voter, absolutely. But the support is also simply a matter of self-defense by proxy.

Ukraine's gotten a lot of financial support from especially the EU, in return for tackling their corruption problem. This is because the EU wanted to invest in Ukraine for mostly economic reasons. Ukraine has wheat and oil aplenty. But if your investment is disappearing into the pockets of criminals, then that's no use. Would Ukraine benefit from better relations with the EU, even membership? Absolutely. It's a win-win situation. But it's a *win-win* situation; the EU wouldn't do it if it didn't also win.

I was always, like since late primary school, as soon as I became aware of politics, leaning against my (Croatian) government and the ruling party as they’ve constantly exercised authoritarianism, deeply rooted corruption and have acted very soft on our own war crimes (during that specific war in the 1990s our soldiers did commit significantly less war crimes than Serbian forces but me and everyone around me was of the opinion that we need to act better than our enemies, and hence crimes from our side should have been processed by ourselves - hint: they were not but we fought for it nevertheless).

Our effort was never against our own country nor for the benefit of our enemy. It was for us to be better and not use excuse of the war to not improve ourselves. I have never ceased to support our forces and our fight for freedom, and if anything - if we were faced with real and existential danger that our internal fight would give Serbia opportunity to prevail we would hold it off for later. Because even our shitty wartime government was better than the occupation of foreign aggressor.

No, Zelenskyy is not a dictator, nor wants to grab the power forever, and no this law won't ""legalize corruption"" as I've read somehwere.

First, NABU has been doing jackshit against corruption for years, and second they've find out it was compromised by russia, wich ain't strange at all, since this is one of the things that could harm Ukraine more.

Putting the agency and the anti-corruption prosecutor's office under control of the prosecutor general, while not desirable in normal times, can be necessary because of this _""crazy little thing called war"",_ you know? The same as suspending the elections, curfews, mobilizations and some rights suspended. There is a martial law for a good reason. It is a legal possibility contemplated in many democratic countries legal system and Ukraine is not using it for no reason.

Sure, it may look bad and the timing may not be the best (when would it be, then?), but if a state agency is found out to be infiltrated by russians, it needs to be surveyed, full stop. Is an independent agency really independent if it is compromised by the same enemy that is invading your country and killing your people?

And yes, some officials of the EU have made some statements about being concerned and yadda, yadda, but that is to be expected. Yes, fight against corruption is one of the key things for EU integration, as it is being a democracy... yet the EU understands and supports the suspension of elections during wartime, and they will do the same with this. 

And it's not that there is no corruption in the EU either, let's not be hypocrates. As a Spaniard I can swear there is indeed a lot of it, and I'm sure any other citizen from many EU countries here (if not all !!) can say the same. Some countries more than others, sure (I'm looking at you... and you...) 

And no, this is not to apologize corruption, but trust the fucking man and give him some breath. Zelenskyy may not be perfect and may make some mistakes (who doesn't?) , but he has done more for the EU integration than any other president in Ukraine's independent history. Not to mention how would Ukraine be right now if he had fled at the beggining of the full scale invasion instead of staying and fighting, and the job he's being doing these years to gather internarional support for Ukraine, even withstanding humilliations by trump and his minions. Would Ukraine even exist as an independent country right now? If it was about power and money, he could have make a deal with putin back in 2019 and become ""Ukraine's lukashenko"", and I'm sure he may have had some offers under the table.

Are the anti-corruption agencies flawed? Definitely, but stripping all meaningful powers the agency have and declaring the government can redirect investigations to however they want sounds like a self-defeating concept. This is a very different matter of their government raidiing known corrupt members and demanding the anti-corruption agencies get their affairs in better order. 

The Ukrainian people could've protested for a lot of different reasons, but the fact that thousands of Ukrainians have taken to the streets this quickly is pretty telling. Openly defying curfew runs obvious heightened risks, but that happening should be an indication of how the public is not messing around with this.

It also very much leaves the door open for the govt to do the old ""we investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong"" kind of shit to happen unless they restore its independence.

This is also fresh ammo for Ukraine's political enemies. Their disinformation is most dangerous is when it's grounded in facts, which in this case is that the people are sensing a power grab.  

I'm not saying that a better outcome is impossible, but the people have a right to real answers and that their agencies maintain independence and their government or Zelensky himself have a duty to give serious answers to the public.

The fact that someone in that agency has been found to have links with russians and the agency isn't doing shit about it (whether making a blind eye on purpose or due to incompetence, that I don't know), is nothing to be neglected. Russia's war is not only on the battelfield, it's hybrid, and that includes infiltrating people in key offices like this. Also, can we consider that agency truly independent when someone inside is found to have links with the enemy? To me that would be, at the very least, quite debatable.

This can make a lot of damage to Ukraine and needs to be taken care of. Whether this could be adressed in a different manner or not, that I don't know. Maybe. But something had to be done, and I don't think the intention is to be more permissive with corruption or a grab of power at all.

And yes, I'm sure russian disinformation is going to use it as ammo to distabilize Ukraine, but they would use anything anyway. One thing and the opposite as well.

&gt;The Prosecutor General's Office, the Security Service of Ukraine ([SBU](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/sbu/)), and the State Investigation Bureau conducted at least 70 searches in premises connected to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau ([NABU](https://kyivindependent.com/tag/nabu/)), which investigates top-level corruption.

&gt;The opened probes target at least 15 NABU employees. Most of the cases involve traffic accidents, while some of the NABU employees are also accused of having links to Russia.

Also, the way that Mr. Prosecutor General, the guy who now has total control fo NABU says this about the trafic violations. This guy has been in his office since 18.06.2025:

&gt;""I saw that there are proceedings that have been, frankly, lying around for a year, with conducted examinations, with interrogated witnesses, there are victims. From Saturday to Sunday, a prosecutor's employee hit a person to death – I went to court. A person killed a person and must be held accountable before the law. And there are NABU employees who caused a road accident, as a result of which there are victims with harm to health – some without internal organs, some with other harm to health. This is life – each of us can commit a road accident with some consequences for another person's health. But everyone is equal before the law.

Most of the cases (traffic accidents) while some others (accused of links with russia). According to that quote, there's literally two different causes there.

&gt;I don't know what he means with ""hit a person to death"".

&gt;From Saturday to Sunday, a prosecutor's employee hit a person to death

Probably a weird translation. As I understand, someone ""hit"" (ran over with the car) someone else and killed him, ""from Saturday to Sunday"" (on the night from Saturday to Sunday).

Despite that, if the cops pull someone on a red light but find a corpse in the car, should they let the guy go with just a ticket, or should they arrest him and investigate? 

And even if the traffic accidents issue is just an excuse to get the evidences on the other two guys, so what? Law forces use excuses and traps to get to their suspects everywhere. 

If the main intention was targeting the NABU and seizing control of it from start, I think using the accidents for it would be quite absurd.

When you have some personnel, even more if they have certain rank or are in some key posts, who are or have been informants for russia or trading whatever with them, of course the agency is fucking compromised.

And you didn't provide any source for it. So it's your word against SBU and the court's one.

&gt;He leaked some data five years before joining NABO (ten years ago), to someone who was NOT a recruited russian agent (was recruited five years later). 

Leaking data illegaly alone should by defaut make him inelegible to work in an anti-corruption agency, to start with. And if the data was leaked to someone who, even if later, became a recruited russian agent, that should ring a bell immediatly. Only for that, the guy shouldn't be working there. If that is not a big red flag, I don't know what it is.

And that regardeless of what else he could or couldn't have done or leaked once in office.

&gt;As you can see, they're really spinning this one hard to make it look worse.

No, I can't see it because you haven't provided anything but your word, and no offense, but I don't know you nor know what credibility do you have.

&gt;NABU has never had any personnel who are or have been informants for russia, according to the SBU.

That guy is arrested and accused by the court of spying for russia.

""According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, the suspect allegedly carried out espionage on behalf of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB).""

[Euromaidan press.](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/07/22/kyiv-court-arrests-suspected-russian-spy-embedded-in-anti-graft-bureau/)

&gt;no, it doesn't.

Of course it is.

&gt;SBU is much more compromised if that was the case

And when somene is found suspicious to be compromised, it's taken care of, arrested and sent to the court. Why would it be different with NABU ?

&gt;Yeah - why wouldn't you trust NABU? 

Why would I? NABU has been caught with, at the very least, a big security fail and all I hear from them is denying their responsability. That is not to say the whole agency or its heads are necessarily involved actively on spionage or whatever, but it's still a negligence.

&gt;You seem to trust the ones attacking them.

Your choice of words is significant. Is there any proof that this is a deliberate attack on NABU? 

Because so far what I see is the security forces and court arresting and accusing two guys suspect of spying for or trading with russia (whether they are found guilty or not it's the court to decide after investigation or trial), and the Rada taking care of the issue at a political level by putting the agency under surveillance. Surely not in the best way possible, but still.

I have no reason to be more leaned on one side or the other, but what I'm seeing here so far is a big fail on one part (NABU) and the other part (SBU and court) making their job and taking care of it, while the Rada and governement try, very clumsily, to take control of the situation so it doesn't happen again.

If you have any proof that this is a political attack to prevent NABU from making its job in order to benefit someone, as you seem to be suggesting, you're free to go to the court with them and accuse whomever you consider responsible. Otherwise it's just conspiracy theories.

&gt;That's a lie, the SBU never gave NABU any advice about not employing the guy. On the contrary - they informed NABU that he hasn't communicated with russia and isn't a spy.

Again, you acuse everybody of lying but you don't even provide a source backing such a statement. I quoted or linked press articles (from Babel.ua in my previous comment and Euromaidan press in this one) reporting on the issue and quoting both sides and their versions of the story. If you have a better source (or any at all) to back your statements, I'd like to see it since so far it's just your word. 

And in a situation where, at this point, we have the word of NABU against the word of SBU and the court, and until further evidence on one sense or the other is made public, I'm going to stick with SBU and the court's word for now, because at the very, very least, the two arrested guys' records and the fact that the first guy's contact is currently a known russian agent, is quite suspicious.

So again, before keep accusing everyone of lying, and falling into a _conspiranoia,_ could you provide at least your sources, so people can see them and check their credibility? Who knows, maybe you're right and I'm wrong, but I won't accept your word just because.

&gt;And that's how it should be - anyone breaking the law should be prosecuted and fired

This is the only thing we're going to agree, I'm afraid.

It's NABU's word, not mine.

&gt; Leaking data illegaly alone should by defaut make him inelegible to work in an anti-corruption agency, to start with

Oh, 100%. He would need to at least be indicted first, though. But the claim that NABU is compromised by russia is still a lie. 

&gt; No, I can't see it because you haven't provided anything but your word

NABU's word, not mine.

&gt; That guy is arrested and accused by the court of spying for russia.

This is a lie. He was not accused of spying for russia by the court. He is accused by the prosecutioner's office - the very institution carrying out the attack (together with the SBU). But when you look into the details, it becomes crystal clear that he was never spying for russia based on SBU's evidence that they presented to NABU.

&gt; Again, you acuse everybody of lying but you don't even provide a source backing such a statement. I quoted or linked press articles (from Babel.ua in my previous comment and Euromaidan press in this one) reporting on the issue and quoting both sides and their versions of the story. If you have a better source (or any at all) to back your statements, I'd like to see it since so far it's just your word.

You can look up official statements from NABU and SAP yourself.

&gt; Of course it is.

No, it doesn't. This guy doing something illegal ten years ago doesn't make NABU compromised as fuck.

&gt; And when somene is found suspicious to be compromised, it's taken care of, arrested and sent to the court. Why would it be different with NABU ?

It shouldn't - it should be the same (the guy prosecuted for their crimes, instead of the institution being gutted).

&gt; Why would I? NABU has been caught with, at the very least, a big security fail and all I hear from them is denying their responsability. That is not to say the whole agency or its heads are necessarily involved actively on spionage or whatever, but it's still a negligence.

Because NABU has been much more trustworthy than SBU or GPO historically. 

&gt; If you have any proof that this is a political attack to prevent NABU from making its job in order to benefit someone, as you seem to be suggesting, you're free to go to the court with them and accuse whomever you consider responsible. Otherwise it's just conspiracy theories.

LOL which court is that? I will do even better - let the government know directly on the street.

&gt; So again, before keep acusing everyone of lying and falling into a conspiranoia, could you provide at least your sources, so people can see them and check their credibility?

Check our NABU's official communication channels yourself.

&gt; I don't think the institution is being dismantled.

That's because you don't know why it was created and why it had to be a separate institution, along with a separate anti-corruption prosecutioner's office, and a separate anti-corruption court.

They pushed through a resolution in record time, allegedly violating procedures and laws, that just so happens to give the government (in theory) complete immunity from investigations by an institution that is supposed to investigate corruption. 

Your intent can be to protect Ukraine and hunt down Russian Spies AND, while your at it, increase the protections your politicans have against prosecution. Both is possible. Zelensky might be doing it to keep things together but that doesn't change how it looks and what effects it will have. Are they going to change it back in the future? I don't know. Nothing says that they will. 

Once these things are done they will be extremely difficult to change in the future. It took the Euromaidan to get them established. How will they reestablish them in the future? You can't argue everything you do with the fight against Russia. It doens't give you a pass to destory things you or your friends don't like. We have no evidence right now that NABU was unrecoverably comprimised. 

The protests are justified. They put the government in their place and force them to respond. Nothing happens without pressure.

One excample: **NABU's output in 2023**

&gt;2023 was the most successful year for anti-corruption authorities since their establishment. NABU and SAPO uncovered misdeeds involving 21 individuals among the senior officials of the state, 39 heads of state-owned enterprises, 16 judges, and 11 MPs. The economic effect of NABU and SAPO's activities in 2023 amounted to UAH 4.7 billion, which is one and a half times higher than in 2022.

Also, the extend of Russian Influence in NABU remains to be proven. Not that there is none, but you need some good evidence when the consequence is gutting the independence of it. 

&gt;Zelenskyy may not be perfect and may make some mistakes (who doesn't?) , but he has done more for the EU integration than any other president in Ukraine's independent history

That may be true but by downplaying the effect of institutions like NABU you are elevating the current administration and Zelenskyy purely by omission. Its a reach and I appologise if I interpreted to far. But in war there are many battlefields and you even have to question the people you like if they go too far.

To prove the extent of russian influence on them, courts are necessary and for that investigations and in this case, arrests as well, must be made. Even if the russian influence is not reaching the whole agency or their head, the case against these two guys is serious enough to consider that, at the very least, there has been a flagrant failure on the security checks, and that shows at least incompetence and negligence. 

In any normal situation, I would by no means support cutting the independence of any anti-corruption agency, but this is no any normal situation.

Steps that just so happen to strengthen the parlaments resistance to corruption investigations cannot be excused by ""but Russia"". If its just about the Russian Threat. why give the procecutor general the power to kill every corruption investigation while saying ""we will not interfere with their investigations"". It does not make sense. 

&gt;Responding to questions about whether the Prosecutor General should have the authority to sign off on indictments against top officials investigated by SAPO, Kravchenko invoked the rule of law:

&gt;“The President proposed my candidacy, Parliament approved it, and Parliament was elected by the people. If you don’t support certain members of Parliament, that’s a matter for the voters. This is the legal framework of a rule-of-law state,” he said.,

USSR murdered 62 million people, and 55 million was domestic. Their own people, that's what's happens when the dark side wins. How can even Russians accept this?

Now you know by historic numbers why 1 million dead in Putins special military operation, means absolutely nothing for him.

In Russian history this is just small change, it has no relevans at all. Just an incident, not even a peak in history.

Second is China. They murdered 35 million of their own people. If you count both regimes, you can add 10 millions more, rising to 45 million. Now you know why they dont give a damn about what people think domestically or in Hong Kong or Taiwan.

Third, The German Third Reich. 21 million people, but only 0.7 million domestically. That doesn't make them better, but we always talk about Hitler as the mass murderer of the 20th century, numbers say that he is not he is nothing compared to USSR and China. Its not even half of chinas domestic disputes.

This give a scale of what we are up against in Europe, there is nothing such ""We cannot afford 5% defense budget"", this must be recognized.

We do keep neo-Nazis down as soon as it pops up, but Neo USSR is not for the weak politicians to handle.

Neo USSR (Novorossiya) they only understand superior violence against them.

Have a look at the numbers, understans history in the EU and Asia Pacific,  then you understand the current geo political situation. This is the mentality, peace love and good will with eco sugar on top helps no one.",2025-07-18T09:38:26

But, we’ve also been told by the victors the numbers of deaths and who was responsible for them. The USSR was one of the victors. And in their history lessons they teach that ww2 was their great patriotic war, and their victory over Nazi germany. And in those lessons they never mention that Stalin was allied with Hitler in the beginning, and they split Poland, and wreaked havoc on that country and their own prior to fighting against one another. Stalin caused the holodomor, which was arguably right up there with the Jewish holocaust inflicted by Nazi germany. 

So yes we’ve been told who was the worry of a century, but we’ve also been lied to and misinformed by powers outside our control. There isn’t a one is worse than the other, and we in the west are left with becoming just as bad to fix the issue with evil. 60 million died for Nazi Germany’s ambitions to provide 80 years of relative calm, regional conflicts excluded of course we’ve never known real peace in the world, but to fix the evil and bring another period of calm will need triple the wasted lives at least.",2025-07-18T12:08:18

But it was definitely in the millions.

The Soviet regime was also horrendous but their numbers in this post are inflated. Many of the ridiculously high numbers like 60 million are blaming things like casualties in ww2 on the Soviet Union rather than the Nazis. 

The true numbers are more likely to be around 7 million deaths as a result of deliberate actions(Gulags, murders, mass executions, holodomor) and then 20 million total as a result of other things like incompetence leading to famine or terrible war strategy. 

I don’t see the point in exaggerating the death toll of the Soviet Union. It is horrific without needing to inflate the numbers.",2025-07-18T14:18:36

The only other time that could have caused such a large number of deaths would be Lenin and his rule, but at this time it’s hard to tell what’s a result of Soviet policy and general chaos and civil war.

Other genocidal regimes devastated an area, or followed a policy that ""just so happened"" to hit an ethnicity particularily bad.

For example Ukrainians suffered terribly under Stalin's rule, but those Ukrainians who lived outside the Holodomor areas were relatively save (as much as anyone anywhere could be under Stalin). Even within Ukraine farmers could theoretically survive by somehow procuring enough food to fullfill Russia's ridiculously high quotas. And once Ukraine was sufficiently devastated to not be able to question Moscow's rule Moscow more or less did not care that Ukrainians had survived.

Nazi Germany by contrast would seek Jews out no matter where they lived within the areas they ruled. They would even press countries they did not directly rule (Hungary, Italy) to exterminate or hand over their jews. Genocide was not a means to an end that they would stop employing once that end was reached, killing jews was the end in itself, even overriding pressing war needs.",2025-07-26T00:11:43

The Japanese killed vast numbers of civilians in all the territories they occupied.

Take the infamous Thailand-Burma death railway.  Most have heard of the mass deaths of POW's.  What's not mentioned is the hundreds of thousands of Asian laborers (primarily from Thailand, Burma, Malaysia, and other parts of Southeast Asia) forced to work on the railway.

For example, of the 100,000 Malayan Tamils forced to work on the railway, around 60,000 perished.  That's a death rate of 60%",2025-07-18T14:22:23

No, famine &amp; drought wouldn't be considered democide/genocide unless the famine is orchestrated (such as the Holodomor). 

The data references democide, which is murder of civilians by their government through genocide, mass murder (which would include orchestrated famines).

Looking at the time period mentioned for the UK, I'm going to assume this includes deaths in the Indian British Raj, as well as the Boer war (in South Africa).",2025-07-18T11:14:24

&gt;The reason Britain did not give food aid in December 1942 is clear. The allies were losing the battle of the Atlantic: U-boats were sinking so many ships that there was a distinct possibility that the United Kingdom would have to surrender, which would have been disastrous for the rest of the world, not least the USSR and India. Winston Churchill was later to state: ‘The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land, at sea or in the air depended ultimately on its outcome’ (Costello &amp; Hughes, \[1977\]. ‘The supply situation in Britain was such there was talk of being unable to continue the war, with supplies of fuel being particularly low’ (Costello &amp; Hughes, \[1977\]

In short, each province was to an extent it's own country looking after it's own people first.

&gt;I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India and its possible reactions on our joint operations. Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal through which at least 700,000 people died. This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms which have inflicted serious damage on the Indian spring crops. India’s shortage cannot be overcome by any possible surplus of rice even if such a surplus could be extracted from the peasants. Our recent losses in the Bombay explosion have accentuated the problem.

&gt;...

&gt;I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia without reducing the assistance you are now providing for us, who are at a positive minimum if war efficiency is to be maintained. We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships.",2025-07-18T13:01:44

*** USA 1776 - 1900:

Obviously the best example is American Indians but would have to be the 1776-1900 period since prior to 1776 it must be under the UK flag. It appears this number in total is under 100,000, probably closer to 50,000 including 5,000 on the trail of tears.  This is barely a blip on the radar for this table.  

Civil War was a bit different.  Conditions were horrible and many soldiers died in POW camps due to dysentery than battle.  Natchez Mississippi, Richmond VA, and Memphis Tennessee were put under horrible sieges (with Atlanta GA burned down), killing thousands of civilians. Famine was rampant at times. We can put Civil War related deaths at 1M being super generous; however, a much smaller amount would have been intentional genocide and maybe 100,000 civilians would be this number.  There was post Civil War food shortage that killed a few thousand in the South too.  

So USA is maybe 100,000 1776-1990 (Indians) and 100,000 1860-1865 (civil war).  These are guesstimates.  

*** USA in 1900-2000:

One would think Vietnam would register but intentional killings of Vietnamese would have been incredibly limited.  Iraq War would have killed many civilians but probably not intentionally.  Any takers on this one?

WW2 —- there were significant deaths from starvation and malnutrition among Germans in the immediate aftermath of World War II, particularly during 1945 and 1946. The war had devastated Germany's infrastructure, disrupted food production, and led to severe shortages of essential supplies.

In the winter of 1945-46, the situation was dire, with millions of displaced persons, returning soldiers, and refugees adding pressure to an already strained food supply. The Allied occupation forces struggled to provide adequate food aid, and the harsh winter exacerbated the crisis. Estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Germans may have died from starvation or related health issues during this period.  Occupied by the US, have to factor this in?

By 1948, the situation began to improve with the introduction of the Marshall Plan and various economic reforms, which helped stabilize food supplies and promote recovery. 

*** USA 2001-Present

Iraq Wars and Afghanistan Wars would have killed many civilians by collateral damage and intentionality is questionable especially in a fight with the adversary blended in with civilians.  Any takers on this one?

*** Because someone will ask:

Separately, diseases/viruses introduced by Europeans killed 90% of most indigenous peoples in North and South America due to contact with diseases they had never encountered (that Europeans were used to).  This would have been in the millions however it’s before 1776 and mainly under Spanish colonies and French colonies.  There’s evidence of blankets being given to Indians contaminated intentionally with European diseases but largely these deaths were unintentional and little was known about diseases back then.",2025-07-19T00:37:22

I said at the beginning of his second term that he would try to get Putin to negotiate and eventually get pissed off because the Russians are incredibly delusional and resort to giving Ukraine more weapons out of a sense of vengeance towards Putin for making him look bad.

It's hard to get concrete information on exactly which Ukrainian units are deployed where. It would likely require moving elite units from elsewhere on the front to that area and flooding the salient with drones and artillery fire. But Russia is able to contest each of those steps. 

Finding a way to attack and degrade the Russian drone unit would also be very important, but Russia has massive numbers of drones available and no shortage of drone operators either. 

These difficulties are a big reason why Ukraine has shown little to no ability to cut off and destroy major Russian offensive salients in the last year or two. When the Russians push hard in a certain place, they simply have far more resources to throw into the fight and can stomach severe losses.

That said, it’s important to understand *why* some people chose to collaborate with Nazi Germany—not to justify their actions, but to preserve historical truth. Today, we rightly recognise the Nazi regime as one of the greatest evils in history. But in the early years of the war, that wasn’t always obvious to everyone. The full scale of Nazi atrocities only became widely known after the liberation of concentration camps toward the end of the war. Even in Poland—where the worst of these horrors occurred—many people were unaware of what was happening outside major cities, especially in rural areas.

My grandparents and great-grandparents lived in eastern Poland, in a region that changed hands multiple times due to shifting borders under the **Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact**—the secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. They experienced occupation by both regimes, and here’s what they used to tell me:

“When the Germans were in charge, they demanded obedience. You had to follow their orders, but for the most part they let you live in peace. They would come to the farm and take food for their soldiers, but they knew we were a big family with children, so they left enough for us to survive.  
When the Soviets came, they didn’t care. They took everything. They would pillage the farm, steal from our house, and they raped and killed for sport.”

It’s stories like these that help me understand why some people in similar circumstances might have collaborated with the Germans—particularly if it gave them a chance to resist or fight back against the Soviets. That doesn’t make it right. But the moral landscape was far more complex on the ground than it appears in hindsight.

It’s worth remembering that many in the **Baltic states** and some regions of **Ukraine** initially welcomed the arrival of German forces. After years of brutal repression, forced deportations, and political purges under Soviet rule, the Nazis were seen—at least briefly—as potential liberators.

Of course, today the Nazi swastika is a universal symbol of hate and genocide. But back then, to many people caught in the chaos of shifting frontlines and collapsing regimes, it was just another flag—one more invading force among others.",2025-07-15T10:23:39
1m0d7uy,An interesting look across the fence,jesterboyd,271,2025-07-15T09:27:54,LeviMarx,17,"Yeah. It was a common occurance that germans would surrender themselves to the allies towards the end of the war because they knew what would happen if Russians got their hands on them, there would be no trial. 

Like you said, not all Germans or Russians were bad and had their own reasons. Plenty of Russians also ended up as POWs in concentration camps. My grandpa saw Auschwitz in action and his recounts still haunt me. He was transferred to Dauhau and whilst there, he managed to trade a lighter for a spoon with a Russian in order to cut the 'bread' into thin slices so everyone could get a piece alongside water melted from snow to make a dipping 'broth' to make it 'tolerable' 

They were given bread that consisted of saw dust to eat and even resorted to eating the maggots off the bodies. 'There wasn't a single insect alive in that camp that didn't get eaten'. 

After he was liberated by the British, he never saw that Russian soldier again but he kept that spoon and thought of him, wondering if he ever made it home safe after the war.",2025-07-15T12:55:11

Her family were no fans of the Nazis, but unfortunately her father was drafted and sent west (fortunately there). Her stories about the Soviets on their march to Berlin are… horrific does not describe it well enough I’m afraid. At around 13, Soviet soldiers passed on her as she was too skinny but they took her best friend and her friend’s mother away. She says all she remembers was hearing the two gun shots. They made her walk through a burning town on her flight west, if she died oh well. She is lucky she lived and i am lucky I’m here. 

As you said, fuck the Nazis to the end of time, but the truth of history is necessary to keep. The soviets were animals to the people they “liberated”.

To end of a positive note; she is the sweetest old woman i ever met. Tough as nails, and hates despots and dictators",2025-07-15T14:52:58
1m0d7uy,An interesting look across the fence,jesterboyd,271,2025-07-15T09:27:54,Sweet_Lane,30,"People should finally accept the fact that hammer and sickle is the symbol of the regime far more brutal and inhumane than swastika. Soviets not only committed horrible crimes against humanity themselves, they also supported nazi Germany for years, and eventually they instigated the second world war by signing the molotov-ribbentrop pact. The direct outcome was German aggression against Poland which caused allies to declare war on Germany, but Soviet aggression against Poland was not punished and not even discussed for years. 


I also think that violence between Ukrainians and Poles was started by false flag operations by either Germany or Soviets, as the politics of 'divide and conquer' was always the trademark of russians. See the acts of violence in Azerbaijan that led to Armenian-Azerbaijan war and push both countries back for decades (and turned Armenia into the puppetstate of russia, dependent on russian military and support); or acts of violence in  Moldova that led to de facto russian occupation of parts of Moldova and pushed the country back for decades; or acts of violence in Georgia that again lead to the war and russian occupation of parts of Georgia; or violence in Ukraine that lead to war and russian occupation of parts of Ukraine. Once you see the pattern and outcome, you can't be fooled by smoke and mirrors. ",2025-07-15T12:59:52

The Germans would generally leave you alone as long as you didn’t try to impede them. My great grandfather had a flour mill and the Germans would take flour from him but not take everything he had only what they needed. The Russians however would take everything you had and leave nothing without a care in the world.  They would beat and rape women, they would kill for fun knowing there were no consequences. 

At the end of the day there’s no sense in bickering about who did what and what happened to whom. The way I look at it is the Polish and Ukrainian people have moved on and the relationship between the 2 countries has changed concerning what happened in WW2. The German people have changed also, but one thing that has stayed constant is Russian aggression and imperialism. To this day they have not changed they view us the same now as they did then. Just 2 Eastern European countries to be ruled over. Resisting Russian influence, that should be our focus, not bickering about who did what 80 years ago.",2025-07-16T04:51:26

Poles that served in Wehrmacht were for the most part forcibly conscripted from the lands incorporated to the reich. Polish population of those regions were forced to sign Volsklists which made them kind of 3rd class German citizens.

Since 01/2023 I would say the major land battles were:

04/23: 
fall of bakhmut after months of battles 
Major Russian assaut on Vuhledar that fails utterly 

06/23 - 09/23:
Ukrainian counter offensive, with a major focus on Robotino direction. Small Ukrainian gains.

02/24: 
Fall of Avdivka, in Donetsk suburbs. The battle for Avdivka was basically ongoing since 2014. The is important Russia gain that clears the way for a slow advance toward pokrovsk.

05/24:
Russian attack on Vovchansk, on the border. The Russians try to open a new front on the north. Their assault fails with huge loss despite large resources dedicated to the attack. To this days Vovchansk is still under partial Ukrainian control.

Start of the battle for Chasiv Yar. The battle is still ongoing to this day, probably the longest battle of the war 

07/24
Start of Russia assault on New York and Toresk. The battle is still ongoing to this day.

08/24
Ukrainian counter offensive in Sudzha, major advances in only days.

09/24
Fall of Vuhledar after renewed Russian assaut

03/25
Russians take back Ukrainian controlled territories in Sudzha région.

All this time regular Russian assaults on Siversk fail.

Today Russian is slowly creeping on most part of the front line, with focus on Donetsk region. Chasiv Yar and Toresk still hold but barely. Pokrovsk is being slowly encircled.",2025-07-15T09:59:27

What have we learned from over three years of war. Putin has zero regard for life (other than his own), Ukrainian or Russian and is willing to sacrifice as many as necessary to achieve his war aims. Russia still has, despite horrendous losses, overwhelming numbers of manpower, equipment (less that pre-war, but still fairly overwhelming advantage in raw numbers), and, as evidenced by ramped up drone attacks, has managed to scale production of attack drones as never before. 

Finally, we also had a change in the White House that has made all the difference in military support Ukraine has or has not received as well as economic and political pressure exerted or not exerted on Russia, Trump's recent changes notwithstanding because they have yet to play out, so we'll have to wait and see what, if any, impact there will be. There currently is no prospect of a decisive end to war because, from his perspective, Putin has no reason to stop. This was also the reason why Trump's peace overtures amounted to nothing (it was a rude awakening for Trump, he had zero leverage on forcing Putin to stop).",2025-07-15T05:53:59

He was afraid that Russia might go nuclear if defeated. So instead he chose to support Ukraine just enough to not lose, and wait for Russia to get tired and agree to fix their gains.

Ukrainians were denied modern aviation, and without air superiority their counter-offensive of 2023 failed. 

Since then the war was going in meatgrinder mode, with neither side being able to make a decisive breakthrough. Russia is slowly prevailing. They have more bodies to throw, have huge oil income, and even have an ally willing to send soldiers - North Korea.

NATO can end this war decisively anytime. Just lease Ukraine few hundred F-16 with modern missiles. The USA alone have 300 in boneyard, ironically stashed off for a war with the Reds. That would end Russian air dominance, hugely complicate their glide bombing and change the battlefield dynamic completely.

Then some powerful ""countries in the coalition"" urged them ""to wait with the Gripen system"". May 2024.

&gt;""We have been urged by the other countries in the coalition to wait with the Gripen system,"" Defence Minister Pal Jonson told TT. ""This has to do with the fact that the focus is now on introducing the F-16 system,"" Jonson said.

That other country had the clout to stop Sweden, and the audacity to suggest that it knows Ukraine's needs better than Ukraine.

A year passed. F-16s are flying in Ukraine. (the US did not give any, and refused to train more than 12 pilots even though Ukraine had more candidates) Still no Gripens. Ukraine still wants them, had talks on that in Feb 2025. Sweden is still willing to give them. They specifically decided not to cannibalize older airframes when building new jets, in order to keep them ready to be gifted to Ukraine.

Meanwhile Ukraine also integrated Mirages into its airforce, confirming that they do have the capacity for another jet type, and the need for more jets. And this time ""F-16 coalition"" did not care, probably because the US does not have much leverage on France. France does not depend on the US for its security, and Mirages do not use American components.

All that points to that the ""country in the coalition"" which stops Sweden is the US and that ""focus on F-16"" is just an excuse.",2025-07-16T18:10:26

The fact that those values are abhorrent (to us), those beliefs are nonsensical (to us), the motivations are absurd (to us), and the information is low-quality or entirely made up doesn't make Putin irrational.

He acts pretty consistently within that in-a-mirror-darkly framework in which he exists.

""Devastating sanctions, interdiction of the Russian shadow fleet"" 1st already happened, irrelevant and gas needs to keep going so irrelevant sanctions. It will be the same with this US tariff bullshit, just a playtoy (the good one was to put China/Iran on 500% tariff). Russia just gets everything from China/Iran/India at this point. US or EU is irrelevant for them.

""Trump is only at the very beginning of making any serious effort whatsoever"" Which efforts? He is just making business NOW. Weapons and aid all come funded by EU, Patriots come from EU. Nothing is coming from US, its just free money.

In the meanwhile EU is just shinking money all the time and it will have a day were the economy can't handle it anymore. This war would be easily ended by military actions from NATO and put boots in the ground but we all know, it's not going to happen.",2025-07-15T09:19:02

Ukraine has moved passed that idea of seeking a negotiated settlement with a Zombie. 

The current theory of victory is not to seek a defeat of Russia in any traditional way. 

Going so far as recognizing this war may never end.

That smaller Ukraine can not 'defeat' bigger already 1/2 dead Russia. 

The goal is to dismantle the ability to act effectively. 

Russia still has a Black Sea fleet, it just can't do what it was designed to do.

WW3 comes down to 1) does China go for Taiwan and if so 2) does US and allies try to stop it.

Russia is a nuclear risk to Europe, but otherwise they are never going to conventional war with NATO. Russia is more worried about NATO entering the fray than vice versa.

Iran/NK -they are meaningless in the scheme of a bigger war, except maybe Japan/SK worrying about a nuclear attack but that would likely be limited to defensive.

It all comes down to China, Taiwan and if that kicks off how the west responds.

All that said I do feel the west should do everything they can to help Ukraine as its both the right thing to do and sets a precedent against Russian aggression generally.

The war unleashed by the russians is like a progressive cancer,CF_Siveryany,137,2025-07-14T16:54:19,CF_Siveryany,8,"My relatives have repeatedly invited me to visit Mezhova in the Dnipropetrovs'k region, and each time I had more important things to do, and it was quite far from me. But this time I was confronted with a fact: You have to come while the village is still ours. It was quite strange for me to be asked this question. I started looking for train and bus tickets to get there. The next available seats were two weeks away. I told my uncle Ilya that, and they told me that two weeks might be too late. It was strange for me, even though I live in a region partially affected by the fighting. After that, I put everything on hold and bought more expensive bus tickets. When I arrived in this village, I couldn't stop admiring the wide streets and flower gardens near every yard. It was Ukraine, but a different region, and there was a lot of unusual and at the same time ordinary. Of course, I couldn't ignore my uncle Ilya's garden and his harvest. Because of the proximity to the front, I did not take pictures of my uncle's house and his neighbors, but I really wanted to, because they are very beautiful and cozy. I left this town with the best impressions of the beautiful places in our country.



A week later, Russian shells began to attack the village. Uncle Ilya and his family are now preparing to evacuate. Most families have already left with their children. The video shows a car with belongings, so apparently someone was also preparing to evacuate. This blooming town will soon be destroyed like dozens of others. The harvest will remain unharvested....

A single day of activities for mom and child, that include painting, sports, working with psychologists, seaside visits and sightseeing costs around $53.

33 children have already enjoyed their piece of mind by the sea, with attentive caretakers, psychologist, animators and art teachers, who all volunteer to help.

Because the increase is correlated with the immense losses of land sea and air assets from Russian side, We all are very aware that Russia has lost its edge, best men and majority of its most valuable assets. Armor, Aircrafts, Airdefence and the Black sea fleet.

On the other hand we have Ukraine that had so little to begin with, but the survival fighting sprit and steady growth in rearming, modernizing, training and adopting. They now have supplies coming in at a continuous growing volume, and advanced ways of attack, like air strikes with heavy guided munition. The big wheels is turning now, and Putins stupid public war crimes and provocations against the west, has been accelerating things, and made a coalition against him. So the balance is really tipping over and come crashing hard on Russia now.

For me to see, this curve has rising casualties and potential less dead over time as we know of (gap). But the big issue here is covering up the death, by the mass cremation of dead in Crimea, and mass burial. Pictures has been publicized at several occasions, and widow compensation money has not been released. So deaths MUST be higher than expected in this curve.

With the amount of long distance and bunker busting capable weapons coming online now, I cant see this will ever break downwards, until Putin is taken off power and fully pulls back. The Ukrainian grinder has some huge teeth's now, and the KPIs that was discussed recently, about reaching 30.000 monthly casualties on Russia. That should be reachable production numbers from Ukraine soon.

I sad it before and I say it again. Ukraine is backed by the free world, and many Russian south eastern republics want to break free, they see their rare opportunity for freedom. That is both showing support, and connect with new relations and defense partners for the future. Putins is badly supported by war criminals, dictators, murderers, religious fanatics, despots and their minions. Erdogan is now silent, Fucko/Fico is dampened, and Orban is reconsidering his position as well. Everyone knows where this goes from now, everyone sees the Russians being forced to their knees now.  Russian supporters are all like Putin, and only into this for the power, robbing people and stealing ressources. That's why Russia is failing.

He's not using his own money to fund the war, he's using the entire resources of the Russian state, taxation, confiscating private companies and fortunes, nationalizing industries, propping up the major banks from State coffers, and selling Russian bonds. Even if he seizes all the wealth of the rich, much of it is not in liquid assets, so it won't fully fund his war effort. As it stands right now the costs of the war and civilian needs far exceed his income from all these sources. This is well known. Even the Russian state itself acknowledges this fact.

As 3:1 was the ratio for US forces in WW2.

The Russians have nowhere near as good as the battlefield care that US had back then

The Russians are not rotating troops off the zero line, don’t really have medics mixed in with their assault squads, the troops have virtually no medical training or equipment (even their tourniquets are junk), Russian troops are commonly without clean water or proper food, they do very, very little medivac / casevac &amp; with drones removing most hiding spots and the ability to do real time BDA &amp; targeted follow strikes… and then there is the whole assault on crutches / non healed wounds thing. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if the actual ratio is close to 2:1 or even 1:1.


There’s a reason why so many wounded Russian troops with so little hesitation eat a bullet / hug a grenade.  If they had access / prospect of access to medical care, we wouldn’t see so many incidents",2025-07-13T21:24:00

If that's why they're fighting, I think they're going to be disappointed. In the longer term, I think this will lead to Russia getting smaller.

The war is weakening Moscow more than anything else has in decades (save the collapse of the USSR and even then I think there's a debate to be had.)

If I was a separatist from Chechnya, Georgia, Dagestan, Karelia, or Kaliningrad (to name a few) then this would be possibly the most promising time to take action. 

Plus, I believe that China will take advantage of this eventually. Russia/the USSR took land from them during the Century of Humiliation and they've been vocal about undoing all of the things that happened to China in that time. I don't know if they'd necessarily annex land themselves, but would they support a Siberian province in breaking off from Russia in return for generous and exclusive mineral and oil-and-gas rights? If I was in Beijing, my answer would be yes.

If ordinary Russians think this is going to end with a glorious Russia growing ever larger, I don't think they've thought it through.",2025-07-14T07:18:27

Shall I remove or edit my comment? I didn't think it was ""sympathy"" but more a general remark that all life is important. But I can see how it suggests sympathy for those monsters volunteering to fight, rape, torture and kill.

The issue that you'll likely face in the event of trying to re-transliterate this now will be in terms of transliteration of documents you (presumably) already hold.

  
In reality, this shouldn't cause any issues for your daughter other than potentially raising a second glance at anyone looking at it. Once the surname is seen, this is unlikely to be a problem at all. She is free to use a different name in life than is on her documents. as many Ukrainians do.

So if the name is ""Andrew"", they will make the patronimic based on ""Andrew"", not ""Andrii"", or the _transcribed, not translated_ version of it.

In my Ukranian wife's case, with her passport they made a transcription from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet. Her name in both of our languages is pretty much the same (just a very slight difference in pronuntiation with two sounds, and the fact of using a different alphabet, Cyrillic vs Latin). The result of the transcription is _almost_ the same than in my language, but with a repeated letter that is not repeated in my language. Ironically, this similitude makes more trouble than if it was a very different thing. Both versions (when written in Latin) are so close, that most people here tend to ignore the repetition as if it was a typo or something, so she always has to be careful and insist on it whenever she's making any official paperwork, bureaucracy, etc, like residence permit, driving license, contracts, and whatnot. Otherwise she could have some problems or at least, would have to make more paperwork to correct it.

Honestly, I don't think you'll succed with that (I might be wrong). The patronimic is not an equivalent to like an English middle name that you can choose. Although not exactly the same, it would be more similar to a family name: you have the one you have. Maybe it's not impossible to change it (I don't know), but it would be way harder.",2025-07-11T19:55:48

You have a name that is Andrew, that’s a fact. Imagine how many people in like customs office, border guards, other institutions will know your name but assume it’s not your daughter since the name doesn’t match? You will slow down everybody in a queue significantly every time her documents would get a check.

Patronymic is not a second name. It is a rule that institutions obey. In your case, the name you want is different semantically. While you still thinking about some wishes to a patronymic, consider it as a rule, and not as a name you choose. Many more foreigners have the patronymic with more difficult pronunciation. It’s fine. Besides, no one really calls people by their patronymic, you can be friends with someone and not know their patronymic. It’s not a big deal. Yet obeying the rules will make your life 10000% easier. Imagine finding documents to prove she’s your daughter to someone who doesn’t even want to hear you.

Would getting a lawyer involved help at all? It is hard for me to just accept that we can't name our child how we want.

That's a tough one. Your best chance of getting something done is redoing translation of your own name. Your second-best choice is citing the cultural practices of your culture and refuse patronymic altogether or bullshit confidently enough to get something inbetween. The latter may not fly.

&gt; But they insist her patronymic must be my entire first name, with the suffix -ївна.

This is how it works and you can't argue with it really. Nothing in the law says how to form patronymics by the way, it's a language thing. Not all patronymics are -ївна, there are some pattern-breakers.

Arguing with registry officials in general is hard, they are bound by instruction and are difficult to get things done that *are* in a law, but something they are not familiar with in daily practice. It's also kind of a good thing, at least when they are acting in good faith. You don't want creativity in your bureaucracy.

&gt;When my passport is officially translated, it says something like Ендрю. The Ukrainian ""version"" of my name is Андрій. Everyone knows this, it's clear that these are the same names, just in different cultures

That's what you think, but that's not what the law thinks. If your name is Ендрю, you aren't Андрій. Shocking, but also Михайло, Майкл and Міхеіл (everybody's favorite president) are different names.

Yes, registry officials would do Майкловна, Джонівна and Родрігішна without thinking twice.

As unfair as it sounds, you couldn't as adult change your patronymic to something random before 2020 (see amusing ECHR ruling https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/974_960 ). For children before 16 years of age it's just fathers name (if mother is married).

Russian labour force was not affected by the Black Death to the same degree, so peasants remained poor and landless, while nobles held power. So the Tsars were allied with nobility and laws became more autocratic.

&gt;In Russia, the opposition will not stand in opposition. Citizens will not stand up for civic rights. The Russian people suffer from a victim complex: they believe that nothing depends on them, and by them nothing can be changed.

&gt;‘It’s always been so’, they say, signing off on their civic impotence. The economic dislocation of the nineties, the cheerless noughties, and now President Vladimir Putin’s iron rule – with its fake elections, corrupt bureaucracy, monopolization of mass media, political trials and ban on protest – have inculcated a feeling of total helplessness. People do not vote in elections: ‘They’ll choose for us anyway;’ they don’t attend public demonstrations: ‘They’ll be dispersed anyway;’ they don’t fight for their rights: ‘We’re alive, and thank god for that.’

&gt;A 140-million-strong population exists in a somnambulistic state, on the verge of losing the last trace of their survival instinct. They hate the authorities, but have a pathological fear of change. They feel injustice, but cannot tolerate activists. They hate bureaucracy, but submit to total state control over all spheres of life. They are afraid of the police, but support the expansion of police control. **They know they are constantly being deceived, but believe the lies fed to them on television.**

  
She hit the nail on the head about her fellow Russians when she noted:



&gt;All that remains for those ashamed of the present and afraid of the future is pride in the past. **When there’s no reason to love your country, hate your neighbours. If you are unable to improve your life, ruin someone else’s.**



The Russians with their pathological complexes and sordid history consistently remind me of the observation that one must not help someone who refuses to be helped. 

What's left then is only vigorous and decisive defense against such malevolence and sense of butthurt.

When your entire history, starting with the Mongol invasion can be summed up with the phrase ""and then it got worse"", there are only so many times people can be expected to pick themselves back up and try again. Eventually, the only reasonable, rational even, answer is to just stay on the ground and let your abuser go about their business hoping they don't notice you. And when your abuser is literally the central government, there isn't a lot you can do about that short of outright revolt.

Most likely because they were not under the jackboots of the Russians but instead under the European aegis of the Austrians, Hungarians and/or Poles.

Of course, this isn't to say that the Ukrainians on the eastern bank of the Dnipro were / have been irrevocably deranged like the Russians by having been under the Russians' jackboots since at least the 1700s.

I do think that with the benefit of hindsight, Bohdan Khmelnytskyi made a mortal mistake in 1654 by aligning himself with the Russians to save himself and his friends in the lower nobility from the oh-so-evil and oh-so-brutal Catholic Poles.

&gt;If you asked me to characterise the “Russian World” (Russky mir) in one word, I would not hesitate to call it infantilism. This term best describes the current state of Russian society.

&gt;**Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.**

&gt;It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:

&gt;“The Аmеrісаnѕ let the price of oil fall. The Аmеrісаnѕ organised a revolution in Ukraine. Аmеrіса hаtеѕ Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and ІіbеrаІѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brоthеrѕ stole all the money. But Putin is good.”

&gt;There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.

&gt;Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.

&gt;In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.

&gt;The absolute lack of understanding of the value of life is just as infantile.

&gt;It is not acceptable for adults to inflate a frog with a straw, to decapitate a puppy, to pound residential neighbourhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction, or to shoot down passenger jets with surface-to-air missiles while thinking:

&gt;“What difference does it make whether it was a passenger jet or not? The birdie is down, hooray! We did warn them not to fly in our skies!”

&gt;The failure to grasp the value of life, including one’s own, is perhaps the main characteristics of an infantile person. In addition to the lack of any logical thinking.

&gt;That is a world where causal links are broken, where actions and consequences are not related in any manner, and where throwing eggs from the window and a cuff on the ear are two totally unrelated developments — just like the occupation of a part of a neighbouring country, sanctions, and the collapse of oil prices.

Type in ""infantilism Russia Babchenko"". For some reason posts with a link to the article are routinely deleted even though the domain is not a Russian one.

Another good article on how crucial brutality is to the Russians and their self-regard comes from [an interview with various counterintelligence officers from the Baltic states](https://vsquare.org/baltic-counterintelligence-officers-russia-cruelty-war-history/) who started their careers in the KGB when the Russians were occupying their countries.

Lastly, there's a translated interview with Dmitry Titkov, a former associate of Navalny's, available on various Reddit posts. It was done with a Polish newspaper in February 2022, and he goes on to identify that a key element in Russian identity is the imperialistic self-entitlement to the destiny of **non**\-Russians.

Here's a snippet

&gt;*When the war broke out, in Stockholm, where I am seeking asylum, Navalny's supporters decided to support Ukraine and march in front of the Russian embassy. There was a discussion whether to go there with a Russian flag. This proves that even if someone is an opponent of Putin, they still don't fully realise that it's not just about Putin. Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians, Chechens and Georgians understand me very well. In Russia, all the people are either asleep and only see what is in front of their noses and believe Putin's propaganda, or they are against Putin - but still remain within the imperial framework. When the question arises whether to trust Russians or not - I say: trust only those who no longer associate themselves with Russia, who want to learn other languages, who understand that Russia must fall apart, that it must cease to exist as an empire.*

&gt;*I was born and raised in the Arkhangelsk region and I believe that there could be an Arkhangelsk Republic without any Moscow, culturally and economically integrated with Scandinavia. The Caucasus could also exist separately - and so on.*

&gt;*Those who keep saying 'Russia will be happy', 'Russia will be free' - have not understood anything. Russia should no longer exist.*

Google ""Titkov Russians have no sympathy"" to find the whole article. It's quite enlightening and refreshing since Titkov is one of the very few Russians out there who identifies that his compatriots and their foundational imperialism have been the problems, and not whatever excuse is used to blame non-Russians for whatever ails Russians. He didn't even spare himself since his interview includes how that ingrained Russian imperialism blinded him initially to how his non-Russian peers felt about his ethnic background.",2025-07-11T15:39:30

The only reasons I can take seriously a Russian like Titkov more than the vast majority of Russians are his honesty in calling out his people's dysfunction and conviction that the Ukrainians as the obvious victims need external support much more than the Russians.

Here are the concluding parts of the interview

&gt;*Now I work as a dishwasher in a hotel in northern Sweden. I rode the train with two girls who escaped from Kharkiv before the Russian bombings. They are closer to me than any of the Russians, and when I listened to them, I was ready to go and kill Russian soldiers myself. Although I might have turned out to be an idiot like them in 1994 when there was a war in Chechnya and I miraculously missed it. Russia is a curse that has afflicted many nations, and we still can't get rid of it, even after the collapse of the USSR.*

&gt;*I will not go fight in this war on the Ukrainian side simply because I will not be of much use there. So if you want to help someone - help the Ukrainians, they deserve it.* ***And the Russians have to go on their own until the end of the road they created themselves. And if they experience an epiphany, they will understand why they are not loved.***",2025-07-11T16:21:48

Russia is a cancer of the world.

It's worse than that.

The Russians' ancestors missed out on the Reformation, Renaissance, Age of Exploration, Counter-Reformation and Age of Enlightenment.

Their ""Age of Exploration"" was instead [a relentless and brutal overland colonialist march eastward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_Russia#Table_of_changes) beyond the Urals so as to resurrect a transcontinental realm in the image of the МоngоІ Еmpire.

Their ""Age of Enlightenment"" was a poor imitation of what Europeans experienced with Peter I and Catherine II implementing half-аѕѕеd reforms that benefited only the thin upper crust of the Russians' **caste system** for a society all the while *still* expanding Russia's landmass in the ""fine"" tradition of Ivan the Terrible and their spirit animals from the Gоldеn Ноrdе.

No, sanctions need to be a team effort with congress to make sure it happens. Trump cannot be trusted to hold firm against his buddy, putin. TACO will chicken out with Russia.

FTFY

See the [Circassian Genocide](https://ecrgroup.eu/event/their_only_crime_was_not_being_russian_the_circassian_genocide) (1863-1878), [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire) (1800s), [Sack of Baturyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Baturyn#Course_of_the_sack) (1708), [conquest / colonization of Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_conquest_of_Siberia) (1580 - 1778) etc.

What is infuriating and disturbingly striking about the Russians as a whole is their defiant and obnoxious moral cowardice in facing up to *any* past crimes on **non**\-Russians. If you were to ask a random Russian in the 21st century about potential redress or at least efforts to prevent recurrence, you'd most likely be met with sullen silence or juvenile whataboutery.

As if the Russians were to get a pass for atrocities because of atrocities committed by long-dead ancestors of modern-day Americans, Britons, Frenchmen, Germans, Iranians, Italians, Japanese, Моngоlіаnѕ, Portuguese, Serbs, Spaniards or Turks.

The Russians' ""logic"" is as destructive, infantile and sociopathic as if I were to justify murdеrіng my neighbor right now because OJ Simpson got away with it or something like that.",2025-07-11T18:13:38

It's probably because they are not at the top of the caste system that has defined Russian society.

On the upper levels of the caste system are ethnic Russians with the richest and suitably сuсkеd and corrupted ones being at the very top. Furthermore, there's a socially-acceptable distinction in which an ethnic Russian from Moscow or St. Petersburg has more prestige than an ethnic Russian from elsewhere to say nothing about any **non**\-Russian regardless of birthplace. Russian itself lexicalizes this distinction by using the terms *Русские* (Russkiye) to mean ethnic Russians and *Россияне* (Rossiyane) to refer to all citizens of Russia. In contrast, we in English use ""Russian(s)"" for both senses.

Being an ethnic minority in Russia elicits varying amounts of condescension, sometimes worsened or abetted by your hometown. On a somewhat related note, Volga Tatars are rather like a notably cynical variant of the ""model minority"" in Russia because of how their distinctiveness and relative demographic and socioeconomic success are used to play up ethnic Russians' ""tolerance"" all while still being tools of Russian imperialism. For example, after the Russians had goose-stepped their way into Crimea in 2014, [delegations of Volga Tatars went to Crimea to legitimize the Russians' re-annexation by spouting buІІѕhіt to the Crimean Tatars](https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-is-trying-to-weaken-crimean-tatar-resistance-with-the-help-of-tatarstan/) of how things wouldn't be *that* bad in Crimea under renewed Russian occupation.

Note that Crimean Tatars and Volga Tatars are clearly related as Turkic people but their languages differ from each other roughly as much as Dutch does from Norwegian.",2025-07-11T21:13:14

RusHydro CEO Informs Putin of Company's Dire Financial Situation  
... Putin held a meeting with Viktor Khmarin, CEO of the energy company RusHydro ... .  
Mr. Khmarin spoke about the company's difficult financial situation.  
“The financial situation is quite difficult, because prices for everything are rising,” said Viktor Khmarin   
“And, accordingly, the company is highly indebted.”  
As Viktor Khmarin recalled, in 2024, RusHydro's revenue amounted to 650 billion rubles,  
EBITDA - 150 billion rubles. In March, the company also reported that the net loss amounted to 61.16 billion rubles.  
...""  
RusHydro, energy what are they doing? In Russia chemical plants also make MLRS ...  
They own hydroelectric power plants.  
If you can't maintain a street, you have potholes. A hydro? What should ever happen?  
Cracks in the dam and a manager who decides that they want to work on full power because of the revenue ...  
Does RusHydro have experience?  
Well ... yess.

""On 17 August 2009, a turbine ... failed catastrophically, killing 75 people and severely damaging the plant.  
The turbine hall was flooded, and a section of its roof collapsed.  
All but one of the ten turbines in the hall were destroyed or damaged. The entire power output of the plant, totalling 6,400  megawatts, was lost, leading to widespread power outages in the area. ...""

“Money doesn't come from tress” - okay, so USA spends currently about a $ trillion on the military. The main reason for that huge expense is to be able to fight two major wars at the same time, and the only possible two wars are against Russia and China (since Mexico certainly isn’t going to invade any time soon)

Well, the war with Russia is happening RIGHT NOW. And we can win it, without a single US soldier dying. It just takes sending (let’s say) half the current military budget to Ukraine - $500B would do the job (even if nobody else helped). Yes that would mean a lot of cuts to existing military programs. You know what? It doesn’t matter - in a world in which Russia is thoroughly crushed, the US can permanently reduce its military in half and save $500B per year forever. Purely from a money perspective that’s the deal of the century

Secondly, the US already has insane stockpiles of gear. That wouldn’t be cash coming out of the budget, it’s a sunk cost, actually that gear takes a lot of money every year to store, and would take money to scrap. Sending it to Ukraine would be CHEAPER than scrapping it. For example US has literally thousands of ATACMS in storage which are expired, and would cost money to dispose of safely.

“equivalent to 400B USD western tech is a big stretch” - I’m not sure why you’d say that. Their artillery shells are around 100,000 rubles; western ones are around $4000.  So yeah, while the cash exchange rate is 100 rubles = 1 dollar, the exchange rate based on gear is closer to 25 rubles = 1 dollar. It’s the same for everything else - drones, missiles, etc

Overwhelming Russia with weapons CAN be done but would indeed take way more than $400B/year in US dollar terms. Anything less is NOT ENOUGH, that’s my whole point.

So it doesn't matter if Trump's comments this week are ""caustic"" or ""ballistic"" or ""explosive"" or anything else at all.  They are just comments and comments don't matter.

What matters is what the United States does.  And currently, it is withholding authorized aid for Ukraine, and refusing to authorize more.

None of these things warrant being called ""immediate action.""

Look I just want people to understand.  When a talking head says on an electronic screen, ""They are now getting more aid,"" *that does not mean diddly squat*.

That is not immediate action.  That is just words.

And when some bureaucratic PR person says, ""Our agency confirms that more aid will now be gotten,"" *that too does not mean diddly squat*.

That is also not immediate action, it is still just words.

None of those things are action.

The problem though, Putin comes from the soviet era, where showing any weakness, ever, means you won't be respected, and could lose that power. Trump, a business man, thinks leverage is in the negotiation, where he's used to intimidating people with his shallow world salad and financial bravado. Putin, by nature, cannot agree to or even appear to even consider negotiating with Trump, or he will lose all respect, and become a target. They're both con men, but Putin has actually given out orders to have people killed in order to show everyone else that he isn't to be crossed, while Trump has just continuously tried to cozy up to Putin in the hopes that Putin will show him ""American"" respect.

He simply said what experts were saying the whole time.

If ukrainian soldiers get trained to operate the taurus (for example the several navigation systems) without any involvment of german soldiers for a mission it's pretty clear that germany wouldn't be considered a party in that sense.

The former chancellor scholz build his arguments around this. That it would need german soldiers to handle the navigation. Means involvement within a mission. Of course that was an excuse for his decision making. If a german soldier can learn it an ukrainian soldier can do so as well.

Scholz comments are the only reason this topic about taurus and german involvment exists.",2025-07-09T22:39:37

Russia and Ukraine are innovating and building capacities. That much is clear. And Russia is a repressive country, with no free press. Therefore, it’s genuinely hard to track what’s going on, and it’s hard to assess the real impact of various strikes. How many production facilities do they really have? How many parts are stockpiled? What’s really the state of the Russian equipment in open-air storage?

And how far is Russias economy from tanking? That again depends on various factors like the ability to attract immigrants in order to replace working-age people killed in the war.

Literally *everything*. I’m convinced—and I present as evidence the last 15 years of words that have come out of his mouth—that’s he’s unable to form a sentence without at least one lie in it.

He just *says* things, and his sycophants believe them without question; doesn’t matter if they contradict things he said the day before, or if there’s a mountain of evidence to the contrary; he is their ultimate authority, and *their* reality bends to his words. I don’t believe there’s anything he could say that’s too outlandish for his followers to believe.

He could say the Moon is made of cheese, and these fucking morons would complain that the “Deep State” is artificially inflating cheese prices by hiding all the Moon cheese from us because… well, they won’t have an answer for *why* anyone would do that; it’s just what the “evil Deep State” *does*. If he were to come out as a flat-Earther tomorrow, we’d have his supporters storming NASA and demanding that they tell us why they’re lying about the shape of the Earth.

So I’m not surprised that the Russian Puppet-in-Chief is claiming he’s “helping a lot” when, in fact, his administration has consistently stopped or stalled assistance to Ukraine, undermined their security, and misrepresented the facts of this war since day one. He’s a lying motherfucker—as are all the little liars who work for him—and there isn’t a single word that comes out of his fat, lying mouth that can be trusted.",2025-07-07T14:51:18

russia can almost afford to fight in Ukraine against Ukraine, but they'd be utterly stretched if even just Poland joined in with boots on the ground right now. Shit any country could do that right now quite legally, because russia didn't even bother to formally declare war.


And if this happened? russia would capitulate AGAIN just as it has after EVERY so called 'escalation' in support of Ukraine that has occurred.


Every red line they've reinvented when it was crossed, every thou shalt not pass they've collapsed over.


So, what do you imagine? scary nukes and the well trained, well funded, professional red army sweeping the globe? China jumping in to help russia and completely fucking its own economy? Lol.


russia does anything with nukes and they are a glass car park in an hour and they know it - IF any of those nukes even still work. The BEST they could muster in a perfect conditions test was to have them blow up on launch.


No, what the countries around Ukraine want to do right now is make soothing noises, send a bit of aid, and hope Ukraine will bleed russia dry and solve their problem. Pretty much the opposite of the Budapest Memorandums intention.",2025-07-06T20:05:46

дякую (diakuiu) - thanks :)

Since it’s July, here’s how I’d plan things out based on your goals:

Landscapes, lakes, and mountain vibes in Ukraine (without snow)

If you want to enjoy nature without everything being snow-covered, summer to early autumn (July–October) is perfect. Right now (July), everything is super green and blooming, and the Carpathians are honestly magical.

Places I’d recommend:

* Synevyr Lake - just beautiful like in a fairytale 
* Bakota – I've done stand-up paddle boarding there. amaziiiing

Closer to Kyiv:

* Trukhaniv Island 
* Zhukiv Island

You can find more ideas like this on [visitkyiv.com](https://visitkyiv.com) — it's a non-commercial guide with local tips, walking routes, and cafés we've visited ourselves.

❄️ But what about snow and winter stuff?

If you want to ski, ice skate on lakes, and catch that true winter fairytale vibe, plan for January or February in Western Ukraine. That’s when snow is reliable and lakes may freeze over (just check local ice safety updates, of course). In Ukraine, Bukovel is the main ski resort. A bit crowded and expensive, but it works well. For a more local feel, places like Slavske or Dragobrat are fun and cheaper (I prefer Slavske and Dragobrat)

Ukrainian is super appreciated — even a few words like “Pryvit” (hi) or “Diakuiu” (thank you) go a long way.

Hope this helps you plan! And if you pass through Kyiv, we have walking routes and favorite cafés mapped out on [visitkyiv.com](https://visitkyiv.com) in case you want to explore the city a bit too. Safe and responsible travels!

Relatives and  friends of prisoners of war and missing soldiers, as well as regular people, gathered at Independence Square in central Kyiv. 

Halyna joined the rally to support her husband. He served in the Pokrovsk direction and has been considered missing since December 9, 2024. As of now, she has no further information.

“The last time I spoke with my husband was the evening of December 6, 2024. He told me they were going out on a mission — maybe for 10 days, maybe longer — and that he wouldn’t have any connection. He said he’d call me himself. We said goodbye, and he told me, ‘As long as you pray for me, I have wings on my back. I’m not cold,’” 

Nataliia is waiting for her son Vladyslav, who served in the 71st Brigade and is considered missing in action.

“There is absolutely no information about him. He disappeared in Kurakhove while serving with the 71st. My dear son, we are all waiting for you — your mother, grandmother, brother. Come back, son, I can’t live without you. I need you,” she said.

Veronika’s husband disappeared seven months ago. Officially, he is listed as missing in action, but she believes he is in captivity.

“The command says he’s missing. He’s not listed among the prisoners or the dead. But we have information that he was taken captive. There’s a video showing 16 soldiers surrendering, two of them badly wounded. According to his comrades, my husband was gravely injured. We think that he’s the one being carried in that video,” Veronika shared.

Inna’s father served in the 44th Mechanized Brigade and is also considered missing.

“The brigade hasn’t provided any official information. From the first day he went missing, russian soldiers have been contacting us with contradictory stories, mostly saying he died. But there’s no photo or video proof,” she said.",2025-07-05T20:37:33

“I want to say hi to him and tell him I miss him very much. I hope he comes back from the war soon,” the little girl said.

Iryna, the head of the Berehyni of the 77th Brigade group, said that the group now includes more than 60 military units.

“We are once again here to remind everyone about the missing soldiers of the 77th Brigade. Our guys defended Soledar and Bakhmut. Since September 2023, there’s been almost no information — no POWs, no confirmed fallen. Most are listed as ‘missing.’ We ask the government and all relevant institutions to do everything possible to find our loved ones. The same goes for 2024 — from January through October, almost no new information has been received,” Iryna said.

Olena is waiting for her fiancé, who fought with the 44th Brigade and went missing in September 2024 in the village of Andriivka, Luhansk region.

At Independence Square, families created a symbolic installation — on a map of Ukraine, they placed torn heart-shaped stickers with the names of missing defenders.

The families of POWs and the missing say they will continue to rally until every single one of them returns home.

As of February 2025, nearly 63,000 civilians and soldiers are officially listed as missing under special circumstances. About 40% of those returned from captivity had previously been considered missing in action.

“If you are not currently in Ukraine, we strongly recommend against all travel to Ukraine by U.S. citizen males aged 18 to 60 who also have Ukrainian citizenship or a claim to Ukrainian citizenship and who do not wish to stay in Ukraine indefinitely. There is an extremely high risk you will not be allowed to depart, even with a U.S. passport.”

Main issue is “or a claim to Ukrainian citizenship” because he clearly does. Of course, is it possible some record isn’t in the system? Sure maybe. But you’re in for a world of f*cks if you are a male adult they find out your parent was a Ukrainian citizen. Not worth the risk.

I knew the nearest bomb shelter was five minutes away but had no idea if it was open or what the situation outside was. So…. I mean I Googled what to do and got the two wall and under a staircase advice :-) 

Ukraine is beautiful and I’d love to visit again and if I did so I think I’d book somewhere with a shelter! Again, silly really because when I was in Madagascar I booked a hotel because I was smart enough to realize I might need support whilst there and somehow forgot that lesson in Ukraine!

Maybe if you’re a computer programmer, but without a college degree and any random job. I think you’re in for a rude awakening having lived your entire life in the US. I’m not saying it’s “bad” I have a lot of friends there, I love visiting there - but to set your life up there in your situation is going to be much tougher than you are giving it credit for. 

Family support structure is everything when you don’t make much money an rely on your support network in all kinds of ways because you don’t have the money to solve everything. 

Not to mention a lot of things still operate where who you know to get things done sometimes matters greatly. Do you want the official document like today/tomorrow, or whenever they get around to it after you’ve had to go back 5 times? You don’t have that network.

If a drone was hovering up so high in the sky that you couldn't see it, would you even know if it was there?  Drones can easily swoop down on people, and you could be in danger.

People use to tell me the statistics of dying in war especially for a medic and they were pretty bad, but I don't know the statistics for Ukraine.

At 20, you should be thinking about getting an education so that you can get a good job or career.  If not, you should be taking up a trade.

What is your five-year plan?  Do you have a plan for your life?

Who is going to pay your way at 20?  You need money, you need reserve funds, you need to be able to pay rent, and I don't know what it costs to go to school overseas.  I don't know what it costs to learn a trade in Ukraine.  If you don't have resources, are you willing to sit on the floor?  And if you don't like it and want to leave, how would you get back home?  You need money for a bus and plane ticket home.

I can't really see what will happen because they are at war.  I can't advise you of a situation that you and I don't fully understand.

My advice is you use the internet to teach people in Ukraine English and maybe someone there can return the favor and teach you Ukranian.

Ivano-Frankivsk is a beautiful city with a strong sense of community. There is a place called Promprylad, it's something like a hub for coworking, dance classes, local cafes, and cultural events. [https://www.instagram.com/promprylad/](https://www.instagram.com/promprylad/) It resembles a mini version of Lviv, but has its own very warm and creative energy.

If you don't speak Ukrainian very well yet, don't worry. People are usually very open, especially if you show that you are trying. In smaller towns and villages, English is less common, but Google Translate or ChatGPT will help you get by. 

I'm from Kyiv, and I understand what it's like to miss a place that feels like home, even if you've never lived there. But I wouldn't rush into things like citizenship or permanent residency. If you have the opportunity to come for 3-6 months (depending on your visa/residence status), it can be a great way to try it out, to live here, explore, meet people, and see if this place is right for you.

Also, in case you ever find yourself in Kyiv, a few friends and I run a small non-commercial project called [visitkyiv.com](http://visitkyiv.com)  It is a local guide created by people who love and live (or have lived) in Kyiv, with personal itineraries, places we trust, and thoughts on how the city feels during the war. We will be happy if you visit us and share your thoughts

Any persons born on the historical territory of Ukraine and residing there as of 1991 are automatically considered citizens. The borders changed quite a bit in 100 years and they needed to keep it simple as to not go any more insane than it already is. Simply leaving before independence or thereabouts is not going to hold water for such serious issues. 

I would highly advise to not even consider this course of action given the risk involved. You do what you want, but at 20 years old and with little more than a longing for your familial home (which I understand and can relate to), this can become a nightmare scenario where you are trapped very easily and quickly. Even the US Embassy publicly said they cannot help in this scenario as Ukrainian law applies and they have no jurisdiction in Ukraine for even a dual citizen. 

At the very least, go talk to a Ukrainian immigration lawyer, and the Ukrainian consulate near you. Don’t go into this situation with a Reddit question and a bag of assumptions.

1lsezyl,Moving to Ukraine,Anatoliy0540,176,2025-07-05T17:18:52,Professional-Link887,0,"I see you asked this question in another forum, and received similar, solid advice that yes, by law he is a Ukrainian citizen and as a male of 25 can be detained and not allowed to leave the country. That’s law, and I have known countless other stories of people being trapped. 

Sure, sometimes people get lucky. But to call someone an idiot because they’re telling you to exercise caution and not needlessly take such a risk is ridiculous. Going to Ukraine to attend a family funeral as it appears your husband did is also a valid reason. Not to go waltz away and do nothing. 

Ask yourself another question. If the law were applied (thankfully it wasn’t and he was able to attend the funeral of his father and return without trouble), what would you have to LOSE? 

A job, financial ruin, trapped in a country at war (I live here so yes I know how it is), with the real possibility of conscription? Think about this. The only responsible thing to tell a young man is…at the very least, go to the official authorities and make damn sure you Cover Your @ss. We are not deciding where to go on vacation or which restaurant to eat at. This is betting your freedom of movement and life path, potentially your life itself too. 

You ask for advice, get it according to the law and current realities, and insult people for it. Nice going.

May you have a deserving reward for such hubris.",2025-07-07T04:34:26

Straight from the Canadian Embassy official communication to dual citizens, or those who are children and could be considered dual citizens because their parents were born in modern day Ukraine and thus considered citizens: 

“Dual citizenship
Dual citizenship is not legally recognized in Ukraine.

If local authorities consider you a citizen of Ukraine, they may refuse to grant you access to Canadian consular services. This will prevent us from providing you with those services.

You may be considered a citizen of Ukraine if you were born in Ukraine or if one or both of your parents are Ukrainian citizens.

Due to the ongoing Russian military invasion, males between 18 and 60 years of age holding Ukrainian citizenship are prohibited from leaving the country.”

In this video, cultural manager and veteran Yurii Vovkohon reflects on the emotional imprint war leaves behind, how it’s reshaping Ukrainian culture, and why these subtle transformations may define Ukraine for decades to come.

Now, we turn to you—the international community and supporters of Ukraine—to help us continue producing vital stories that not only support Ukraine’s fight against invasion but also remind the world of the value of freedom.

This observation reminds me of what another Russian, Аrkаdiу Ваbсhеnkо, described as his people's ingrained **infantilism**.



&gt;If you asked me to characterise the “Russian World” (Russky mir) in one word, I would not hesitate to call it infantilism. This term best describes the current state of Russian society.

&gt;**Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.**

&gt;It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:

&gt;“The Аmеrісаnѕ let the price of oil fall. The Аmеrісаnѕ organised a revolution in Ukraine. Аmеrіса hаtеѕ Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and ІіbеrаІѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brоthеrѕ stole all the money. But Putin is good.”

&gt;There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.

&gt;Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.

&gt;In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.

&gt;The absolute lack of understanding of the value of life is just as infantile.

&gt;It is not acceptable for adults to inflate a frog with a straw, to decapitate a puppy, to pound residential neighbourhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction, or to shoot down passenger jets with surface-to-air missiles while thinking:

&gt;“What difference does it make whether it was a passenger jet or not? The birdie is down, hooray! We did warn them not to fly in our skies!”

&gt;The failure to grasp the value of life, including one’s own, is perhaps the main characteristics of an infantile person. In addition to the lack of any logical thinking.

&gt;That is a world where causal links are broken, where actions and consequences are not related in any manner, and where throwing eggs from the window and a cuff on the ear are two totally unrelated developments — just like the occupation of a part of a neighbouring country, sanctions, and the collapse of oil prices.

The Russians are practically irredeemable until they prove otherwise. That is something that has happened in *vanishingly few instances* out of a pool of the more than 140 million direct descendants of the Golden Horde's staunchest ~~collaborators~~ bootlickers.

It's a sucker's game to give the benefit of the doubt to the Russians when they have taken it as a national characteristic to upend, invalidate, or even destroy, the norms of non-Russians and the rest of the civilized world.",2025-07-03T21:21:21

The problem with framing it this way is that by the time the oh-so-oppressed and oh-so-victimized Russian people ever get their ѕhіt together, the Ukrainians may well be like the Kurds. That is to say, a nation in the tens of millions who will be *without* a sovereign homeland.

This outcome is part of what more than enough Russians have wanted *all along* in line with their supremacist complex as [""first among equals"" within East Slavdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Russian_nation). To so many Russians, even self-proclaimed ""liberal"" and ""Westernized"" ones, the Ukrainians are ultimately nothing but cut-rate Russians (i.e. ""Little Russians"") who must be under the filthy jackboots of the ""Great Russians"" hailing from the swamps along the Moskva river.

It's more than high time to for us in the civilized world to stop handing out infinite second chances to the Russians to get their shit together and actually help **non**\-Russians, like the Ukrainians, resist decisively yet another [bloody episode of Russian-authored genocide which dates to the 1720s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification_of_Ukraine#Russian_Empire).",2025-07-03T17:57:37

The Russians **choked**.

It's striking how other nations which revolted against tyrants did not retain the widespread cruelty and depraved urge that underpins a centuries-old lust for a jihad-like imperialism.

There's a reason that the Russians have coped with their glaring civic ineptitude with the dark joke of ""and then it got worse"".

Just because some incarnation of a Russian empire collapsed doesn't mean that the fundamental leadership principles for that empire ever changed. In this case, the Russians have come to define themselves as a nation that *needs* autocracy/absolute monarchy, or even totalitarianism, for its own good.

In contrast, democracy or even genuinely representative multi-party government is dangerously chaotic and ""un-Russian"". This is a big reason how Russian dissidents repeatedly go *nowhere* because so many of their ethnic kin regularly chicken out or lose their ѕhіt once they start to realize that they need to take responsibility for themselves and their choices, and learn to trust each other, never mind foreigners, to make any societal progress.

Instead, their unholy hybrid society of a caste system with an extractive economy is functionally the same as when generation after generation of their ancestors chose to be the most loyal *bitсhеѕ* of the Khan of the Golden Horde.",2025-07-03T21:36:28

With that backdrop of course we're not interested in being dependent on the US anymore. We need European arms capabilities built in European factories based on European designs, that can operate independently of American assistance.

1lqqfp1,Ukrainian educational system,No-Recording117,42,2025-07-03T14:04:31,MetalDoktor,7,"To expand on this - Ukraine being ""The Borderland"" represents a lot of cultures. The country is a melting pot of cytures and ideas. Not only Ukrainians and Russians, but also Tatars, Turks, Caucasians, Roma, Poles, Lithuanians, Moldovan, and more (including enclave or two of German villages that survived up to 1949s). And Ukraine being a good land invites more immigrants to work the land.
So when you have these nations that are full of diverse cultures and ideas, those ideas and cultures mix and promote innovations - as new ideas and world views expand on each other. Ancient Rome did this through conquest, HRE,  Islamic and Byzantine empires did this through Religios influence, USA did this though welcoming immigrants (and a lot of people fleeing europe in 30s and operation paperclip in 40s).",2025-07-03T16:49:01

Surprisingly, kindergarten has been absolutely useless for our children. You have to teach them yourself have to read/write and maths. Complete opposite to the Netherlands, where I am from. Then at age 6, the hammer hits you right in the face when school expects your kid to read/write and know at least some maths. Of course, it's ""alright"" if your kid doesn't but there is a somewhat firm recommendation for the parents to fix this before going to school.

Yes, school starts at age 6!

In my opinion, the Ukrainian school system and kindergarten are extremely outdated. Even (NUS) the new Ukrainian system is not that great. Our son is in the intellect group so we knew it would be lots of homework and parent tutoring but I didn't expect him to be finished at 12 every day from school... Basically it's impossible to work and have kids because of this. After school hours daycare is only if both parents officially work..

2022 - government throws money at everything that has “weapon system” written on it, we get lots of foreign stuff and lots of broken deals with “international partners”
2023 - government throws money at everything that has “local weapons manufacturer” on it and as a result we saw a wave of innovations and corruption cases. 

We are now at a point in time where the zoo of systems being used at the frontline is so diverse it is a challenge to ensure that everyone’s training is up to par and they are all maintained properly.

Russians instead focus on a smaller number of platforms (Shakhed, Lancet, etc) that, while lacking in some departments, are simple to mass produce and train operators for. 

So, while your European mind is asking the question about Ukrainian education system, you need to accept that most of our advances are done not thanks to the government (education, financing etc.) but despite it. 

So my answer to you is this. To learn from Ukrainians, accept that you are on your own and besides you no one is going to help, put your back against the wall and start working.",2025-07-03T17:26:56

As of March 2025, Ukraine’s mine-affected land spans an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts.

Clearing landmines and unexploded ordnance is essential to preventing civilian casualties and enabling the safe use of land and infrastructure, fostering the country's recovery and future development.

Demining in Ukraine is primarily carried out by the State Emergency Service and the Armed Forces, with both international and domestic non-governmental organizations contributing to the effort.

The world's largest demining non-governmental organization, the HALO Trust, has operated in Ukraine since 2015 and scaled up its efforts after the full-scale invasion began.

The HALO Trust has cleared nearly 7.9 million square meters of land and located over 41,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance since Feb. 24, 2022.

The organization has grown from a small team of 400 in Kramatorsk, a front-line city in Donetsk Oblast, to a workforce of 1,500 people operating in eight regions across Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent spoke with James Cowan, the CEO of HALO Trust, about the organization's ongoing effort to rid Ukraine of landmines, his assessment of how long it might take, and what new technology could revolutionize the process.",2025-07-02T14:18:23

(Russia-Ukraine war),"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.",chrisdh79,1825,2025-07-02T10:52:49,chrisdh79,103,"From the article: The United States' reported decision to suspend some arms deliveries to Ukraine could help bring Russia's war in Ukraine to an end, the Kremlin said on July 2, according to Russian state-controlled media.

""The fewer weapons that are supplied to Ukraine, the closer the end of the... (Russia-Ukraine war),"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

Peskov's comments came after Politico reported that the U.S. Defense Department has paused shipments of key air defense and precision munitions to Ukraine over concerns about declining U.S. stockpiles.

Among the withheld items are Patriot air defense missiles, precision artillery rounds, Hellfire missiles, and other munitions used by Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires John Ginkel on July 2 to voice concern over the reported pause in weapons shipments.

Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa warned during the meeting that ""any delay or hesitation in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities will only encourage Russia to continue war and terror, rather than pursue peace.""

According to Politico, Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby ordered the halt in June following a review of U.S. ammunition levels. The White House confirmed the decision, saying it was part of a broader reassessment of American military aid to foreign partners.

""(The decision) was made to put America's interests first following a DOD review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement.

The move comes as Ukraine faces intensifying Russian attacks. In June, Russia launched a record 5,337 Shahed-type attack drones at Ukrainian targets, the highest monthly total since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The U.S. has not approved any new military aid packages after U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also signaled that future U.S. defense budgets will reduce the scale of assistance to Ukraine.",2025-07-02T10:54:05

The new production facility in Japan will have a capacity of about 50 patriot pac 3 mse within two years.  That facility should be up and running but, a subcontractor for “guidance systems” is behind schedule in attaining materials and components.  The Japanese MHI facility is two years behind and recently started “low rate initial production”.  The U.S. Navy is looking to employing patriot aboard ship to reduce cost and limited availability of SM-3 and SM-6 missiles.
NATO analyst recognizes production challenges (France samp-t and aster missiles are hopelessly expensive and complex to produce in any meaningful numbers).

FTFY

The vile Russian project to enslave, if not exterminate, Ukrainians not only predates the oligarchs but it has been a *team effort* from top to bottom no matter how much Russophiles and self-proclaimed ""liberal"" and ""Westernized"" Russians flap their gums, wave their hands, and stamp their feet that it's still **only** the fault of one V. V. Putin.

Behold the ""apolitical"" and ""oppressed"" Russians who are *akshually* victims on the same level (!) as the Ukrainians.

The reality is that the Russian people have utterly made themselves unworthy of getting a pass from the Ukrainians and the rest of the civilized world. Why would the Russians get such a pass in light of this latest attempt at [a ""Final Solution"" for a ""question"" that has been centuries in the making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification_of_Ukraine#Russian_Empire) starting from when their ""enlightened"" despot ~~Peter the Great~~ Peter I was squatting on the throne more than 300 years ago?

That said.

That said. The European NATO needs Ukraine just as much if not more than Ukranians need NATO. I want peace, true peace for you - similarly to how we could breathe easier in the Baltics for at least a few years after 2004 accession into it. And being in NATO could hopefully bring you closer to that. But as it stands, Ukranian defence and strategic innovation, plus modern warfare experience is I'd think unmatched by any NATO country. I think having you in NATO would only end up making the entire continent safer for it. What we do have is bigger economies and more modern equipment we should be supporting you with. If we get into gear with sanctions, military and other kind of support, help you *win* this and pave the way towards NATO accession - the entire Europe will be safer for it.

We need each other I suppose my point is. So yes, Ukraine in EU and NATO. ",2025-07-02T01:15:43

It's a characteristic aspect of wars waged by dictatorships that they will keep going full tilt, all gas no brakes, until they suddenly collapse completely. There's no willingness or ability to compromise or accept failure, so they tend to keep throwing everything they have at their opponent until they run out completely. At which point the whole regime crumbles in total defeat, seemingly out of the blue. 

Where a sane leader would go ""We better pull back and sue for peace now, while we still have enough of a reserve force to defend against other threats"", dictators detached from reality tend to go ""We have enough left for one final assault, this one will crush them for sure! Send in everything we have!"".

Although, with enough political will and public pressure, the likelihood of transfer might increase. IMO the challenges are more technical and logistical in nature. (Reminder: Take this with a grain of salt)

1. Parts and Equipment

A. The Warrior is a pretty old IFV, and the spare parts aren't exactly in abundance. There are however, at least 300 + units (out of the 600), and the least serviceable can at least be used to support the more functional ones. Even 150 functional units is already a massive boon to any Brigade that would need them. Though it is an IFV, it is isn't exactly on par with more venerable Bradleys and CV-90s, in terms of protection, battlefield awareness and target acquisition as well as protection, at least more or less only close to the Dutch YPR-65 IFV, an upgraded version of the M113.  


B. The IFV (the more common version) has an issue with its primary armament, a non stabilized 3 round clip reloading 30 mm RARDEN cannon (meaning accuracy problems while moving and has to reload every 3 rounds), as it was designed in 1966 and produced in 1970s. While there are units that have undergone upgrades to the turret and cannon, the primary autocannon is a problem, although Ukraine can make the modifications themselves, perhaps adapting their own indigenous turrets like the *¹BM-7 Parus used by their BTR-4 Bucephalus, and adapted to their older BMP-1 and BMP-2, replacing their original turrets, or the *²M113 Remote Control Weapon system with a lighter armament

2. Training and Organization

A new weapon system requires not only require good logistics but also dedicated combat and maintenance crews. While maybe not as sophisticated as the Bradley or the CV-90, time is still needed to successful familiarize, let alone master the vehicle. Not only that but also time is also needed in integrating them as part of the brigades, especially as part of combined arms tactics and doctrines. Despite this, the Warrior may not be as complex as more modern and upgraded IFVs, and given the speed of Ukrainians in, at least, handling the basics, I don't it would too much of a hassle for them, given their tendency to quick learning and wit. Plus having extra armored vehicles boosts confidence amongst the troops and increases their chances of survival. 

3. Transportation and Delivery

This might be the more concerning in terms of issues regarding the transfer, (or at least being presented as such). Hauling even 300 units of these IFVs present a logistical challenge of transporting them from the British Isles to mainland Europe. Unless Britain really has problems with its logistics capabilities or in terms of funding, there shouldn't be a technical and logistical problem, as Sweden managed to deliver 200 of their older PVB 302s APCs , which are now in service in some of the Ukrainian Brigades. Like I said, unless there are really technical problems like the quality of remaining units and transportation issues, this is more of political rather than logisitical problem. 

*¹ The BM-7 Parus is a locally designed turret, accommodating a variety of weapons, including a 30 mm stabilized autocannon, a 7.62 mm machine gun, an ATGM Pod, and (smoke) grenade launchers.

*² M113 Ukrainian designed RCWS turret is equipped with a 14.5 mm Heavy Machine gun, with a secondary 7.62 mm machine gun.",2025-06-29T10:41:10

I even bought the postage stamps they came out with although I'm sick that I lost the stamps in a move. I didn't know much about Ukraine growing up but as I watched things unfold from 2014 on and then the full scale invasion, I felt upset and enraged in the opening days watching the news and the flood of humanity trying to escape being murdered. The horrific war crimes caught on tape. That young child crying near the Polish border, the people crammed into bomb shelters or basements. There was a young violinist I believe that was playing his instrument while he was in a bunker and they cut in people from around the world joining him.

So far Russia has not sent large numbers of them to fight. Around 22% of Russians are under the age of 18 so they would not be called up to fight either. So roughly 40 million Russian men that could be called up for war exist outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. That's a large number but majority of male Russians tend to be older than the ideal age of a soldier. How many of those are actually physically or mentally fit enough to fight is questionable. Plus how many of them have fled the country or are in hiding. 

Another problem would be replacing those men with other workers. Women could but if they have a job already there would still be a vacancy. North Korea is supposedly sending thousands of workers so there is already a strain on the factories, workshops, and whatever else those North Koreans would work at. 

Russia's demographics are very messed up and Putin is sending hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths and even more will be permanently injured. This combined with losses from world war ll, Stalin's purges and the Russian revolution are devastating. Whole generations have been destroyed. Russian women are having fewer and fewer children. By the end of the century the UN predicts the population will fall 25 to 50 percent from the current population of 146 million. 

Of course Russia could say we're just sending everyone outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. Gender and age doesn't matter, but the signs are already there they're struggling with a smaller workforce and doing something like that could be what finally tips Russia over the point of no return",2025-06-28T06:01:53

Let Putin ship in tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of their workers into areas in the east. Suddenly those cities/areas become North Korean or Chinese majority speaking. They claim what Putin has said about Ukraine, that land belongs to them because of the language. Both countries have nukes so they can tell Putin to deal with it or we bomb you.

A day earlier, EU member states' leaders gave their political consent to extend the sanctions previously imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine. Meanwhile, the participants did not approve the new 18th package of sanctions, which targeted Russia's energy and banking sectors, due to Slovakia's veto.

Zelensky's June 27 decree implements a decision by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council's (NSDC) to synchronize the sanctions against Russia with the EU and G7.

According to the document, sanctions approved by partner states must be submitted to the NSDC for consideration and approval no later than the 15th day after the partner state's decision comes into force.

The Cabinet of Ministers, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and the National Bank of Ukraine must also ensure the implementation of sanctions approved by international partners in Ukraine.

After the 17th package of sanctions against Russia took effect on May 20, Ukraine's allies announced the following day that another round of restrictions was already in the works.

The push for tighter sanctions comes as Russia continues to reject ceasefire proposals and presses forward with military operations.",2025-06-27T14:36:05

He recently ran out of his medical supplies. I have med supplies on hand to send to people in this exact situation. He received some and then immediately needed them when he was hit by an FPV. A Ukrainian teammate used those supplies to save his life. He is seriously injured but alive; he was wearing soft armor that prevented him from injuries to his upper body and he had enough tourniquets and bandages for his legs.

The supplies he got were donated through this fund and brought over by volunteers from Ukraine Frontline. [u/UFL\_Robin](https://www.reddit.com/user/UFL_Robin/) hauled the gauze that treated him.

russia invaded Ukraine, so Ukraine has recieved aid and loans to support it, when before the war Ukraine would have had to do more reforms and anti-corruption to recieve those same loans and aid?

And its somehow the EU's and Ukraine's fault for this? Do you think Ukraine would have suddenly recieved all this aid and these loans if russia hadnt invaded?

This article ignores cause and effect and just looks at the supposed present situation.

""Well Ukraine is at war and the EU has been lenient on aid and loans so Ukraine hasnt ended up doing crucial reforms and anti-corruption laws which they would have needed to do before recieving aid and loans.""

Okay but that is completely ignoring that UKRAINE GOT INVADED BY RUSSIA. All this aid and loans is accelerated because russia invaded Ukraine and that somehow isnt a factor in this? Its the EU's fault for being too lenient on Ukraine to implement reforms. But its not russia's fault for invading Ukraine which made these reforms harder to implement?

Take the Ukrainian version of your letter, translate it back to your native language, and review the result for correctness. Anything that doesn't look right is something you can improve in the Ukrainian version of your letter, until the intended meaning can survive translation back into your own language. 


I'm not sure how well this would work with ChatGPT, but I can tell you it works with Translate, so try both.


Finally, for any Ukrainian word you need help understanding, conjugating (for verbs), declining (for nouns), Wiktionary is often a good reference for that, if the word you need is in there. Just be aware that it's case sensitive, and conjugated verbs or declined nouns can only be found through full text search, because the page title will be in the infinitive form. If you try to use Wiktionary to help yourself construct sentences, I think it's more likely to sound unnatural than stuff that comes from Google Translate or LLM output, but you'll learn more from doing that, and it can help you deconstruct and make sense of automated translations.


If, after all this, you still struggle to find help from a Ukrainian, another lifehack I'd suggest is to volunteer for ENGin: your student will almost certainly be willing to help you with your letter.

I imagined trade disputes, maybe, but not this."" - callsign Kyi",Lysychka-,1866,2025-06-24T01:22:39,Lysychka-,110,"**Why “Kyi”?**

The call sign “Kyi” has a double meaning. First, my last name ends with that syllable. Second, I’m from Kyiv, I was born and raised there, and I worked in Kyiv until the full-scale invasion began.

**Before the War**

Despite past sad experiences with russians, I believed - perhaps naively as an international law graduate - that full-scale war in the 21st century was impossible. I imagined trade disputes, maybe, but not this.

I have two higher education degrees—one in international law and the other in accounting and taxation. I worked in top international law firms that advised multinational companies on tax law, antitrust, intellectual property, and corporate law. Those things now feel infinitely far from what I do today, but back then, they were my world.

**Do You Plan to Return to Law?**

I do plan to return. I don’t see myself as a career military officer. I hope I can eventually reintegrate into civilian life. It won’t be easy; even on leave, the gap between military and civilian life feels enormous.

**Did You Have Any Military Training Before the Invasion?**

Honestly, I never even wanted to serve.

I started as the duty officer at the command center. Then I was promoted—first to deputy chief of staff, and for the past three months, I’ve served as deputy battalion commander.

The chief of staff is the commander’s right hand. I guess I’m the left. I need to understand the situation in the battalion as well as the commander does. I inspect positions, run drills, talk with the troops to ensure we’re not fooling ourselves with false reports. I listen to concerns, hear suggestions, and help organize effective combat work. I also handle documentation, safety protocols, and internal oversight.

**Before the War, You Spoke Russian**

Yes. Even though I could work and speak fluently in Ukrainian, at home I spoke Russian. But after the first missile strikes on Kyiv, my wife and I agreed - no more. I haven’t spoken Russian since. I switched my writing to Ukrainian too.

**What Was the Moment You Decided to Enlist?**

It’s hard to pinpoint. I often think I should’ve volunteered in 2014, but I didn’t believe it would come to this. In 2022, when I saw Kyiv bombed, it felt apocalyptic—like my entire life was being erased. I was overwhelmed at first. Then came rage. “Are we really going to let them do this?” I didn’t think much beyond that. I knew I’d have a tough conversation with my wife—but I went with my friend Volodymyr to enlist.

Would I do it again? Yes. I couldn’t live with myself, hiding somewhere, knowing the fate of my country was being decided without me.

**But We Need Reinforcements**

We need rotation. Those who’ve been serving for four years should have the right to step back and become reservists. Some say “let the MPs or judges serve,” but I say - we need people. If you're afraid of the recruitment office, come to us. We’ll introduce you to your future commander and explain everything.

I mean, Kyi is not entirely wrong.  It's a good, educated, and quite valid perspective.

But I think I can help point out the subtle flaw at work here.

Kyi understands — correctly, I reiterate — that in the 21st century full-scale war is *utterly insane*.  That is the part that they get correct.  With that slight restatement, they are right on the money.

Wars such as Russia's invasions of Ukraine are utter madness.  Complete folly.

What happens next is where the subtle fallacy lies.  And it's a fallacy that many people have made, entirely in good faith.

The fallacy is this:  *If something is utterly insanely self-destructive, that means that therefore no one will ever do it*.

That is how we go from (correctly) understanding the insanity of war, to (incorrectly) concluding that therefore it won't happen.

The problem that Putin posed for so many people is that they do not account for how utterly fucked up and insanely mass-murder-suicidal some people, and some peoples, can be.

Hopefully we will now remember.",2025-06-24T01:30:39

He has never shown any great powers of discernment or subtlety of thought.  He knows how to create fear and sow chaos, that's about it.  Mostly he just reacts to circumstances.

I think he ordered the invasions of Ukraine when he did because he perceived that Russia wasn't going to get Ukraine back by what the Soviets used to call ""political means.""  He doesn't appear to have reflected very much at all on any of his assumptions, he just acted.

The other thing is that on some level he appears to be one of these people who craves revenge against his own people.  In Putin's case, against all those who, in his mind, betrayed his beloved Soviet Union.  I see that as an underrated aspect of his personal motivation.  He not only doesn't care if lots of Russians die — in fact it's hard to explain his actions unless you consider that he might very well actively wish for lots of Russians to die.

We spent over a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan and came back with very little at the conclusion of the war. Afghanistan has remained unchanged since when we started and left. And Iraq we managed to stabilize before ww lowered our presence.

When I looked at Russia and Ukraine. I saw a less prepared army fighting a more prepared country. Make no mistake, Ukraine has outperformed by leaps and bounds. But even in the best case scenario for Russia if they took Kyiv, they were looking at over a decades worth of occupation and terrorism before marching home. If the Americans had issues with Iraq and Afghanistan, the outcome for Russia/Ukraine would be far more difficult.

It is logical to say, ""this was a dumb idea."" The week leading up to the invasion where I heard of Visas getting denied, I still said, ""this is a dumb idea."" And 3 years after, its clear that Putin is keeping this war going because he has no off ramp. He cannot delivery any semblance of victory to his people. If the war ends tomorrow, he will be thrown out of a window by the very people he sent off to war. 

And he will never deliver any semblance of victory to his people. I dont even think the American military can achieve what putin is looking for. The hard part isn't destroying the other army (that of which Putin has failed). The hard part is policing a giant piece of land.

1liolxd,The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace,enocenip,228,2025-06-23T18:38:06,jesterboyd,22,"Just read this on FB:

&gt;I no longer write posts in English about the latest shelling and destruction in Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. I realized that what hurts and burns me at first horrified Europeans, but over time they got used to it. For me, these are the children of my friends sleeping on subway cars or in the bathroom. These are destroyed buildings on such familiar streets of my hometown. Cities where the tragedies of strangers are perceived as our own. Do you know what the scariest thing about tragedy is? Its routinization. Seven dead, five dead, ten wounded. Translated into English, it's just statistics. Sad statistics of Ukrainian life. Horror that is already perceived as the norm.

&gt;The further I go, the less I believe they will understand us. No one will understand what it's like to stay up at night, covering children with your body. What it's like when it flies into your neighbors. How it blows out windows. How floors crumble. Life is falling apart like dust. They won't understand. Even such simple, obvious and terribly terrible things, not to mention more subtle matters.

&gt;The other day, a new neighbor moved in next door to me. A young Russian woman. She was settled by the mayor's office of our town, under a social program, just like me. The only difference is that I ended up here because there is a war in my country. A war that her country unleashed. From which many people close to me died and are suffering. There is no war in her country (yet).

&gt;I asked in the chat room of German volunteers who have been helping Ukrainian refugees all these years, and besides - refugees from everywhere, whether there are really refugees from Russia in our district, and even if so - is it normal to settle us next door, because it's not really okay with me. 

&gt;In response, I received a lot of interesting things, such as quotes from the textbook Leben in Deutschland - about tolerance, helping everyone who needs it, and that not all Russians are necessarily evil, and suddenly this is a good Russian and why shouldn't I check it out. And in general, for us refugees, to have conflicts - in the hostel for asylum seekers, Africans and Syrians are always fighting. What kind of people. 

&gt;And then I understood! “Whatsthedifference” (aka “kakayarazitsa”) - a universal phenomenon. And there is no point in explaining that Africans and Syrians are not in a state of military conflict, and that domestic quarrels have nothing to do with existential conflict. And in general, there is probably no point in explaining anything. That is why this post is in Ukrainian. Like the post quoted below. It is for my own people - those who will understand.

&gt;"" Seven dead were found in the collapsed building. But that's not all. Andriy is standing in front of the house - under the concrete are his 11-year-old daughter Maria and his wife Svitlana. 

&gt;He smokes, drinks water, answers endless calls. And so it has been for more than seven hours. Someone hugs him, asks to talk for a minute. He refuses. 

&gt;He stands and crosses himself. 

&gt;Svitlana and Masha lived on the third floor. Now there is the most debris there and rescuers are removing layer by layer with their hands. 

&gt;The boys are running around - Masha's classmates. They are here with their parents, they lived in neighboring houses, which were also damaged. 

&gt;A Russian Iskander hit the house on Dorohozhychi after four in the morning. 

&gt;There was a resounding alarm, people were returning from shelters. Then the alarm went off again and in two minutes part of the house collapsed. 

&gt;Maria and Svitlana were found dead 12 hours after the explosion.",2025-06-23T21:36:56

It reminds me of the post-WW2 anger of the French that lead us to pursue a Nuclear Program.

Following this, if Ukraine also pursues a nuclear program, it is only a justified echo of France.

Ukraine has been arguing that it is being a shield for Europe. It is of course part rhetoric to garner support, but it is nonetheless true.

I have great admiration for Ukraine, I think in a way it is the new Revolutionary France of our time.

Maybe it is silly of me but for example I saw [the song of Ukraine ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4N82wPpdg8)at Eurovision and I found it very inspiring.

1liolxd,The Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace,enocenip,228,2025-06-23T18:38:06,petecslmao,3,"A very interesting article. From my perspective in the farthest Western Europe, with daily interaction with Ukrainian people. It’s a lot of text in the article for discussion but here are some notes.

""inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians.""

A large part of the West (at least where I live) does see both as very similar, but there are also people who see them as a different and independent people (me and many other people). What are the arguments of those who don’t see them that way? History and the fact that many of them speak Russian daily outside of Ukraine here.

""Pseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence""

Totally agree with this, but there are many people who are tired of politicians and their policies in their countries regarding how they handle corruption and money, and this has an impact on this. However, I don’t think anyone blames ordinary Ukrainian civilians for anything.

""Such ignorance can be intentional""

Thats a fact, a lot of people simply don't care about what happens in Ukraine because they are feeling safe and its not ""their"" war. They carry on with their lives, dealing with their problems.

""The stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied""

I don't think this is true at all, maybe im wrong but i don't see Ukrainian people like that. Maybe quiet, close and cold at first but thats normal when they are in a new country where they don't speak the language, for example.

""they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions""

This is normal nowadays, it does happen with everybody even inside our countries with our own people.

""Are our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation. "" 

They are not forgotten or unwanted, but those people need to show them, right?

I believe there is a lot of misinformation in some Western countries due to language barriers, simply not knowing people from Ukraine or simply not caring at all.",2025-06-24T17:13:15

Your mask is hurting nobody. Wear it if you want. There's nothing wrong with it. 

Masks are still worn for occasional medical reasons (just like they were before Covid) because of stuff like tuberculosis (UA has some drug-resistant strains of TB). People in industry also wear them as dust masks, so they are in stores and available if you look around for them. You won't see people just walking down the street wearing them though.   
  
If a cop checks your ID, they will want you to pull it down for a minute while doing so. You will also have to do that at border checks and while boarding the airplane. The rest of the time, meh - it's up to you. 

Overall, people in Ukraine seem to be more reactive than proactive with health stuff. Far more likely to \*treat\* infections than \*prevent\* infections (I say this as a medic comparing my experience there vs. the USA - in general, Ukrainians are FAR more into taking antibiotics than doing things like creating an aseptic medical workspace. Same goal, different methodology). This means that less of their life is burdened by preventative measures overall - but it also means they have the highest HIV rate in Europe, so the philosophy is not without flaws. 

FYI - there's a new Covid vaccine this year. Get it before traveling internationally - the newly-dominant strains of the virus are nowhere near as dangerous as the old ones, but it's still pretty damn unpleasant.

Plus, Putin can't necessarily risk pissing off NK.  A significant amount of Russian ammo comes from them these days.

Former President Yoon Suk-Yoel went mad after surrounding himself with fascist shamans. After listening to their advices and conspiracy theories about “election fraud”, he attempted to impose martial law and try to engineer Putinesque false flag attacks to overthrow democracy. There were traitorous and cowardly generals in the high command who followed insane orders. So, troops were deployed in National Assembly, but protestors blocked them and rank-and-file soldiers refused illegal orders. 

National assembly overturned martial law and impeached that maniac. The court removed him and the government called for a snap election. However, political chaos continued for months as he incited bunch of far-right lunatics to cause chaos in the streets. Far-right rioters stormed a courthouse and assaulted college campuses. It is rumored that those far-right even smuggled Russian weapons and foreign mercenaries to maximize chaos and kill elected officials. Military was under de facto paralysis as the top generals and defense minister for joining December 3rd insurrection. The whole military apparatus is under scrutiny.

2. Curwef is different in regions. Info is here: [https://visitukraine.today/blog/3209/what-is-the-curfew-in-different-regions-of-ukraine-in-2025?srsltid=AfmBOor0U7t4lxjs12fIi9fJ-zaLuY-JrFE0uR8cwHcUwJtTCdD\_NGea#curfews-in-ukraine-in-2025](https://visitukraine.today/blog/3209/what-is-the-curfew-in-different-regions-of-ukraine-in-2025?srsltid=AfmBOor0U7t4lxjs12fIi9fJ-zaLuY-JrFE0uR8cwHcUwJtTCdD_NGea#curfews-in-ukraine-in-2025)

You are not allowed to walk while curwef. The police don't really monitor this. But if they see you on the street, they may check your documents. People can often be delayed because of train delays, but overall this doesn't have terrible consequences.

3. Hitchhiking is not very popular in Ukraine but can work. Very random think, imo.

4. As for forests, it is prohibited to visit them in:

Kyiv; Cherkasy; Poltava; Volyn (the region borders Belarus); Vinnytsia (transit trails can be visited); Kharkiv; Sumy.

In addition, in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, it is possible to visit forests, but it is prohibited to enter them in passenger cars if there is no transit route through the forest.

5. There are no problems with mines in populated areas and transport arteries. Not to mention closed areas or eastern regions. You can google the specific forest or interested area. It's ok if you find any recent activities.

6. I like DREAM hostel in Lviv it was funny to live here with my friends.

  
I don't have expirience in hitchhiking, bus or train sounds very good for me xD

Go to Medyka/Hrebenne/Korchowa whereever your need, cross the border on foot and then get the cheap bus from the border point to Lviv. Get the hostel before arrival, take your good time in Lvіv, then you can take the the short way - by buses or trains to Mukachevo or Chernivtsi, and then to Romanian border. Or you can ride to Odesa and then to Romania by bus.

And if you being spotted on foot near the ouposts, checkpoints or military facilites, there is a big chanse that you will be arrested and questioned by [SSU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Service_of_Ukraine). Since there is a lot of russian spies accross the country searching for military locations and equipment. This is seriose, and you should act wisely and seriousely as well. Drivers are also not recommended to pick up hitchiking passengers, again, due to possible actions by enemy reconnaissance groups.  
The situation with mines is very serious, especially in areas close to active combat zones. People should not go to the forest, as mined areas are not always marked with signs for not to expose military facilities. And there are quite a lot military facilities around the country now, especially along the roads. And in most of these areas, the surrounding areas are mined but not always marked.",2025-06-21T16:48:45

Hitchhiking is not really regulated but you may have problems at the roadblocks (very randomly though) and your trip **should be finished before curfew**. Otherwise charges are probable. The least that could happen is being arrested till morning.",2025-06-25T02:12:17

But that's the reason we ask advice in life, to double check our logic. There are many reasons there is no traditional hitchhiking in Ukraine, the main one being that most men fear being mobilized and there is low trust of strangers here. If you use an app there will be higher likelihood of arranging rides around. Also the buses and trains here are dirt cheap and always running so there is just no need. Good luck.",2025-06-20T17:13:06

The ""lethal aid"" in that bill is only *$25.7 billion*, so I don't know where you took from that ""40 billion in lethal aid in 2024"". At the moment overall military aid from US is about $60 billion.

The total amount isn't always raw material that gets there. It can be building of the sending countries defense industry also. I said 40 as that was minus some of the defense building. Just depends on where tou slice it. With 25 being the raw materials actually getting there and 60 being the total allocated funds. The us is and was still the largest aid provider of any country.

1ledawm,1.8 Million Shells for Ukraine: Czech-Led Ammo Surge Marks War Turning Point,UNITED24Media,3248,2025-06-18T10:06:55,Viburnum__,4,"You said yourself ""40 billion in lethal aid in 2024"", which is simply not true, even if we consider all military aid in 2024 it still won't reach 40 billion.

Also, part of the aforementioned aid bill went to cover the 'deficit' that comes from overvaluing the aid that they covered with this bill. Which means that what older weapons US send to Ukraine they still charged for replacement value in the end. So only $20 billion in the bill was for **Military equipment.**

&gt;A curious element is that the legislation requests $13.4 billion to replenish stockpiles but only $7.8 billion of new drawdown authority. This discrepancy implies a preexisting deficit, likely stemming from accounting changes [made](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-weapons-surplus-funding-72eeb6119439146f1939d5b1973a44ef) last summer. The accounting changes priced equipment at the depreciated value rather than the replacement value. 

Not to mention they also added in this bill $7.3 billion for ""US forces in Europe"" and call it 'aid to Ukraine' and before anyone argue without reading the bill, it is not money for training, intel or other stuff, they are included separately in other categories of the bill.",2025-06-19T15:16:41

So you still believe what you said about ""40 billion in lethal aid in 2024"" is true even if it is proven false?

&gt;The us has delivered more lethal aid than any other country. Do you agree or disagree?

I don't need to agree or disagree, it is a fact, at least for now, but what you claimed is not. 

You remind me of the people, likely from US, who half a year into the full scale invasion claimed ""US gave Ukraine hundreds of billions in weapons"", because they wanted to show off their supposed superiority while at the same time being completely ignorant or just can't stroke their own inflated ego without lying.",2025-06-20T13:21:59

""All these surpluses must be destroyed. All international algorithms are known. They must be reduced, disposed of, and guaranteed,"" Grushko said, without offering specifics.

The remarks reflect Moscow's growing list of maximalist demands presented in its so-called ""peace memorandum"" during recent negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2.

The document calls for Ukraine to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and four partially occupied regions — Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — and demands full Ukrainian troop withdrawal and demobilization.

Grushko argued that Western weapons aid threatens not only Russia but also Europe, warning that arms could end up on black markets.

""It's crazy how reckless some politicians are, still flooding the market with weapons,"" he said.

There is no credible evidence that Kyiv has diverted Western weapons or fueled arms trafficking — a narrative promoted by Russian propaganda to undermine support for Kyiv.

In general “healthier foods” might not be the best option. There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, these people are facing food shortage issues. Calorie dense foods would be more beneficial for those who can’t count on three square meals a day. Secondly, many of these refugees have young children. A food truck that offers items many children tend to turn their noses away from will add more stress to the life of a single mom with three or four young children. A food item that almost all children will readily eat is wholly appropriate here. Lastly, the smell of fries will attract crowds. This event is about giving people a reason to smile. It is meant to help them forget for a moment just how scary their lives are right now. A cup full of steamed broccoli won’t have the same psychological benefits.",2025-06-16T02:48:35

Bridges are hard to bring down if you can’t roll up a truck of mines or shaped charges to their foundations, but tunnels… tunnels are less hard.

Before the U.S. shifted to the “operational reserve” concept in the 1970s and 1980s, the strategic reserve was considered its best, brightest, most capable, and deep bench of war-winning talent and capability if it just decided it needed to take the gloves off against the Soviets.

What Putin has are his residual, bottom-barrel Soviet leftovers and desperation plays as he looks for anything in his very limited experience that might salvage at best something his greater investment in information operations can frame as “victory.”

RF interference in the 2016 election was already stated by US agencies responsible for national security. Explain to me why Russia would interfere in an election when they didn't have good reason to feel their candidate would be reliable? There is a consistent pattern and only one conclusion, which is at minimum he is an asset, makes the most sense. 

Trump we know for sure has kompromat on him, just look at Michael Wolff latest interview who has personally seen some of it and goes into descriptions of him and Epstein. 

Russian mafia were right around Trump literally in his buildings. Opportunities at compromising him would undoubtedly have been observed keenly. Whether it's fear or not, or just bribery or a mixture, he is clearly an asset. Trump does not support RF because of personal ideological opinions. 

It would never had occurred to him to launch a presidential bid by attacking NATO, which at such time would have harmed his chances, that came directly from the people he met with in Moscow, it's simply vannishingly unlikely to be a coincidence. 

It's 100% known that Trumps personal life makes him vulnerable to potentially harmful compromat. It's known what kind of personality and intellectual defects he has. FSB grooming of assets relies on working these vulnerabilities and needs. 

At this point anyone still in denial of this still, should consider they are afraid of seeing the truth, because not acknowledging all the signs here make it very likely he is an asset, it can only be their own biases stopping people from seeing it.",2025-06-13T16:09:45

Here we have the peace talk plan he had propsed with Russia and Ukraine to start off with - 

&gt;What Russia gets under Trump's proposal

&gt;""De jure"" U.S. recognition of Russian control in Crimea.

&gt;""De-facto recognition"" of the Russia's occupation of nearly all of Luhansk oblast and the occupied portions of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

&gt;A promise that Ukraine will not become a member of NATO. The text notes that Ukraine could become part of the European Union.

&gt;The lifting of sanctions imposed since 2014.

&gt;Enhanced economic cooperation with the U.S., particularly in the energy and industrial sectors.

And then see how he also treated Zelensky at the white house and stopped giving them weapons and aide, even after that order was lifted too! And then we have [the 5 times he's met with Putin and no one was allowed to know what was being discussed. ](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings.html) On top of that we also have [""Senate panel finds Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election"" ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election) which both a republican led panel and the Judiciary and Homeland Security looked into themselves. Seems to me you'd owe a lot to a country/man that helps win you a presidency.

Not to mention [from the project 2025 tracker policies on cybersecurity here](https://www.project2025.observer/?sort=status-desc&amp;subjects=JOxu3HkX8YLObmxj7xUz9) this particular policy -

&gt;End Cybercom's participation in federal efforts to ""fortify"" U.S. elections.

&gt;*Note: Secretary Hegseth ordered Cyber Command ""to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions*

&gt;Remove Cybercom from the oversight of the National Security Agency. (Policy #2)

&gt;This refers to a policy shift that removes U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) from federal efforts to protect elections from cyber threats. CYBERCOM has historically played a role in countering foreign interference, particularly from adversaries like Russia and China. The decision to end its participation could make U.S. elections more vulnerable to cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.

&gt;The move is part of a broader agenda outlined in Project 2025, a policy framework developed by the Heritage Foundation. It argues that CYBERCOM’s involvement in election security is ""partisan"" and should be discontinued.
Critics warn that this could empower foreign actors to manipulate U.S. elections and weaken national security. 

&gt;Additionally, Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly ordered CYBERCOM to halt all planning against Russia, including offensive cyber operations. This directive could significantly alter U.S. cyber defense strategies and limit responses to potential threats

And finally Trump's top negotiator and advisor Steve witkoff doing this interview in mid april-[""Trump's top negotiator says they are excited for commercial business opportunities with Putin soon."" ](https://archive.is/20250416010920/https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-trump-negotiator-steve-witkoff-excited-about-commercial-opportunities-with-putin/) which is also why trump is only mad about the war currently, you can't conduct business in the open if it's ongoing and people hate Russia. How can people not see how this all equates to him most definitely being pretty damn intentional now?

*edit, I forgot his ties to Russian mafia as well

&gt;Starting in 2003, the Trump Organization worked with Felix Sater, who had a 1998 racketeering conviction for a $40 million stock fraud scheme orchestrated by the Russian mafia, and who had then become an informant against the mafia.[402][403] Trump's attorney has said that Sater worked with Trump scouting real estate opportunities, but was never formally employed.[404]

He also went to Russia in 1987 and wanted to build trump towers there and had his lawyers working on it, and tried hard to be accepted by the oligarchs. And now we have this as of June 5th-

&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace, even as Germany’s new chancellor appealed to him as the “key person in the world” who could halt the bloodshed by pressuring Vladimir Putin.

&gt;In an Oval Office meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the U.S. president likened the war in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in February 2022 — to a fight between two children who hate each other. Trump said that with children, “sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” adding that he relayed the analogy to Putin in a call this week.

&gt;“I said, ‘President, maybe you’re going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot,’ because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart, before they’re able to be pulled apart,” Trump said. “You see in hockey, you see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds, let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”

[the 2016 election was proven to be rigged ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election) by the Senate panel and the CIA. And by the way this Senate panel that confirmed the evidence was Republican based.

&gt;The nearly 1,000-page report, the fifth and final one from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee on the Russia investigation, details how Russia launched an aggressive effort to interfere in the election on Trump’s behalf. It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and says other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin’s aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers.

The report issued several recommendations on that front, including that the FBI should do more to protect presidential campaigns from foreign interference.

Random but relevant I was reading stories about American military personnel who are still unaccounted for from different wars,  and there was a pilot who was shot down during the Korean War, and taken prisoner. The last intel we have of him was he was turned over to the Soviets and taken to Russia, never to be seen or heard from again. My hope for him is that he was killed quickly or used as a resident in one of those fake American towns they used to train the KGB. But that's probably not what happened to him. 

They activity participated in the Vietnam War (yeah, we shouldn't have been there either but that's besides the point.  Thanks a lot,  France) and took down several of our aircraft during the cold war. 

They backed middle-eastern terrorists and dictators just to go against us. That wasn't the Soviets, that was the guy in charge right fucking now, getting Americans killed. 

Oh yeah, and they broke the Olympic peace to fully invade a neighboring country under a pretext so thin anyone with eyes could see right through it, after inciting instability and violence in that neighbor for years and already stealing some of their land.

We also had a big fight for independence from Mexico in the great battle of the 4th of July, amazing coincidence actually when you think about them winning that war on such an important holiday for Americans but that was a proud day for ICE wasn’t it, they say never to fight up hill but they fought everywhere, lots of hills, trenches, tree houses, boats, that was a big one for us lots of illegal immigrants were defeated and I think the fireworks in the background would have really made a noisy battle lots of dogs barking and you know they eat them, they eat the cats, all the pets even pet chickens and their babies before they had a chance to hatch. If I’d been president though you know what I would have done? It’s easy when you know what you’re doing.

""After the [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement), the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) pursued a [rapprochement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapprochement) with [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany). On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union signed a [non-aggression pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) with Germany which included a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet [spheres of influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheres_of_influence), anticipating potential ""territorial and political rearrangements"" of these countries Germany [invaded Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland) on 1 September 1939, starting [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). The Soviets [invaded eastern Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Poland) on 17 September Following the [Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War) with Finland, the Soviets were [ceded territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Peace_Treaty) by Finland. This was followed by annexations of the Baltic states and [parts of Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_Northern_Bukovina).

On 22 June 1941, [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) launched [Operation Barbarossa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa), an invasion of the Soviet Union with the largest invasion force in history, leading to some of the largest battles and most horrific atrocities.""",2025-06-13T14:28:06

That my family won’t have to flee west.”",Lysychka-,2584,2025-06-12T12:48:24,Lysychka-,103,"“It was the beginning of the war, the ATO. I had to run around a bit with various volunteer battalions and bend the truth a little about my age. When the command found out I wasn’t 18 yet, it was too late to kick me out. And I had already achieved my goal — I was at war. At the time, it seemed completely right and logical to me. Crimea had just been seized, and we were preparing for partisan activity. One day, our trainer called us and told us to meet at a point. We built a checkpoint — it was the first Pavlohrad checkpoint,” Myroslav said.

“My mom called me when I was in Opytne or Vodiane and asked me to tell the truth. I did — and her response surprised me. She gave me her blessing, you could say. She told me, ‘Take care of yourself and kill them,’” the soldier said.

In 2022, he was wounded in Popasna during a combat mission.

“I was hit in the inner thigh — at least that’s what I thought at the time. It was almost a direct firefight with a tank. I was really lucky the shrapnel got stuck on the side. If it had been a centimeter higher, it would’ve hit an artery and I’d have bled out… There was only one ‘road of life’ to get out on foot. I walked eight kilometers with the shrapnel in my knee,” he said.

After recovering, Myroslav returned to the front. He emphasized that people in the rear should not have to understand what life is like for soldiers on the front line.

“People in Soledar or Bakhmut really understood us because they lived the same way — in the same basements, under the same bombs, with the same hunger, cold, and lack of basic conditions. Infantry bears the brunt of the first blow and fights this war so that people in the rear don’t have to understand what’s happening here,” he said.

The only thing he dreams about is that a year from now, things in his hometown won’t be worse than they are today.

“That there won’t be Russian rags \[flags\] here, that they won’t rebuild Lenin statues. I dream that my city remains Ukrainian — that’s my only dream. That my family won’t have to flee west. I never imagined my city would be this close to the front. Now Pavlohrad is like Pokrovsk was during the ATO days. And that’s a bad thing. I dream that Russian soldiers won’t get even a kilometer closer,” Myroslav said.

Some stories are lucky enough to capture both.  
  
Yevhen Lyr ([eugene\_lir](https://www.instagram.com/eugene_lir/?hl=en)) is a Ukrainian writer, translator, volunteer, and soldier. His story is closely tied to the 2023 Russian sabotage of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine — one of the most devastating war crimes Moscow committed during the full-scale invasion.  
  
Lyr witnessed the aftermath of the flood firsthand: first as a volunteer helping civilians, then as a serviceman stationed in Kherson for a year. That dual perspective shaped “The Flood” — an English-language novel that blends real stories, fiction, and the often-overlooked spirit of Ukraine’s south, in what he calls a book of love.

Every war features weapons from all over the world. As long as you don't send regular forces to fight on the ground, it's diplomatically speaking fair game. Even when you send troops in support, it's considered a provocation but not open war. 

Ukraine already has plenty of weapons manufactured in Europe and the US. A Ukrainian factory in one of our countries would just be *less* provocative than sending our own weapons if anything.

A million casualties and Putin isn't facing any discontent. There was a very brief period, when Russia did its ""partial mobilization"" in 2022, when I thought there may be protests but no. It's not really just any one thing, it's a whole combination of factors.

There's the overall Russian culture of ""так там лучше знают"", ""как наверху решат"" - basically the belief that those in power know best and it's not the common person's place to decide anything. This isn't some Putin thing, it's an old approach that predates not just Putin but his grandfather as well.

There's the pervasive propaganda. In the first days of the invasion, Russia's last free newspaper, radio station and TV channel were shut down. If people aren't actively seeking out other information, and only passively consuming what the TV says, they won't hear about a million casualties. They'll hear about Russian heroes slowly but steadily advancing against hordes of Anglo-Saxon backed Nazis, with rare minor setbacks.

There's poverty and geographic dispersion. A million casualties is a lot. But Russia is a large country, the casualties are distributed throughout it, and mostly affect poor regions. Russia's poor regions are really, really poor. People in poor, remote rural towns have even less power than others if they did protest, and some are actually seeing a financial profit from the war because a soldier who survived a year on the front lines can afford much more than locals.

There's a totalitarian approach, imprisonment of anyone who objects. This is one of the biggest changes in Russia since 2022. Before that, it was dangerous to be an opposition politician or journalist, but you were pretty much safe as an average person voicing disagreement with Putin. Now, people are arrested and punished for any opposition to the war. Flowers at a Ukrainian monument? Arrest. Say ""stop the war""? Arrest. Write a post online about Russia striking civilian targets? Arrest. All this has a strong chilling effect.

Anyone who could be an organizer of protests or a rallying figure is imprisoned or killed. And if soldiers are unhappy, the Wagner rebellion showed that Russia knows how to deal with that, too - blow up the leader of the rebellion and the rest fall in line.

I'd like to be proven wrong but I don't expect any sort of mass protests or opposition in Russia.",2025-06-09T00:11:35

Pragmatically Russia should stop now, it should've never started. However I agree with Anders Puck Nielson that this is about being a great power. Hence why they've only offered surrender terms so far. As soon as this war is over Russia stops being a great power, but while it's going they can pretend to be on the same level as China, India, America or Western Europe.

The russian state budget, which is explicitly a wartime budget for the first time this year, is based on oil revenues with a base of at least $69.7 a barrel, but oil prices have remained below that threshold for many weeks and are expected to fall further in the foreseeable future.   
Since no one is currently lending money to russia due to the inherent risks, the state can only rely on its own resources, all of which - currency devaluation, higher interest rates, higher taxes, lower pensions, etc. - have short-term negative consequences and would weaken russia's ability to continue its war of aggression against Ukraine even further.

There is a lot of interesting information about russia's economic situation on r/CollapseOfRussia/, some of it from official government sources, so the negative development of the russian economy is definitely not a secret. 

The only chance for russia to recover economically in the near future is for the Trump administration to lift sanctions and fully resume trade with russia - Trump is obviously very interested in this, but the EU and other Western states will certainly not go along with this step, so it is uncertain whether russia will receive relevant economic help from outside in the foreseeable future.",2025-06-09T10:36:26

The emptying of russian equipment bases, steady drop in recruitment, increasing cost of war efforts, all these were always tracking to become a disaster late 2025-start of 2026. mid to late 2026 is a wild territory, but everyone agrees there's nothing good for russia there. More like a complete breakdown of key supports to war effort.

Regarding Zelenskyy's statement - it's partly just political messaging, while we ramp up our bombing campaign inside russia it would be extremely helpful to us if allies finally took their task seriously (mainly US). That would, indeed, dramatically shorten the timeline of the end of the war by mounting unprecedented pressure from all sides, while further reinforcing AFU.

So, like, I was not surprised by thing that were happening in the past, I wasn't expecting a short war, I wasn't expecting any side to buckle and collapse in short term. 2026 seems like a year when all the decisive cards are to be played, but the sooner russia kicks the bucket - the better, everyone agrees on that.",2025-06-09T22:31:17

But I have a strong opinion about what comes next: 

- Either nothing (at least not for several years) when Russia is forced to give up and withdraw from Ukraine.

- Or, if Russia is able to declare a win for them, a new special military operation against Moldavia. And then Russia will bring all the remaining former Soviet states that are moderately friendly under its rule, which would replenish Russia's economy a bit. And then the Baltic states are due. Russia will ask them ""friendly"" to leave NATO and come under the Russian umbrella peacefully. Or else! Which means: Military invasion, even if they are still NATO members. Which would lead to a full-on (conventional) War with NATO, or: MAD with nuclear weapons, which would most likely eradicate all inhabited areas of Russia and Europe. Not sure about America.

This development is quite obvious to me but I have no idea beyond that.",2025-06-10T08:22:09

There is no way Russia leaves without being physically pushed out.

It would be interesting to see how this plays out if their economy collapse. Even tho that may sound good, it would create a huge powervacum which could create a lot of chaos.

Agreed but they could declare that a win and if the war ends this way before their economy collapses, they'll continue. IMHO.

&gt; It would be interesting to see how this plays out if their economy collapse. Even tho that may sound good, it would create a huge powervacum which could create a lot of chaos. 

In that case, I bet that China would go in ""to avoid chaos"". China enjoys the situation very much.

&gt; At this point I'm just praying Ukraine will get accepted into NATO. So they are ensured a somewhat peaceful future.

Me too.  
Alas, if the war ends with a (partial) win of Russia, this would be difficult to do. Russia might even push more and more to avoid that.  
If the war ends with Russia's economy collapsing, there would be no need to rush and I guess that some more states in the region may want to enter NATO. Because then the next biggest thread after Russia would be China. (I think that China isn't actively interested in conquering but if there is a super easy/cheap opportunity and they can sell it publicly in the name of world peace (and get the sweet resources :P), then China might be tempted.)",2025-06-10T10:34:03

* russia is deep into war economy, it's the only thing that keeps them alive atm
* russias civil industries were or are being sacrificed in favour of said war economy, attempts to revert back to normal economy WILL assasinate the country economically
* there's no incentive to stop the war for above reasons
* while war economy is alive, it is slowing down, because the main reason of it soaring in the first place - enormous soviet stocks to refurbish - are being exhausted, with no real possibilities to dramatically increase new equipment production because of cut or extremely inefficient supply chains
* sanctions aren't going away and likely to get worse in case of continued war or inconclusive ending to the war. I believe they won't be lifted for a long time from now.
* as such, russia is steadily losing combat capability and political leverage
* fronts are fluid, but a bunch of fields or microscopic villages are a poor trade for casualties. No major cities are occupied (apart from Mariupol) since 2022. Because of the point above, none will be occupied in the future.
* outside support for russia will drop due to money issues
* Ukrainian deep strikes won't help them cope with the pressure
* Ukraine sees the long game and won't go for less than russians fucking off back to the swamps. Ukraine, arguably, has the morale and resources to get to that point.

At some point in 2026 russians will really try to settle this as favourably to them as they can, which is likely to fail 'cause of lost leverage. If Ukraine can throw in a successful offensive somewhere - it would help, but not required.  
And we will go through those cycles for some time - russians taking L's between attempts at negotiations. They can attempt to dig in and try to hold the ground, but this opens another can of worms for them as it will clearly show they are incapable of honest talks (all the consequences will ensue).   
  
Until they give up. This could be as early as the end of 2026 - sometime 2027.  
  
Not to mention a miriad of internal issues that could come to pass.

Everything has a compounding effect.

This is the scenario I can very well see happening, I think I gave at least some fair reasoning for it.

I don't want to address nukes as it is talked to death at this point - russia uses nukes - the whole world is so fucked, this war doesn't matter at that point.",2025-06-10T10:27:57

But Russia also seems to go for the long game. At least 1.5 years more :-( And even seeing that their advances are minimal, they are not retreating. Meanwhile, humans die. Btw, I'm so glad about the deep strikes Ukraine does, now the Russian populace feels the war.

&gt; At some point in 2026 russians will really try to settle this as favourably to them as they can, which is likely to fail 'cause of lost leverage.

IMHO they will rattle with all they have left and intensify their attacks. Then they will retreat slowly and leave lots of mines behind.

IMHO it's already well known that they are incapable/unwilling of honest talks, so that wouldn't be much of a problem for them.

&gt; ...
&gt; This is the scenario I can very well see happening, I think I gave at least some fair reasoning for it.

Me too and I agree with your reasoning. But 1.5 - 2 years are long. And then? I bet China will ""take over"" the devastated Russia and present themselves as ""the savior"" - but will they then try to conquer Ukraine, too? If I would be forced to bet, I would bet against it, simply because it wouldn't help China and would make taking over Russia more complicated and difficult. But... I have no idea.

And yes, the nukes. If it would come to that, there would be nothing left to worry about.",2025-06-10T11:52:18

Also, China is not stupid to go for European land, it simply isn't worth it. What's likely is they gain a lot of russias east territories, while moscow is boiling in all the issues (economic, social, lost war, etc.), unable to do a thing about it, except scream and seethe.

Yes. As long as a Russian government exists, China can buy land cheaply.

&gt; What's likely is they gain a lot of russias east territories, while moscow is boiling in all the issues (economic, social, lost war, etc.), unable to do a thing about it, except scream and seethe.

I might have been misunderstood, I mean, once no functional Russian government exists anymore, Chinese ""peace troops"" may (peacefully) move in, ""to assure peace and prevent chaos."" I agree that China doesn't want an open war, neither with Russia nor Europe nor America. The exception is Taiwan. And maybe India, but I'm quite confident that China won't start an occupation operation (military or not) against anyone but Taiwan. At least not within the next few years. China is a position that enables them to play such stuff much smarter, and I believe they will be smart. My opinion. So yeah, I guess we agree here, too, by and large.

The war was tough on everyone. Back then the economy shifted spending to war and everyone was affected. I'm not too sure how it is now. It wasn't a jovial and upbeat place. They were still dealing with Russian era corruption and incompetence. The ingenuity and brilliance of the Ukrainian youth was breaking through. 

Everyone I spoke to was happy to speak to me and happy to see me there. Beautiful cities, people going through difficulties, loss and struggle. Time will favour the Ukrainian people.",2025-06-08T21:09:29

I travelled to Ukraine during the war. Here is my perspective as a European who visited there :

- Most of Ukraine is very safe. You are taking a risk by going of course, but it is in my opinion a quite mild risk statistically speaking. You can make yourself safer by getting the official air raid alert app and going to shelters if anything happens. If in doubt, follow Ukrainians ; they will always know what to do. Whatever happens, don't panic. Your first air raid sirens are gonna be stressful no matter how prepared you think you are ; it's not a normal feeling (or at least it shouldn't be, but for Ukrainians it has become normal unfortunately).

- Ukraine's economy needs all the help it can get. Spending your money there financially helps Ukrainians in a very direct manner.

- Ukraine's morale directly depends on foreign support. By showing up and showing you care, you are doing your part to let Ukrainians know they are not alone in this.

- Make sure you respect all laws and do not under any circumstance capture footage or photographs of anything related to the military or the government, no matter how insignificant it may seem. When in doubt, do not photograph. Do not film or photograph air defense activity should you encounter any.
Be curious. Many Ukrainians are eager to tell you about their country and answer your questions. Listening to them is a great way to bring back stories to tell your peers to educate them. But do not ever ask a Ukrainian whether they've lost someone in the war. The answer to that will obviously be yes with virtually everyone you will meet. You do not need to ask that question and frankly, I find it disrespectful and ignorant to do so.

- There will never be a better time to visit Ukraine than right now. There are very few tourists obviously, so you'll get front-row seats to everything you visit. Seize that opportunity.

- Maybe be a bit careful about placating your interest in Chornobyl. Some Ukrainians can be somewhat offended by foreigners who are fascinated by it just because they saw it in video games. Foreigners used to treat the place more as an extreme amusement park rather than a place of significant historical importance and pain for Ukraine. It's okay to be interested, but make sure that interest is healthy. Do not be like these people who visit Auschwitz just to take selfies on the train tracks with their Gucci bags.

- Ukrainian food is amazing. Go visit restaurants that serve traditional food and make sure to get very addicted.

- What you are doing is the opposite of insensitive. Insensitive would be to not care. You are showing you care extremely by making the effort to go there. Therefore you are not insensitive.

As for recommendations, I can only give some for Kyiv :
- The Mother Ukraine statue at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, as well as the military vehicle museums you can find around.
- Holodomor museum (check the opening days, it's not always open).
- Babi Yar, the site of large-scale Nazi atrocities in Kyiv, nearby you can also find the Kyiv TV tower that shows damage sustained by russian missiles in 2022.
- Saint Sophia Cathedral and Pechersk Lavra monastery.
- Independance Square, where the Euromaidan protests took place, it features lots of memorials and even a painting by Banksy if you are observant enough.
- Go have a walk around the government district. You cannot enter but it is impressive to see the military presence that protects it.

There are way too many places to list them all, but these are the main ones I would not miss on my first trip there. I hope you enjoy your trip to the fullest!",2025-06-09T03:13:47

Visiting the touristy city of Lviv should be fine, and nobody will bat an eye. If anything local business there will appreciate the spending.  Keep a kyiv trip short, or non at all if possible since Putler is constantly having his Orcs lob drones and missiles at it, if only to keep yourself safe from the crossfire.  You won't stand out on Kyiv or be seen as insensitive but understand the risks currently.


Visiting a city like Kherson is much more dangerous and insensitive since you could get caught in the crossfire and take up resources that locals could using.  And you're not going there so already you're making a good choice.


I would probably stick to only Lviv (or other areas on the west area, such as where my family is from like Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk, where there are less missiles and drones being launched by orcs at then versus Kyiv).  Understand the risks, download the air raid app, and make smart decisions.",2025-06-08T21:48:19

I just finished a two and half week trip in Ukraine a month ago. The folks I chatted with all had very different attitudes to the current war situation and only one person thought it was not worth the risk going there. I had more surprised responses from locals in parts of Eastern Turkey (lots and frequent) than from Ukrainians (absolutely zero). Ukrainians don’t strike me as outwardly demonstrative though. No one thought I was special or brave either. I was pretty much ignored the whole time except when I was in direct conversation, meaning I didn’t get looked at by passersby. 

Once at a cafe I sat next to a Polish American guy who, by the way he was talking with wait staff and what he was saying, really seemed to think he was special just for being there, what a peanut. 

English is spoken a lot otherwise I used a translation app. Amazingly never missed a bus or a train and never got bombed. I was most nervous about Odesa and fluctuating intensity of ballistic missile strikes as the peace talks were happening in Turkey at that time. The second most recent heavy ballistic strike happened just after I left Kyiv- I was expecting it while I was still there. Some local who I met in the train leaving Ukraine came from Dnipro and they thought Dnipro was safer than Odesa, when I told them I went there. So many add Dnipro to your list.  

My trip - bus Chisinau to Odesa, 3 nights Odesa. Train to Kyiv, 5 nights. Train to Ternopil, bus to Kamyanets Podilski, bus to Ivano-frankivist, one night each. Bus to Odesa, 7 nights.

What does it take to run the finances of a country at war?

That question is at the heart of this week’s conversation with Ukraine’s finance minister, Sergii Marchenko. It comes at a time when Ukraine’s leaders continue to navigate a complex relationship with the US, and just a few short months after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was humiliated in a now infamous White House news conference. Relations have improved since the signing of a minerals deal in April, but uncertainties remain about the US government’s attitude toward Ukraine and the longevity of its support.

Against this backdrop, Marchenko has to keep many balls in the air. He must help preserve his country’s financial infrastructure. He must ensure international donors and allies have confidence in where their money and other support goes. He must ensure the state has enough money to pay soldiers, doctors, teachers — and to buy weapons. And he must encourage investors, even in wartime.

The remarks come amid continuing Russian offensives in eastern and northern Ukraine, along with escalating diplomatic efforts that have yet to yield a ceasefire.

According to Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), Moscow hopes to seize the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts by this fall and establish a buffer zone along Ukraine's northern border with Russia.

The second phase of the plan envisions more ambitious territorial gains, including an advance into southern Ukraine aimed at cutting the country off from the sea.

""Unfortunately, they are not speaking about peace. They are preparing for war,"" Palisa said during a press briefing at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.

The warning comes days after Russia presented Ukraine with a so-called ""peace memorandum"" during a second round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

The document, published by Russian state media outlet TASS, demands that Kyiv recognize Russia's claimed annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts — Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — and fully withdraw from them.

Their whole history as ""Russians"" starting with the self-coronation of Ivan the Terrible in 1547 as the first czar of ""All **Russia**"" (i.e. not only the Grand Prince of Muscovy) is [nothing more than a sordid and unforgivable reel of imperialism and colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_Russia#Table_of_changes) that more than rivals what those oh-so-evil Western European colonists pulled off.

Russia uses lots of drones and uses them effectively, they're the main threat to soldiers on both sides within several kilometers of the zero line.

Ukraine was well ahead on drones early on because drones were an unexpected, unconventional weapon. Russia invaded with a massive force, Ukraine wasn't receiving anything heavier than anti-tank launchers from the West, so had to improvise and try out various weapons. Some of the weapons from the first weeks of the war are long since irrelevant (like Bayraktars), but drones clearly turned out to be more effective than anyone anticipated. So Ukraine continued to improve at drone warfare and eventually Russia also started adopting drones as a key component.

Fiber optic drones, the latest major development, were first deployed by Russians, so they're not just catching up. I think it's even borderline insulting towards the Ukrainian defenders to pretend they're fighting some chaotic bunch of alcoholics with no technology. No, Ukraine is fighting a large hostile army that adapts to the battlefield. Russians clearly have a lot of organizational problems, and they're constantly following a strategy that treats soldier lives as very cheap, but it's not the same force as invaded in 2022. Russia knows how to use drones now. Russia doesn't have fifty-kilometer convoys getting stuck for a week without fuel. Russia no longer puts all the ammo for a brigade into one warehouse that can be blown up. Their overall strategy of using terror bombing against civilian targets hasn't changed. The strategy of taking major fortifications by throwing thousands of men at them head-on hasn't changed.",2025-06-05T16:41:04

Russia’s population isn’t that much larger than Japan’s &amp; it’s less than half the size of the Soviet Union’s at its peak. Russia is the largest country in the world if you’re just counting acreage. It’s almost the same size as any two of the next three largest countries combined.

Most of that acreage is barely populated, however.

Canada, China &amp; the US are all pretty close if we’re just talking about physical size. Russia has almost twice as much land as any of those countries. Its population is only 1/10 the size of China’s, however, and only about 40% of America’s. It does have a considerably higher population density than Canada, but Canada is even less hospitable to human life than Russia. 

The idea that Putin has hordes of men to call upon is one of those zombie myths that just won’t die.

The truth is that Russia is rich in land but desperately power as far as people are concerned. Male life expectancy in Russia is about 65-67 years depending on what source you use. The media age in Russia is over 40 &amp; the number of fighting age Russian men is pathetically low. The average age of new Russian contract soldiers is about 50 this year.",2025-06-04T21:35:47

Russia can't keep affording to pay these military salaries and death bonuses to the families. They're promised what is a fortune (to them) to sign up. Why do you think russia leave their dead on the battlefield? No body = no proof = no death bonus. The only reason they want them picked up off the front now is that their own soldiers are falling over the fallen bodies on their way to the front and eventually it's going to cause all sorts of disease as the weather warms up. Also according to zelensky russia are returning their own soldiers bodies to ukraine pretending theyre ukrainian fallen soldiers in military body swaps as another way to get rid of their soldiers. And they're already charging the new recruits big money ""for their equipment"" so they dont get paid what they were promised anyway. And we've probably all seen the despicable way they treat their soldiers.

Ukrainian soldiers are fighting to save their fellow countrymen, their families, and the honour of their land and people. This is why they fight so hard and can defend against these seemingly unlrelenting meat waves of mostly low educated rural russians who did not think they were signing up for the brutality they got, but have shown themselves to be capable of evil actions when tasked to it and would rather 'off' themselves than surrender, because their own commander would do it to them if they retreated anyway.",2025-06-04T20:43:01

When we talk about the economy we don't talk about what regular people have in their pocket, but about the country's budget. For ussr(just like for russia now) gas and oil were main sources of income into budget.

Latest update by Prune60 on their NWF. Their sum liquid assets dropped from 8,2 trillion rubles at the start of the war to 2,8 trillion rubles at 31st of last May. 

That only tells half the story though as their reserves in dollars, Japanese yen and euro's have disappeared. What they have left are yuan and gold. The gold is in there for a value that likely doesn't correspond with reality as they have trouble selling it off.

Another thing to consider is that Russia always has a huge end-of-the-year decrease in the NWF as they pay for stuff. Last year it dropped near 2 trillion at 31-12.

The burden on society is largely seen as one of the things that caused the soviet unions authoritarian regime to collapse. Imagine now, when Russia has less than half the population the soviet union did, now there are 100's of thousands of mangled and wounded men coming from an unjustified war of genocidal conquest that will be a humiliating defeat. Russia is going to get weighed down to death. Roughly 30x the casualties with .5 the population so 60x the problem you had after the afghan war. And this is still going. Thats if Russia stopped now. Meanwhile in all of the territories east of the Ural mountains in that vast space you use to claim you are the largest country, you have around 6 million poor and mistreated minorities with scattered ethnic russian who were moved there during the soviet days.

The point was not WW2, GDP. It was just, that's just how it is in war, when you mobilise your entire economy, you mobilise your entire economy, and that leads to about 30-40%.

""Russia literally announced their plan to take over Ukraine. “3 days to Kyiv” was literally their slogan. So why wouldn’t they spend more money to reach that goal?""

Well why do that? 7% is working in Putin's eyes. So why increase it when you're going to win?

There's also a political and economic ramifications that come with that, and I can't asked to list them all, basically:

International isolation  
Much stronger response from the West  
Russian economy goes down a lot quicker  
Very few people in Russia support such a mobilisation  
And it would only harden Ukrainian resistance against Russia  
As well as also giving away to the Russians that it's not an SVO.

""Also….do you actually watch russian channels? Where are you getting your information from?""

Purely from just assuming.

Any country can go to war economy, anyone, it's not hard, you just spend all your money on war. So, Russia's spending about 6.143% being precise, and that is two times what Ukraine is spending on her defence, which Ukraine is spending about 70 billion dollars a year on her defence, which is 37% of her economy.

Russia is at 6.143,

1. How is the 7% working? Their original goal wasnt met and they had trouble along the way. Russia is having trouble maintaining the territory they’re occupying, not to mention gaining any new territory. That was never the goal…the goal was to occupy the majority of Ukraine and specifically take over the Ukrainian government…again “Kyiv in 3 days” rhetoric that was all over Russian news during the outbreak of the war. So there goes your argument of “why spend more than they need to”. The support for the war in Russia is dwindling bc it's impacting their economy, international standing of their citizens, and costing lives. Estimated 1M lives. And you’re saying that Russia doesn't need to end the war on their end? Lol

2. Britain WW2 spending example doesn’t make sense. Ok it was 30% of their GDP. What did they spend it on? The majority was on land-lease where uk got weapons from other countries like the US. Russia has a limited amount of allies that would make the same deal with them. So even if they wanted to mobilize their economy, they would be limited in effective ways to do so. Developing your own weapons takes time and resources. 

3. Same point of “if the could they would” argument. Your list of political ramifications may be true for using nuclear weapons, but not much more. What Russians are doing in Ukraine is genocide. They’re raping, pillaging and murdering indiscriminately and quite frankly the political ramifications are limited.

4. “Giving away to Russians this is not a SVO” lol this is how I know you don't understand anything about russia. Russians will believe what they’re told to believe. Even if they know better, they don't care. “Very few people support such a mobilization “  Exactly. You can’t just spend more money, you need a way to do so. 

[Here is an article to help you understand the toll of war](https://apple.news/Ay9qqo7yEQwiPehom4mErMQ)

Honestly I have such a hard time understanding where you’re coming from. Your stance and arguments are not logical and even a bit of critical thought would unravel them. Taking 1 data point (from the 1940s) and surrounding an argument around that is absurd. 

And to use that “logic” as to why “Russia would win this war if they wanted” and imply that help from the West would be useless. Dude Russia wants to win….that’s the whole point. Do you not see how nonsensical you are? Btw that’s why you’re getting downvoted….what you’re saying is nonsense",2025-06-04T19:37:46

My logic is:

Russia has resources, therefore, Russia could go to a war economy, and that, would not be good for Ukraine, and that's why the West is scared of escalation.

I do not get why that's confusing. 

""How is the 7% working?""

***Putin*** thinks it is. Keyword, ***Putin*** thinks it is.

""And you’re saying that Russia doesn't need to end the war on their end?""

I have never brought that up as a piece of the argument I'm making because it's completely redundant to my point. The war does need to end with Russia leaving, but that does not correlate to me saying, Russia could go to a war economy and that's why the West is scared of them.

""That was never the goal…the goal was to occupy the majority of Ukraine and specifically take over the Ukrainian government…again “Kyiv in 3 days” rhetoric that was all over Russian news during the outbreak of the war. So there goes your argument of “why spend more than they need to”. The support for the war in Russia is dwindling bc it's impacting their economy, international standing of their citizens, and costing lives. Estimated 1M lives""

Putin thinks he's at war with NATO, so, of course it's going to be slow, in his eyes, that's obvious. He thinks he's at war with NATO, so if he can beat Ukraine, he can claim Russia can beat NATO.

""Britain WW2 spending example doesn’t make sense. Ok it was 30% of their GDP. What did they spend it on?""

Their defence.

""The majority was on land-lease where uk got weapons from other countries like the US.""

A good chunk of that was spent on lend lease, but the majority of it was spent on Britain's defence.

""Russia has a limited amount of allies that would make the same deal with them.""

It doesn't matter how many do it, if a nation decides that they want to make an ammunition factory in Russia, then that ammunition factory is going to happen. It would be very useful for Russia because they wouldn't need to then expand their already existing ammunition factories.

""So even if they wanted to mobilize their economy, they would be limited in effective ways to do so. Developing your own weapons takes time and resources.""

Yes that is true, but a war economy allows that to happen a lot quicker.

To give an example, at the beginning of WW2, some nations used Bi-planes, by 1945, most nations were transitioning to jet planes. 

""Same point of “if the could they would” argument. Your list of political ramifications may be true for using nuclear weapons, but not much more. What Russians are doing in Ukraine is genocide. They’re raping, pillaging and murdering indiscriminately and quite frankly the political ramifications are limited.""

2.

We could not supply enough if we tried, short of going to a war economy. This is why escalation is such a big thing. It's not the nukes we're scared of, it's the fact that Russia hasn't fully mobilised that scares us.

Spending more, allows you to expand your already existing industry, and if you are a major country, like China, the United States or Russia, you can invest in industry that you do not have to then build enough of what you need.

Spending more, is literally why Russia is making more tanks, and more Soviet shells, and more Soviet stuff.

I don't know. The support prior to the war was pretty limited and Ukraine held against Russia at it's best. In like 2-3 months the entire northern front collapsed. Russia has had a hell of a time taking big cities. Mariupol for example. Hell Russia didn't even take Kharkiv which was 30-40 miles from Russia's border in north eastern Ukraine. 

The point being the west's support was much less of a factor during the first 6 months of the war, because it takes time to organize and deliver and agree one what should be given.

I started writing a story more than a decade ago which included the same scenario. Ryan McBeth wrote about almost this exact scenario in his recent book, detailing how vulnerable military assets are within the borders of a country. Both the UK and the US have experienced suspicious drone activity, either attacking infrastructure or (potentially/alleged) sabotaging commercial travel. Over the last few years Finland, Sweden and Norway have all experienced similar threats to installations.

None of this should be a surprise to anyone, and the fact our governments have been caught with their pants down should lead to a thorough spanking.

I'm not claiming no one in our governments/military had the common-sense to see this coming, or that they lacked the required imagination to be able to predict it, but clearly there has been some kind of lack of foresight/action here. Someone dropped the ball, and whether that's in the imagination stage, the assessment stage, or the development stage, those involved should all be embarrassed.

And I'm fully with you, OP. If our stupid governments had done what they should have done at the start, this would have been over within a few months, and it wouldn't have reached this point. Instead, they forgot the phrase ""Necessity is the mother of invention"" and they forgot our own history in which we made remarkable developments during WW2.

Our nations allowed this to continue, and this is the result. Our arrogant leaders underestimated Ukrainian abilities over and over and over again. Our nations have been historically so high on our own romanticized notions of historical heroism, we believe we're better than everyone else and didn't think Ukraine had the same abilities.

(To clarify, I'm speaking of those in power. I think most citizens of our nations fully respect Ukrainian ingenuity and ability.)

Well, now we're stuck in a difficult place where Ukraine has had no choice but to unleash a Pandora's Box of possibilities.

And now I find myself wondering what else Ukraine has up its sleeve that the rest of the world will be surprised by. Will our leaders finally work out that we should help to end this now with conventional means, or will they again all sit back and deliver piecemeal nonsense, only to be shocked once more when Ukraine releases another ""unboxing"" video?

Sadly, given how stupid so many of those in power are - and have been for a long time - I fully expect them to do nothing again, and for them to be blind sided when Ukraine delivers another means of attack to the world that our so-called ""experts"" didn't have the intellect or imagination to predict.",2025-06-04T09:07:45

But let's also have some understanding for Ukrainians. I think some anger towards the situation is justified. They are living in war, they are losing relatives. And of course if you then see your allies dragging their feet, it would make you angry. And especially now that Trump is providing even less aid than Biden.

Ukrainians have had to sacrifice so much. But I've also seen many messages of gratefulness for the assistance they DID get in this sub.

I would very much like our leaders to do more. I've even been sending messages to the EU about it. But I think the whole debt problem in Europe is part of the issue. 

Regardless, I understand the frustration and it's clear to see it's directed at our leaders, not our people. So let's not get our feelings hurt by someone venting their justified frustration. How would you feel if you were a Ukrainian?

Also: the aid is not charity. I honesty believe Ukraine's fighting is actually protecting Europe too. It's clear that Putin wants to restore the Russian empire and maybe take a bit more for good measure. So we should try to support Ukraine as much as we can.

It would be nice to believe that it's simply a matter of American leadership trying to maintain a neutral position as negotiator. But we don't see those same denials coming out of the whitehouse after russian attacks.

Some parties are constantly pushing for more support, while others want to put an lower budget on all foreign support. I don't think the parties that want to support Ukraine have miscalculated anything. As they have been saying from the start that Ukraine can win.

Now regarding the silence, I've noticed this too. I cannot talk for the US, but my suspicion is in the EU it's due to deescalation.

Plenty of us were screaming that Putin's nuclear threats 100% needed to be treated as a bluff. The day the Kharkiv offensive took place was the day the west should have flooded Ukraine with weapons to push the russians out once and for good. Instead, after the awe was over, the fear of eSCaLaTioN crept back. Those of us who were screaming for more, Zelensky included, were told repeatedly that the drip feeding policy was 100% fine and by doing this we are ""keeping the conflict contained so we do not have to send out children to die one day in the future"".

Except...that entire drip feed policy has crept us closer than ever to a world-wide conflict. I 100% believe that had Biden and his team shown some actual muscle and provided the FULL support Ukraine needed, the Dems could have used that as a launching pad for Harris to win the presidency. What a wave of patriotism that would be; finally the bad red army has been defeated, shamed and never allowed to invade another country again. All for pennies on the dollar, *not a single American soldier's life lost*, all handed on a silver platter. But now, we are stuck with a POTUS that has shit all over literally every single ally the USA has built over the past century, and he's not done yet. A weakened NATO that looks more fragile than ever where it seems like a given that the US will NOT come to the aid if called upon. The stability and leadership the USA has provided to the Western world is cracking and one day, some country somewhere will start some shit that will drag us all in, mark my words. What's that, talks of taking over Greenland or even f'ing Canada? I can't imagine Harris doing something like that. If only she had won, right?

Ukraine being given what they asked for, when the asked for it, being allowed to use it how they see fit would have resulted in conventional war staying exactly that way; conventional. Instead, we now get to witness the birth of the drone era of war in which the 2 countries that are by far the most advanced in that kind of warfare, get to test it in true battlefield scenarios. This isn't US drones chasing cavemen in mountains where 20 operators sit in a room and peacefully sip coffee while they launch attacks at a wedding. This is the future of war, of terrorism, on display and once again we can thank the policy of eSCaLaTioN management for allowing this kind of progress to be made. 

What I have learned is that if a nuclear-armed country wants nuclear proliferation to be a thing, you'd better step the fuck up and help other countries who have abided by your policy (in this case, Ukraine) of disarming and help them when they need it. And it should be done in such a way that other countries watch what happens and think twice before waving their own nukes around and invading another. A quick swift victory against the russians would have sent a strong message to China to think twice about about attacking Taiwan, lest you feel the swift axe of the west. Instead...it's a ticking time bomb and once again with Trump in power, it's not certain that the USA will come to Taiwan's rescue.

After living in the aftermath of this attack on russia's nuclear bomber fleet, we can now use the power of hindsight to see just how the dominos have fallen ever since escalation management has led us to this stage. The frustrating part is that this was all entirely preventable, predictable, and those in power simply kept kicking the can down the road. The desire to keep your children and their children out of conflict, is in fact turned upside down, and for many it seems closer than ever. Especially for those that live within the sphere of American imperialist ambitions, and a fractured NATO alliance, thanks to a president who is very clearly on the Orc's side. One who would likely not be power right now had his predecessor shown more courage in the face of threats and shown his people that his side was worthy of their vote by defeating their eternal enemy, all for pennies on the dollar.",2025-06-04T19:32:47

This is the lesson, again, that we all should finally fucking learn. 


НІХТО КРІМ НАС.


We should never expect anyone to help us work anything, even if their own survival depends on our success. 


We shouldn't expect anyone to give us anything for free or even sell us anything when they smell the profit.


And we shouldn't forget any deeds - good or bad - that were done when we were in need. 


Western allies value words and their own lives very much. We in Ukraine know the true price of human life - it is much less that western people pretend it to be. And we know the price of words, precisely, because words worth nothing. 


We can only trust the actions, and there were very few actions compared to a stockpile of words. And we found some friends along the way, who share our blood. I mean people, individuals, not the amorphous 'nation'. Right people, in the wrong places, can change the world. 


So, value those who deserves it and know the worth of those who does not deserve it. ",2025-06-04T13:36:49

There is a balance to be reached in communication about this. I was talking and writing about it with friends and colleagues. So it's not like it's been unseen.  

But we also know that after every succesful operation vs high value military target, ruzzians target civilians en masse. So even though it's tempting to play on our noses towards ruzzia, it is not our place to do so. It'd be like a chick on the sidelines of a brawl egging the opponent on. 

One thing that is true - we're again shockingly surprised and unprepared to this ""development"". Hats off to AFU&amp;SBU on execution but the idea? How tf are we shocked, again?     
Since this year we've even changed the law to enforce authorizing all drone flights. There's a new fine and everything.  Our flight agency has the tool to set our drone's ass down or to return to point of start at moment's notice. But I've noticed multiple times in last weeks  that people fly over restricted zones and they don't call it in in Drone Tower and... nothing. Maybe someone seeks  the fine, but that's just silly afterthought that ought to be nothing more than deterrent. The real response should be forcing a landing, and then if you can't do that - that's when you know you're dealing with imminent danger. 

  
This  is one of the ways Ukrainians are helping to keep us safe - we get to adjust to these innovations without actively fighting a war which among other things makes command more rigid.  

PS.: as a lazy motherfucker myself, I've got to wonder: what do you think your post achieves? I spend non trivial amount of time arguing against YOUR POINTS but with people who are opposed to our help to Ukraine.

2. Russia targets civilians in Ukraine systematically. The fact that you’ve convinced yourself Russia acts in a retaliatory manner is aberration of informational space and a cognitive error. Every day Russia destroys houses and apartments with KABs, missiles and drones. You just cherry pick attacks to fit your narrative.
3. As a Ukrainian civilian I say target me instead of my military all day and all night long! My life is worth a lot less than a life of a trained, experienced soldier. The fact that the enemy is mainly focusing on terror tactics tells you all you need to know about state of affairs of the Russian military. The thing is, when you’re holding someone’s head underwater, they’ll often bite and claw at you, forgoing all rules of engagement. The point is to keep holding them under no matter what.

For the EU, it just means that bragging about UA's success brings nothing to the help UA. Bragging would would feed the narrative of Putin that NATO wants to attack RU.

From what I see here in French media, the mood is quite celebratory and praising Ukraine's ingenuity.

[See for yourself!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXSRZf1HMW8) (you can activate the auto-translation if needed)

Although there is the expected whining from Philipot, one of the far-right Putin sock-puppets.

I share your frustration. I'm even in favor of Ukraine getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it may be. I guess it's because I see a reflection of our suffering during WWII in your current suffering. It made us go ""never again"", getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it was at the time, and pursuing a strategy of military autonomy up to this day, as controversial as it also has been.

That being said, I don't like being lumped together with the US under the umbrella term of ""The West"", and drawing blanket statement about us from it. Especially now that it's so fractured, with Trump saying things like ""The EU was created to screw over the US"", wanting to seize Canada and Greenland, it seems the US caught the fascist disease, like Russia.

And for all that this term of ""The West"" is worth, Ukraine is now part of it, isn't it? Or at least part of the EU bloc as a Candidate country, which is more important than many realise. Ukraine's genius hasn't been only in the battlefield, but also in the political sphere. The Zelensky government has positioned Ukraine, not as a lesser country begging for missiles and external help, but as a hero of Europe, a leader and defender. Seemingly with the complicity and support of many EU leaders. Pretty much everyone in Europe now knows the motto of ""Slava Ukraini! Heroim Slava!"" This is rooted in the true glory of Ukraine, but I don't think it spread this far just by accident. Some even say that Ukraine is now the new leader of the ""Free World"", and in heart I agree.

As cruel as it may be in this cruel world, a ""self-actualised"" Ukraine doesn't get to complain about ""the West"". You are part of the West now, you are now the ""France of the East"", you are a leader who has to play with the hand you have been dealt with, we Europeans are the imperfect hand you have been given, but at least it's not ""you have no cards"" as the other would say.

We Europeans believed we achieved forever peace and mothballed our military. We were caught with our pants down. On the plus side, now that we are rearming, we can invest heavily in drone warfare just like Ukraine, you can guide us in that, we can together create the EU army of the future.

We have failed to provide you with enough weapons, but in many cases it wasn't that we were sitting on big stockpiles refusing to give it away, we didn't have much really.

But at least we have a lot of money lol, we've invested a lot of money in keeping Ukraine up and working, and in your military, to develop your own weapons, our weapons for the future.

As far as the EU is concerned, we depend on you as much as you depend on us. We are not the West as opposed to Ukraine. We are in this together. Your victories are our victories. If they are causing ""deep shock"" for the world, good. We are Europe, Europa Universalis. Apparently we've been too nice and the world has forgotten the monster we were.

We are not afraid of nukes in the Pentagon. We know that we(NATO) would survive the exchange and Russia would not. By military definition Russia cannot ""win"" with nukes while we will ""survive"" Russian nukes. 

Trump is terrified of nuclear weapons because he is an idiot who cannot understand them and is to arrogant to ask those of us that do.

The American people in general are more like European teenagers but with less intelligence. For all of Americas accomplishments they have never really been under real stress. They don't get really exposed to war or privation. They don't really suffer poverty(American poverty is wealth in the rest of the world). In general, their lives are to good to make them fight for anything with any real risk to their lives.

As to governments... it's.. complicated.   
In every metric it is better to help Ukraine for the western world.. but there is also a few with real fear of Ukraine too at the heights of power. Ukraine could easily become Russia 2.0 in these peoples minds. Even if the concept is absurd to a Ukrainian the fear of a powerful unified nation with a modern army and a different way of thinking skews things. Then there is also the might makes right crowd that stupidly agrees with the Russian way of doing things.

The reason everybody is silent is because Ukraine have fundamentally changed the nature of warfare with this attack. They've demonstrated that no part of the world is safe from this new form of hybrid warfare and that will shake the core of the great powers. 
The second and related reason is the idea of mutually assured destruction. It relies on the fact that nuclear armed nations have the capacity to annihilate each other if a nuclear war were to start. This extends not only to nations nuclear arsenals, but also their defence against the nuclear arsenal of another nation. If you can demonstrate that you can defend yourself against a nuclear attack from another nation or you can pre-emptively cripple your adversaries arsenal before they're able to launch a strike it paradoxically moves the entire world closer to that precipice. Ukraine directly attacking the delivery systems of Russia's nuclear arsenal shows that not only their but also every nuclear armed nations arsenal is now vulnerable to relatively cheap and widely available weapons that smaller nations and even some terrorist groups are fully capable of utilising against them.

I’d argue the west is involved. Ukraine did this yes, but the logistics involved likely had european/american help here.

1. I’m not taking away from Ukraine, I believe we’re simply supplying/assisting and training.

2. I really don’t like Trump and i’m livid at how he treated Zelensky. But isn’t the timing strange? Ukraine was likely pressured as we all witnessed, to be quiet and to not pull off any further substantial attacks. Especially ones that would seek to humiliate Putin which Ukraine is so damn good at. Trump wanted to be in full control of anything that might threaten peace talks.
However after Ukraine signed the minerals deal and did all that Trump said, it became clear to Trump that Russia was the only one not playing ball. Something we all knew but he didn’t because he’s an idiot. 

I think because of this, Trump has given Ukraine the go ahead to start biting back again to force Putin to the table seriously. The issue is that Putin doesn’t want to legitimize Zelensky. He has paraded him on Russian media as a terrorist and an illigitimate leader. He also sees Zelensky as below him with no real power and therefore not his equal. He wants to discuss these talks with Trump and only Trump. If Zelensky and Putin are to be in the same room it would be with Trump. Putin is evil and very cunning.

The timings of the attack right before the 2nd round of talks is telling though. Especially since Russia snubbed the first round. They got a taste of their own medicine. You want strength and cunning power? Ukraine can rise to the occassion.

Lastly, this is just an opinion based on my observations. I say that because it is highly possible Ukraine just said “F this, Trump is getting us nowhere and it’s making things worse”. I just know that Zelensky has countless times put his own percieved image on the line for the US and Europe etc to politically/diplomatically get things done by the book so we are all kept on the right side of history and not stooping to Russia’s level of degenerecy, showing once again that our system of life is far superior despite it’s failings.

I just think the finesse and sophistication of getting these drones and such smuggled into Russia via other countries has likely been done with the help of other nations. 

I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch to believe that. Britian for example has been involved in trainning up Ukrainian saboteurs previously.

Ukraine had to be trainned from the ground up. The country went from civillians making molitovs in the streets to launching himars and naval drones at airbases, oil and weapons depots and attack boats and blowing up bridges. They didn’t just sprout a plethora of skill and capability from nowhere with a mostly civillian army.

They have so much experience and information they can teach western militaries in terms of real experience, but trainning and critical assistance has absolutely been there for this whole war. Our countries in the west are seriously threatened by Russia’s invasion, hense why we’re balls deep involved.",2025-06-04T11:03:30

This makes the least sense. Ukraine as a former member of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union with a huge Russian speaking population is almost uniquely qualified to infiltrate Russia. I can't think of literally anything that foreign intelligence services could teach them. Syrskyi is a graduate of the Moscow Higher Combined Arms Command School and I'm pretty sure there are lots of KGB trained officers in the GUR that know everything about how the FSB works. They probably bunked in the same dorm with today's FSB top rank in the academy.",2025-06-04T11:18:00
1l302um,"What’s with the silence, West?",jesterboyd,1415,2025-06-04T08:12:58,Kyle-SB,1,"So you think sweet talking in Russian is how smuggling in weaponised drones in the middle of a very serious war is all it takes? Come on dude.

If you can’t think of anything foreign intelligence can teach them you’re slightly overestimating what Ukraine has accomplished on their own. Like I said they didn’t have much before western involvement and couldn’t have done this without their weapons and trainning. 

Knowing about the KGB is helpful but trying to apply these sophisticated attacks in the middle of a battlefield is extremely complex and requires alot of moving parts to go right to get done. Ukraine wouldn’t be able to shift that gear into Russia over their own border would they? So they’d need to do it via other countries wouldn’t they? Which would involve other countries assitance wouldn’t it?

Remember, Ukraine is using drones and espionage because it doesn't have to ability to hit Russia where it hurts otherwise. 

Russia can just bomb them, Ukraine can't, and this is the opposite against NATO, NATO wouldn't be worried to do this, but everyone against NATO will be.

Being a westerner I also am dismayed at the hypocrisies we see. And I am sure many see the same thing.  I can only rationalise this in the idea of 'know your enemy' which the west has had as a comfortable status quo, or at least we have fooled ourselves into thinking so.  Thus it has been since sometime after the end of WW2 that the ruzzians(then USSR) have become the enemy and with time we thought we knew them and how to deal with them.  This was a sort of comfort at the highest levels I suppose.  I am guessing that this false comfort has guided the policies of at least the most powerful western nations up until June 1 this year.  They feared a dissolution of ruzzia would create a plethora of unknown enemies and did everything to aid the ruzzians just enough to avoid the scenario, which meant in your case aiding you just enough not to tip ruzzia into dissolution.  I hate this situation.  I say ruzzia has brought it on themselves so I welcome the events of June 1 and it is time for a new world order with Ukraine as a democratic nation that chooses it's own path, hopefully still with the western nations for the coming geopolitical storm.

After WWII the US has fought (and lost) more wars than it “won”. Defined front lines became obscure guerrilla war encounters. Improvised explosives can stop a well equipped army from advancing; un-uniformed combatants in unfamiliar terrain and cultural differences made it difficult and even impossible to gain the “hearts and minds” required to “win” a war.

Ukraine has shown us that inexpensive drones can be developed and used as a significant/effective weapon. This is a terrifying prospect to nations that have put all their efforts ($$$) into large and expensive aircraft/artillery/tanks. A simple drone, built by a high school student, can inflict damage to multi billion dollar assets behind the lines in secure storage.
