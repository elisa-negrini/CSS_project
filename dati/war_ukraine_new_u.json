I read this week about Ukrainian units having a lot of success here by using drone dropped caltrops (an ancient anti cavalry defensive tool that is essentially spiked metal twisted up). The caltrops pierce the wheels of the motorbikes and ATVs that Russia has been increasingly using for assaults, rendering them useless. They claimed to have achieved a 66:1 casualty ratio between Russian and Ukrainian troops here, which sounds unbelievably high.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbvlbp7ik8gf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2b2449a8d0458ddc7c3460ec22768163da1de\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtmuzfqik8gf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f89fb594646477ffa189eeec533cbb3e26f732\n\n* Russians expanded the grey zone west of Chasiv Yar, now covering the whole city, though I don't consider a city lost until it is entirely red. Still, that seems like it will happen any week now. Ukraine has fought long and hard for this city, and deserves a lot of credit for how long they have held the Russians here, just a few miles away from Bakhmut.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbkqt19jk8gf1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93327c015e2fdaa4a13cb1bd10f8a6eb9063fcfc\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf53t5pjk8gf1.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8686ab7ee5a499ef1a47ba560528798edde251ab\n\n* More Russian advances between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and it seems at least one Russian assault group made it into the town of Pokrovsk itself before being driven out.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmkcc0bkk8gf1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929b8b2d8758a2bfad4d6ce82478a6fcae6aa663\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqjib2qkk8gf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d0cb0b35cece561a2f650949744061dfe78c1d\n\n* Russians advanced here in three different places, though none of them are particularly large advances. This is tough defensive territory because there are no significant towns between Huliapole and Velykomykhailivka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump said that he is shortening the previous 50 days he had given Putin to come to the table, though he didn't exactly specify the time period (I saw 12 days being mentioned so I put that in the title). Still, he has been more and more critical of Putin and has repeated that he is the one who is blocking peace. He also threatened India with secondary tariffs if they don't stop buying Russian oil, which is very significant since India has been one of the biggest funders of Russia's war through these continued purchases. Trump and Modi have been very close in the past, so I was surprised to see him go as hard on them as he is, but I'm glad someone is finally trying to hold India to account for how much money they have supplied Putin with. India, as they love to do, is whining and trying to act like this is unreasonable, but what is really unreasonable is continuing to buy oil from a country that is killing thousands and thousands of people in an illegal and unjustified war of aggression. India is now being forced to take a side, and I don't see them ultimately siding with China and Russia here.\n* Under strong international and domestic pressure, Ukraine's parliament signed a law repealing the attempted gutting of neutrality for anti-corruption organizations. I'm still rather confused as to why anyone attempted this in the first place or thought they would get away with it, this whole thing seems like a big self-own from Zelensky, but I understand that he is under a lot of pressure from many different sides, and probably just made a bad call. Either way, it's good that they were forced to quickly recognize the error of their ways and repeal the law.\n* Ukrainian hackers hit major Russian airline Aeroflot with a massive cyberattack that halted the airline's operations and leaked tons of important documents. Russian media is now saying it may take as many as 6 months for them to fully restore their operations. Anything that causes disruptions of economic activity in Russia is very useful.\n* The Russian economy continues to face significant headwinds, as the Russian Central Bank runs out of tools they can use to continue their economic shell game where they move different debts around in order to keep the Russian economy moving. Non-military companies are facing increasingly dire economic outlooks, and British and European sanctions and aggressive enforcement against the Russian shadow tanker fleet are limiting their options for how they can sell their oil above the EU-imposed price cap. I don't expect anything to collapse overnight, but as I've said before, I believe that by the end of this year or the first half of next year, their ability to continue funding the war at the current level will be severely degraded.\n* Several major European governments are preparing to request billions of dollars in loans from the EU to purchase military equipment for themselves and for Ukraine under the new Security Assistance Facility for Europe program. Ukraine currently has tens of billions of dollars worth of military production sitting idle due to a lack of funds. If their military industrial complex was fully funded, they would be in a vastly better position, and it does look like that may happen relatively soon.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,432 (+35)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,082 (+7)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,076 (+5)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+0)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+0)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 163 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,493 (+61)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,232 (+6)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,430 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1053 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 611 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of greater overall Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russians, though it's important to note that in the most crucial categories of tanks and IFVs, Ukraine is very slightly below Russia, and many of Ukraine's vehicle losses are coming from easily replaced IMVs.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Specifically he keeps saying how there have been violent repressions against ethnic Russians in Ukraine since the Maidan. For context I'm Bulgarian.\n\nI've tried looking up information about these alleged repressions and all I've found is articles from Russian media outlets which instinctively makes me think this is just Russian state propaganda to justify the funding of the Donbas separatists and the subsequent invasion. I want to know if there's any amount of truth to this or if my dad's brain is just cooked. He keeps comparing it to our situation with Macedonia and I just don't want to argue with him for the billionth time.",

Like, you guys used to have russian language and literature classes at school just a few decades ago, didn’t you? And russia has a habit of using those kind of “russian culture lovers clubs/classes” as its soft power, pushing imperialistic narratives in-between the lines.\n\nI’ve also heard those narratives aren’t tolerated in Bulgaria these days and that’s really a big step. But that doesn’t cancel out the two older generations that have already soaked in the narrative and might push it upon younger people who avoided the Soviet period.\n\nHonestly, I believe most people around 40 or older aren’t prone to changing their mind, so there might be nothing to be done. Just keep on educating yourself and researching the topics, reach out in this community if you have any doubts.\n\nTo answer your question: no, there have been no violent oppressions. In-between 2014 and 2022 (8 years in the war on the eastern front) Ukraine has finally removed russian language’s status of one of the official ones in the country and it finally stopped being taught in schools. Those kinda laws appeared. But that barely affected the lives of russian-speaking citizens and ethnic russians. That I can tell and actually show you first hand :)\n\nSo in case you want to change your dad’s mind, I invite you and him to come to Ukraine.

Their testimony in the Hague helped in the prosecution of Putin for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  If Putin really is the good guy how come he's a war criminal?\n\nThe \"Little Green Men\" were ready because for years they were actively involved in false flag attacks on civilians in the Donbas.   Take for example the testimony of Igor Salikov, an officer of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU).\n\n[https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/](https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/24/wagner-defector-exposes-russias-donbas-ruse-false-flag-ops-in-bombshell-interview/)\n\n&gt;Having been involved in Russia’s war against Ukraine since 2014, Salikov witnessed Russia’s covert takeover and hybrid warfare in eastern Ukraine. In a bombshell interview with with founder Vladimir Osechkin, he tells how chief puppetmaster Vladislav Surkov carefully constructed the fiction of a “Donbas uprising,” how he and other Russian proxies were allowed to use only legacy Soviet equipment to avoid giving Russia away, and how Russia conducted shelled its own territory to frame Ukraine, constructing the Big Lie of a “Donbas genocide.” \n\nBefore the war, the number of civilian deaths in the Donbas was declining and nothing like what it now is due to Putin's blatant shameless war of aggression.\n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293409/civilian-deaths-related-to-russia-ukraine-conflict/)\n\n&gt;Prior to the war, fighting took place in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and separatist forces supported by the Russian government. Over the course of 2021, 25 conflict-related deaths were recorded in Ukraine. Between April 14 and December 31, 2014, the number of killed civilians exceeded 2,084. These include 298 victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) which was shot down in July 2014.\n\nI'm guessing your dad doesn't care about the 298 civilians killed when a commercial plane was shot down by the DPR in July 2014.   They don't count because they're not 'ethnic Russians'.\n\nIf Putin cared a jot about civilian deaths would he now be levelling villages, towns and cities across Ukraine?  Even Trump has admitted Putin's response to his peace talks is to launch mass attacks against civilians night after night after night.",

As a matter of fact, before Maidan, in 2012, pro-Russian politicians brought to power by the Kremlin passed the infamous \"Kivalov-Kolesnichenko\" law, which heavily expanded \"regional\" languages and gave more power to the Russian language. It pretty much allowed regional languages to be used as official language if more than 10% of the region spoke the language. It was revoked in 2014. The biggest thing that really changed for an average person after it was revoked was that any official forms or documents would have to be completed in the national language, Ukrainian. Which was the case anyway before 2012. Documents were done in two languages anyway - Ukrainian and Russian. Not just in the region, but throughout Ukraine. \n\nIt affected nothing else pretty much. Russian books weren't banner, Russian TV was still available via cable or antennas if the coverage was there, and so on. \n\nWho really suffered in Ukraine for DECADES are people choosing to speak Ukrainian in urban areas, heavily Russified over the Soviet period. Especially in the east, in places like Donbas. People would be ridiculed and mocked. I had a colleague like that in Donetsk. She moved from Lviv with her husband for work and spoke Ukrainian her whole life. Now, the immediate circle was great, as everyone was more or less educated and a decent human being. But I'd still catch people \"from the outside\" throwing glances at her once they heard her speak. She'd often be treated with dumb \"bandera\" jokes or other stupid comments. She often spoke about harassment and bullying. \n\nAs a mirror example, her husband was a Russian speaker who grew up in Lviv, but never really felt oppressed. \n\nEverything else is manufactured propaganda. Russians are good at playing the victim card and too many people buy into that shit. Remind your dad that Hitler used the same type of excuse to start WWII. \"Defending ethnic ABC\\_XYZ\" and all that bullshit is nothing new.",

So she kept spreading nonsence and beleived in what was convinient for her to keep in touch with her Russian friends. We just cut all communication with her after we were forced to leave our home in 2022 while she was preaching by the phone that Russians are good, they don't bomb our cities and came to \"liberate\" us. You can't communicate with a lunatic. P.S. I was born in Russia so I surely would have experience supposed \"repressions\" against Russians if they were real. They are not. If anything, under Russian occupation (including Soviet occupation) Ukrainians were always persecuted in Ukraine for their ethinicity just for refusing to accept Russian identity. In Donbass region, where I lived, even after the fall of the Soviet Union persecution of Ukrainian identity was encouraged by local criminal authorities that had close connections with Russia.",

I don’t know why or what problem fyroms have with Bulgaria, I can see how your dad thinks that communism “created” them, the same way ruzzian ppl believe Ukrainians were created by communism. I would maybe lay into the fact that the fyrmaceos are taking two people’s cultures. While Ukraine is really the predecessor to the god forsaken ruzzian people. With Volodymyr in Kyiv and his three sons fighting for Kyiv and starting new settlements. So maybe a stretch you could say which is true for Ukrainians is that russians want Ukrainian history while Ukrainians don’t want their name to be linked to the atrocities of russia.

If your dad was working in the 80s, had active social life, you kids were young - and now he’s retired, social life is just hanging out with other old folks and watching tv/reading facebook… sure the 80s was better, so it’s easy to think it was because of communism. Being in the Soviet sphere but on the periphery was also way better than being in Russia itself. I mean compare growing up in Sofia in the 1960s or 70s vs let’s say Chelyabinsk (same size city in Russia) at the same time, Sofia seems like paradise by comparison. Add to that Russians are still seen in very positive light in Bulgaria because of the liberation from the Turks, so the idea of them conquering anyone causes a lot of cognitive dissonance there in particular\n\nThe main bit of advice I have is just watch “Servant of the People” with him over some rakiya. It has Zelensky playing the main character, it’s hilarious (if you grew up in old soviet republic) and it’s in Russian. Also was super popular show on Ukrainian TV in 2015-2016. So any kind of “Russians are oppressed” story is kinda obvious bs just from that\n\nP.S. I say the show is in Russian but that’s not entirely true, it goes back and forth sometimes so quickly you can miss it. From what I remember in the opening scene Zelensky (playing a school teacher) is talking to the kids in his class in Russian, one of the kids asks a question in Ukrainian and he answers in Ukrainian, then continues in Russian, it’s seamless",

        "body": "From the article: Russia has carried out over 10,000 chemical weapons attacks against Ukrainian forces since the start of its full-scale invasion, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) reported on July 30.\n\nThe agency said Russian troops have repeatedly used prohibited chemical agents, including K-51, RGR, and RG-VO aerosol grenades loaded with CS (chlorobenzylidene malonitrile) and CN (chloroacetophenone), both banned irritants.\n\nThe use of such agents is prohibited under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which Russia ratified.\n\nThe SBU said the most common method of deployment involves first-person view (FPV) drones dropping chemical munitions directly onto Ukrainian defensive positions.\n\nUpon detonation, these agents cause severe irritation to the eyes and respiratory system, often forcing Ukrainian troops to leave protected positions under active fire.\n\nIn a July 4 report, the Netherlands Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) confirmed that Russia had escalated from deploying riot control agents to using chloropicrin — a chemical capable of killing in confined spaces.\n\nThe U.S. State Department had also raised the alarm in May 2024, citing Russia's use of chloropicrin in Ukraine as one of the reasons behind the imposed sanctions against over 280 Russian individuals and entities.\n\nUkrainian forces previously struggled to identify the specific agents used due to a lack of detection equipment. The documentation of more than 10,000 chemical attacks underscores the scale of the threat.",

During this time, the peninsula has been viewed by much of the world as a “disputed territory” or even a potential bargaining chip in the peace process. However, with the start of the full-scale Russian invasion, it became clear that Crimea serves not only as a military base but also as a platform for committing war crimes, carrying out systematic repressions, and executing strategic manipulations.**\n\n# Crimea as a military launchpad for invasion\n\nSince the beginning of the occupation in 2014, Russia has turned Crimea into a strategic military base. Shortly after its illegal annexation, the peninsula became a key hub for the Russian Black Sea Fleet and a center of regional militarisation: military infrastructure expanded rapidly, with new missile systems, aviation units, air defense systems, and more deployed. According to Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of fall 2019, Russia had stationed 40 tanks, 583 armored vehicles, 162 heavy artillery systems, 122 combat aircraft, 62 helicopters, and 12 multiple rocket launch systems in Crimea. Additionally, 34 Russian warships and seven submarines were already operating in the region.\n\nIt was from occupied Crimea that Russia launched its offensive against southern Ukraine in the early days of the full-scale invasion. The peninsula was used as a launchpad, allowing the Kremlin to coordinate attacks on ground targets, firing missiles at civilian and military sites, and using both aviation and naval forces. After the initial assault has stalled, the peninsula continues to serve as a launch point for strikes on the surrounding Ukrainian regions: Bessarabia, Prychornomoria, Tavria, Pryazovia, Podniprovia and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nRussia uses Crimea actively for several reasons. First, its convenient rail and road connections allow quick delivery of troops, fuel, equipment, and ammunition, which are then moved to the front lines stretching nearby. Second, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, based in Sevastopol after Crimea’s 2014 occupation, uses the peninsula as both a staging area and a launching platform for missile strikes and maritime reconnaissance. Third, Crimea’s proximity to the front makes it a convenient base for launching drones and rockets. Since the distance from Crimea is shorter, missiles reach their targets faster, which also gives the Ukrainian forces less time to react.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvov5e560jff1.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1664efe2b18d71ba0ed47c014ef753ea2bbd4cd\n\n# Deployment of Russia’s military equipment to Crimea\n\nDue to its convenient logistical location, Crimea has become a main route for transporting weapons, troops, and supplies to the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nBefore military equipment is sent to the front, it often needs to be serviced or repaired. For this, Russia has built the necessary infrastructure in Crimea — repair bases, technical stations, and workshops. Old farms, factories, and industrial buildings have been widely repurposed into storage sites for ammunition, fuel, and other military supplies. In 2018, journalists from the Ukrainian media Crimea.Realities discovered abandoned cowsheds in the area. By 2019–2020, a large military facility had already been constructed there — a storage base intended for use in the event of a full-scale war. This is not an isolated example; Russia began constructing such bases long before the full-scale invasion.\n\nAdditionally, the peninsula has become a key center for conducting military exercises, with many military units and barracks built after 2014 to accommodate Russian troops and civilians from Crimea who have been forcibly conscripted into the Russian army. In 2015 alone, two out of six planned dormitories were completed for the 126th Separate Coastal Defense Brigade and the 8th Artillery Regiment of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet to quarter up to 1,800 occupying troops. According to multiple reports, over 10,000 apartments were built between 2014 and 2021 across different parts of the peninsula to house Russian servicemen and their families. In 2023, the Russian government passed a law guaranteeing housing for soldiers fighting in the war against Ukraine. These servicemen were also granted simplified procedures for registering ownership of these homes.\n\n# How Russia violates international treaties on the militarisation of occupied territories\n\nThe militarisation of Crimea clearly shows Russia’s disregard for the safety and well-being of the local population. Many Crimean residents understand that their lives have become hostage to war — the peninsula has been turned into a massive military base, and people are effectively used as a resource to serve the needs of the occupying forces. Moreover, Russian forces deliberately integrate civilian infrastructure into their military strategy, constructing facilities near residential areas to reduce the likelihood of Ukrainian strikes. The coordinator of the Yellow Ribbon resistance movement reported that residents of Sevastopol — the administrative capital and the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet — have repeatedly complained about the construction of military sites close to their homes, significantly increasing the danger for civilians.\n\n***Note: \"Yellow Ribbon\" is a public resistance movement in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, created in April 2022 after the Russian military invasion. The goal of the movement is informational resistance to the Russian occupiers.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lazxkm7e0jff1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1ab98866501cc5b6b595b5f88c29d9533bdbb1\n\nRussia’s military presence on the peninsula also fuels the crackdowns on local activists, public society, and civilians loyal to Ukraine. Faced with the constant threat of forced mobilisation and repression, more than 200,000 residents have been forced to flee as of July 2024, as reported by the Permanent Representative of the President in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This decision requires careful planning, as Russian occupation forces strictly monitor and control departures from the peninsula.\n\n# Illegal mobilisation of Crimeans into the Russian army\n\nForced mobilisation of Crimean residents began immediately after the 2014 occupation of the peninsula, but the most active waves started following the full-scale invasion in 2022. Forcing civilians in occupied territories to serve in the occupying power’s military is a violation of Article 51 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. According to the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people, up to 25,000 draft notices were issued, with 90% of them handed specifically to Crimean Tatars.\n\n***Note: The Mejlis is the sole supreme representative and executive body of the Crimean Tatar people. It was established in 1991.***\n\nMany Crimean residents initially refused to accept Russian citizenship. However, due to severe restrictions, such as denial of access to medical care, education, employment, pensions, and direct threats, they were forced to obtain it. Holding a Russian passport automatically makes every man eligible for military service and, consequently, for mobilisation. Procedural violations often accompany the draft. Military enlistment offices routinely reject medical certificates, while officials often ignore or destroy deferral and exemption documents on the spot. Occupation authorities also dismiss religious beliefs as valid grounds for exemption, despite their prior recognition under Ukrainian law.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ywb4wel0jff1.png?width=1536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5f2ccdc86d41182e916643f495af9f61b3bc2b\n\nOpen sources also report repeated cases of men being detained in the streets directly after work by enlistment officers, often being taken immediately to enlistment offices. Detainees are not informed of their whereabouts or what will happen next; occupying forces instruct them to turn off their phones and deny any contact with their families. Under physical and psychological pressure, many are coerced into signing “voluntary” applications to join the Russian army.\n\nFormer Presidential Representative in Crimea Tamila Tasheva reported that in 2023, approximately 44,500 Crimean residents were conscripted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Others try to avoid the draft by not staying at their registered address, hoping to keep away from the visits of military offices or security agents.\n\nThose who ignore draft notices, avoid military offices, or skip medical check-ups face administrative fines that increase over time. Furthermore, police put such individuals on wanted lists. The occupying authorities track them using phone data, social media activity, and street surveillance. Men who try to leave the peninsula but fall under the mobilisation category are stopped at checkpoints and denied exit. Filing a legal complaint against such persecution is futile — most end up with penalties and forced enlistment anyway.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Join us tomorrow for Part 2, about human rights violations and the persecution of Crimean Tatars.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe 1251st day of a ten-year invasion that has been going on for centuries.\n\nOne day closer to victory.\n\n# 🇺🇦 HEROIAM SLAVA! 🇺🇦\n\n",

That’s the entire reason they left.\n\nSo they’re essentially protesting defensive tech that’s literally saving lives in Ukraine.\n\nHere’s the part that really gets me. They didn’t pull their music from Yandex Music. That’s Russia’s main streaming platform, and it’s deeply tied to the Russian state. It censors content, serves propaganda, and directly benefits the country that’s bombing Ukraine.\n\nSo to break this down clearly:\n\t•\tThey say they oppose war.\n\t•\tThey protest a company helping Ukraine survive.\n\t•\tThey leave their music available in Russia, on a platform used by the regime that invaded.\n\nSome Ukrainians and others have started commenting on their Instagram post to call this out. I added a comment too. It’s starting to get attention, but the hypocrisy is just staggering.\n\nThis kind of symbolic protest feels good for the artist, but it does absolutely nothing for the people actually under fire.

This term best describes the current state of Russian society.*\n\n&gt;*Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.*\n\n&gt;*It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:*\n\n&gt;*“The Americans let the price of oil fall. The Americans organised a revolution in Ukraine. America hates Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and Ііbеrаlѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brothers stole all the money. But Putin is good.”*\n\n&gt;*There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.*\n\n&gt;*Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.*\n\n&gt;*In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.*",

And West is not interested to spend money on a country that will be most likely invaded again by Russia withing a decade.",

Let this be a(nother) lesson in why Ukrainians deserve alllllll our support. :)\n\n# Great Big Important Note First\n\nThis is going to be an odd couple of weeks. Scott will be delivering [Blyskavka (your ambulance)](https://givebutter.com/ambulance_for_sumy) to Ukraine and I'll be out of service, too.\n\n(I'm also going to Ukraine, but not on a delivery run. Fact is, I suffered a big personal loss earlier this year and I need a vacation in a place that fills and restores my heart. Nothing does that better than Kyiv, so off I go. But with only *one* big heavy suitcase for once.)\n\n**Therefore, we will draw the winners from this week and next week's raffles when we return the week of August 10.** Because of the significant travel, you will see a decrease in our presence and response until then. \n\nLastly, next week's raffle will have a bigger package than usual and we will not have our weekly raffle the week of August 3.\n\nSo! On to the good stuff!\n\n# $2 Tuesday\n\nThis week's $2 Tuesday package includes:\n\n* A framed copy of the famous Ukrainian tractor stamp\n* A stamp sheet celebrating the hero city [Okhtyrka](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/prezident-uzyav-uchast-u-zahodah-z-nagodi-richnici-geroyichn-81877)\n* A challenge coin\n* Two AK casings collected from Krynky, where the Ukrainians kept the russians busy and frustrated for months\n\n# $5 Package\n\nI want this just because the lion is so cool. But I don't allow myself to enter raffles, which means more chances for you to win\n\n* A unit patch from the 118th\n* A signed flag from the 118th\n\n[**Get your tickets here!**](https://givebutter.com/XOIbH3)\n\nGood luck!\n\n**Please note**\n\nThough the event description mentions a livestream, there will be none. And while we do deeply appreciate those of you who choose to donate as well as buying raffle tickets, we want to make it clear that donations are *not* required to enter the raffle. ",

Russia has steadily upgraded its Iranian designed Shaheds (which they call Gerans), to the point where they are now accurate enough to be used in a strike role on the front line rather than in saturation attacks against military and civilian targets deep within Ukraine. They are still a rather blunt instrument, but as you can see here, they pack a much larger punch than FPV drones.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luhmojv7wtef1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9c421b50706486ba02c0ac53e84f6b5117042e\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgjg5gu8wtef1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541ab75bbc12a71497708ad7e0a4a06d309f86a2\n\n* Russian forces have been pushed back here slightly, a welcome change.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7c95nkdwtef1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e031b54c6a966344498844e34b7ee78c20203d\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zn3x008ewtef1.png?width=934&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286d4226317bad37281f28fe00e69224af7b1138\n\n* Small advance by the Russians here, if that pincer goes any further south, it could threaten the salient around Kurylivka.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plb99mjkwtef1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5594ef6111a082f003b519d4a7c02c2788fb80ba\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pobkui4lwtef1.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d59e5e1d03911d4125bce784df571a6cb5d241c0\n\n* Two small advances by the Russians here in the north of the sector.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gd6cia2owtef1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa798ceb355f1f05c6eadb44accdfc5a2b48f499\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvk32noowtef1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd99888857e440224960e60caeb4f3ad9bc103b0\n\n* Russian forces advanced in the south of this sector. The town of Kostiantynivka is apparently under constant Russian drone attack in order to disrupt Ukrainian logistics.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jcjrdqmvwtef1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=090a784396d04ccb4fe8438cc9a5e1b66d07d4c2\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzyg8r8wwtef1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=090238ee8c356b6f0c035162c88db9962d7e97d0\n\n* Russia expanded the grey zone significantly in the north of this sector, but they haven't made any confirmed advances, which is very good. The situation in Pokrovsk, however, remains critical. Russians were apparently able to advance into the city for the first time this week, though they were promptly expelled.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snshnby3xtef1.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb75dbe8d06ad57c7980f99861d1d672fb875348\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82352pj4xtef1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce4a3639d4b275e0231dad029ed9e840b1c57611\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* The Ukrainian parliament passed, and Zelensky signed into law, a controversial bill that brings robs several anti-corruption organizations within the Ukrainian government of their independence, which lead to the first anti-government protests in Ukraine since the war started. It's been difficult for me to figure out what exactly is going on with this bill. I generally trust Zelensky and don't think he's conniving enough that he would seek to reinforce his own power at the cost of the war effort, but fighting corruption is crucial for Ukraine to be able to build a good government, and independence is absolutely crucial for any organization that exists to destroy corruption. The claim of the Ukrainian government is that these organizations were infiltrated by Russian agents, who took advantage of their independence. I can certainly believe this on some level, Russia loves nothing more than ruthlessly exploiting weak points in an opposing nation's society and leveraging those points in bad faith ways to create more division. I can also believe that some individuals within Ukraine were scared of these organizations and jumped at using that infiltration as an excuse to gut them and protect themselves. I'm sure that the truth lies somewhere in between. Zelensky has since promised to do more to fight corruption, and he better be telling the truth.\n* Ukraine is turning more and more to specially designed air interceptor drones that can take down Russian Shaheds at a fraction of the cost of traditional AD missiles. Many of these drones are designed by a company run by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. They use AI in their targeting software and are highly resistant to Russian electronic warfare. I've seen claims that 9 out of 10 Shaheds that get downed in the latest attacks are hit by these interceptors, though that seems like a pretty high estimate to me. Either way, these drones are absolutely crucial to Ukraine's continued ability to defend itself from every more numerous Russian drone attacks.\n* The Pentagon announced a new security assistance tranche for Ukraine, the first since Trump was re-elected. This includes $9 million for the repair of Bradley IFVs, and also more Hawk AD missile systems. While it's a pretty small package, it's still a good thing that Trump is actually authorizing these now.\n* In another sign of changing priorities for the GOP, and how fecklessly beholden they are to Trump, many of the same MAGAs who talked shit about sending aid to Ukraine last year are now on board, and for the first time, more Republicans support sending aid to Ukraine than Democrats, with 64% in total saying we should send more. While I find it pathetic how easily they change their minds for Daddy Trump, this is at least a good sign. Another good sign was that the House overwhelmingly voted to continue providing military support to Ukraine last week, with a 353-76 vote.\n* NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the other day that Russia produces 12 times more artillery ammunition in one year that every NATO country combined, a stark reminder of the difference between a country operating on a war economy basis vs. those that aren't.\n* Increasingly, when Ukraine dismantles crashed Russian drones, they find that the vast majority or even all of the parts in them are made in China. In recognition of this reality, the EU has for the first time sanctioned several Chinese banks. Unfortunately, China has the power to completely sustain the Russian war effort on its, though right now their support is still fairly tepid.\n* The Australian M1 Abrams tanks have now arrived in Ukraine, and presumably will show up at the front reasonably soon. Australia has now provided more Abrams than the US did. These are good tanks, and while they aren't exactly a game changer anymore, each additional tank is quite welcome.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,397 (+56)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,075 (+4)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,071 (+10)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+3)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,432 (+85)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,226 (+9)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,426 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1036 (+20)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 608 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+1)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nUnfortunately, it's another week of higher Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russian ones. One thing that is worth pointing out here, which I've mentioned before, is that this is a sign of Russia running low on armored vehicles. Russia is also increasingly resorting to using motor bikes and ATVs in their assaults, which Oryx does not track. Ukraine, meanwhile, has large numbers of IMVs, both domestically and foreign produced, meaning that they can afford to lose more of them. You'd much rather have an armored car get attacked than a guy on a bike, because the bike guy is going to die with the bike, while the IMV is much more likely to save its occupants.\n\nThank you for reading.",

    "selftext": "I sometimes see supporters of Ukraine here trying to rationalize Ukrainian government decision regarding NABU by the fact that the agency was, ostensibly, \"infiltrated by russians\".\n\nHere's a beautiful explanation of this whole \"russian infiltration\" story by Oleksa Shalayskyi from \"Nashi Hroshi\" (anti-corruption NGO), read it and make your own conclusions:\n\n\"So, here’s the story. The year is 2012. President Yanukovych occasionally tasks the head of his security (State Guard Department) with finding out certain information. But instead of going through Minister Zakharchenko, he uses his own channels. Often, this requires accessing classified law enforcement databases - things like \"who has a criminal case opened or closed against them,\" etc. A subordinate of the security chief mentions that he knows a police officer who can provide such services.  \n\nBack then, these kinds of services were offered by practically anyone who could be bothered - $300, and the information was yours on a flash drive. Businessmen, politicians, criminals, you name it - it was just a \"market service.\" Since the security chief had a budget, the hired cop was paid too. This went on for several years - until the Revolution.  \n\nThen Yanukovych flees along with his security team, but the cop stays in his position. Some time later, he passes a competitive selection process and joins NABU. And that, in principle, should have been the end of the story.  \n\nBut no. Ten years later, in 2023, the SBU  shows up at NABU and says: \"That security officer of Yanukovych who placed the orders? Six years after his last request - in 2020 - he defected to the russians. Let’s use that to pin something on your employee.\"  \n\nNABU is stunned. Still in shock, they respond: \"Well, let’s check whether the detective had any contact with that security officer after the Revolution.\" They check - no contact. \"Let’s interrogate him ourselves,\" suggests NABU. \"No need,\" replies the SBU. \"He shouldn’t know we’re watching him.\"  \n\nA year passes. In 2024, the SBU, disregarding its own secrecy, conducts a search and interrogation of the NABU representative. Afterward, they inform NABU that nothing was found - but only verbally. For a year, NABU asks for official confirmation of the investigation, because they, too, don’t want an unreliable person in their ranks. The SBU remains silent.  \n\nThen another year passes. It’s July 2025. The SBU closes the case against the same employee based on the same decade-old grounds. They issue a press release that makes zero sense compared to the actual story I just laid out. Personally, after reading it, I was convinced that the NABU detective had been selling secret information to russian spies during the war.  \n\nNow, here’s the question. Suppose the SBU considers it treason against Ukraine if you provided services to some guy who, five years later, became a traitor.  \n\nI think a high-ranking police officer from Yanukovych’s era - let’s say, someone with the last name Tatarov (*OP's note: Oleh Tatarov is the Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine*) - also provided plenty of services to people who later betrayed Ukraine. And even without Tatarov, you could compile a similar list of traitors numbering in the tens of thousands. Yet there are no press releases about their arrests.  \n\nEither the security services aren’t doing their job - or, on the contrary, they’re working very well, just not in Ukraine’s interest.\"\n\nOriginal text in Ukrainian can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/oleksa.shalayskiy/posts/pfbid0Rn3NnPLt8jTqREioYa3WdtYmTiUefSmnL6CXsSg5wqg2dqcnnN8j6Dan9EJxGvanl",

The very feature that could allow them to be effective.\n\nThe proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code solve none of their efficiency problems. Instead, anti-corruption bodies are being handed over to manual control by those who, throughout Ukraine's independence, failed to fight corruption but somehow became very good at leading it.  \n\nYou don’t trust NABU and SAP? Fine. Now they’re being subordinated to the Prosecutor General's Office - an institution we all trust so much that we’ve got enough leftover trust for three more just like it, apparently.\n\nAn office that has always been effective, independent, and never once caught up in corruption - hell, not even seen standing near corrupt officials in the smoking area. (s)\n\nThe glorious traditions of honesty and effectiveness among Ukraine’s Prosecutors General stretch all the way from Kuzmin and Pshonka to Ryaboshapka and \"prosecutor is my guy\" Venediktova.\n\nSo this whole nonsense about NABU being unlikely corrupt - more corrupt than the SBU or the Prosecutor General’s Office - and the only solution being to destroy NABU’s independence is pure bullshit.

    "selftext": "11 years ago, the Revolution of Dignity put an end to the uncertainty and “multi-vector” nature of Ukrainian politics and confirmed the European choice of the Ukrainian people. That same year, the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU was signed and ratified. In the following years, the Free Trade Area and visa-free regime came into effect, the course toward EU membership was enshrined in the Constitution of Ukraine, and, ultimately, Ukraine applied for membership, received candidate status, and began negotiations. Today, the European Union and its members are reliable partners of Ukraine in strengthening defense and financing the state budget of Ukraine.\n\nAt all these stages, independent anti-corruption institutions were and remain one of the key conditions for Ukraine’s European integration. This was a direct requirement of the Association Agreement, one of the main conditions for the visa-free regime, and one of the seven key conditions to be fulfilled for the start of accession negotiations, among others. Independent and effective anti-corruption institutions are not a technical detail but a systemic requirement for Ukraine’s European integration. They are one of the main criteria for assessing Ukraine’s progress toward EU membership and an important marker of trust from European partners, a symbol of political and value compatibility.\n\nDraft Law No. 12414, adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, destroys the independence of anti-corruption bodies, turning them into subdivisions of an unreformed and politically dependent prosecutor’s office, and significantly limits the effectiveness of these bodies by depriving them of the ability to maintain confidentiality of investigations.\n\nIn essence, this means destroying one of the most important factors that keeps the door open for Ukraine to the European Union, ensures trust and support from European partners — vital in times of war — and fuels the Ukrainian dream of a better future that gives people strength both at the front and at home.\n\nAmong other things, this creates grounds for rolling back the existing achievements of European integration and dramatically increases financial risks for the country.\n\nWe, representatives of Ukrainian civil society, were among those who, during the Revolution of Dignity, won Ukraine’s European perspective. Knowing the position of European partners, we regard the current developments as a disruption of the course toward European integration — a course paid for not only by the hundred lives of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred but also by the many thousands of lives of ATO heroes and, later, Ukraine’s Defense Forces in the course of the full-scale war.\n\nTogether with the breakdown of the reboot of the Bureau of Economic Security and the High Qualification Commission of Judges, the use of politically motivated selective justice against civic activists, servicemen, journalists, and others, this creates a sense of returning to 2013, when Ukraine’s geopolitical and civilizational choice had not yet been made.\n\nOnly now the circumstances are entirely different. The fourth year of full-scale war requires maximum unity and concentration of efforts by the state, society, and our European partners. In the conditions of economic decline, catastrophic lack of financial resources, fragile external political support, and even more fragile social cohesion inside the country — this creates extraordinary risks for Ukrainian statehood.\n\nWe call on the President of Ukraine to take a statesmanlike position: weigh the risks and veto the adopted draft Law, thereby confirming to Ukrainian society and European partners Ukraine’s commitment to its European choice.\n\nP.S. This statement was drafted and signed by many before the Law came into force yesterday evening. Therefore, the demand of this statement must now read as follows:\nWe call on the President of Ukraine and the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to take a statesmanlike position: weigh the risks and take the necessary actions to repeal the Law, thereby confirming to Ukrainian society and European partners Ukraine’s commitment to its European choice.\n\n⸻\n\nSignatories:\n\nBusiness Communities:\nCEO Club Ukraine\nBusiness Community Board\nNGO “Business Association ‘We-Khersonians’”\nNGO “Association of Private Employers”\nDrupal Ukraine Community\nNGO “National Organization of Retail Trade”\nNGO “Entrepreneurs’ Club of Bukovyna”\nNGO “Alumni Association of Kyiv-Mohyla Business School”\n\nCivil Society Organizations:\nCivic Platform “New Country”\nCharitable Foundation “From the Country to Ukraine”\nBilozersky Center for Regional Development\nNGO BCD\nNGO “Social Capital”\nNGO “Ukrainian World”\nNGO “Boyko Ethnological Society”\nNGO “STAN”\nNGO “Learn”\nUkrainian Foundation for Legal Aid\nNGO “Horizon of Changes”\nNGO “Country of Free Community”\nCenter for Civil Liberties\nNGL.media\nNGO “Ukrainian Association of Students”\nNGO Crisis Media Center Siversky Donets\nNGO “Higher”\nIndependent Anti-Corruption Commission (NAKO)\nNGO “Red Guber”\nNGO “Agency for Urban Initiatives”\nNGO “Agency for Sustainable Development and Innovation”\nNGO “Rivne Center ‘Social Partnership’” (GI “For Honest Tender”)\nCharitable Foundation “Library Country”\nNGO “Zero Waste Lutsk”\nNGO “International Institute for Integral Development”\nNGO “Coalition of Culture Actors”\nNGO “Anti-Corruption Headquarters”\nNGO “Foundation for Institutional Development”\nNGO “Ukrainian Pirate Community”\nNGO “Toloka Association”\nNGO “Center Dobrochin”\nNGO “Women’s Anti-Corruption Movement”\nNGO “Chernihiv Center for Human Rights”\nNGO “Ukrainian Fishermen’s Club”\nNGO “Center for Journalistic Investigations ‘Power of Truth’”\n\nAnalytical Centers:\nCenter for Economic Strategy\nInstitute for Analytics and Advocacy\nOffice of the Chief Economist of the Coalition of Business Communities for the Modernization of Ukraine\nAnalytical Center Advanter Group\nInstitute for Economic Leadership\nNGO “Technologies of Progress”\nNetwork for the Protection of National Interests “ANTS”\nInstitute for Socio-Economic Transformation\nNGO Center for Social and Economic Research — CASE Ukraine\nFuture Development Agency\nNGO Analytical and Consulting Center for Public Governance and Law\nNGO “Center for Public Expertise”\nNGO “Center for Reform and Local Development”\nInterdisciplinary Scientific and Educational Center for Anti-Corruption (ACREC)\nNGO “Youth Democratic Association ‘YODA’”\nPoltava Branch of the Public Service of Ukraine\n\n⸻\n\nA form to join the statement is in the comments.\nPlease share.",

And it's not okay. Compared to the tempo of 2022 when Ukraine often moved ahead of the plan and passed the checks long before the deadline.

Slavery, while great for the plantation owners, is terrible for a national economy. There's economic incentives to abolish slavery. The enslaved don't pay taxes, and aren't good consumers. From the perspective of running a country, it's a terrible system. Which is also why Catherine the Great of Russia abolished slavery, by the way.\n\nThe propaganda, however, makes it very clear that the soldiers and their support were mobilized with moral and ethical arguments. 'The enslaved don't pay taxes' isn't going to convince anyone to fight. Pamflets showing pictures of enslaved children, and the famous photographs of Peter, The Scourged Back... Now *that* would get a young citizen's blood boiling and trigger finger itching. Rightfully so, of course. I'm just saying that the interests of the general public and the interest of their country as an institution weren't necessarily aligned.\n\nI'm gonna be real honest: the countries that support Ukraine don't do it out of democratic principle. Sure, sure, our politicians do want to score brownie points with the voter, absolutely. But the support is also simply a matter of self-defense by proxy.\n\nUkraine's gotten a lot of financial support from especially the EU, in return for tackling their corruption problem. This is because the EU wanted to invest in Ukraine for mostly economic reasons. Ukraine has wheat and oil aplenty. But if your investment is disappearing into the pockets of criminals, then that's no use. Would Ukraine benefit from better relations with the EU, even membership? Absolutely. It's a win-win situation. But it's a *win-win* situation; the EU wouldn't do it if it didn't also win.\n\nWe, The People want Ukrainians to prosper in freedom because Ukrainians are people, and Ukraine is close to us.

Not to mention how would Ukraine be right now if he had fled at the beggining of the full scale invasion instead of staying and fighting, and the job he's being doing these years to gather internarional support for Ukraine, even withstanding humilliations by trump and his minions.

I became a teacher, teaching English to some of the thousands of Ukrainian refugees who came into Lithuania. Now though, I’ve graduated and don’t have much to do, and most of all, don’t feel like I have a purpose.\n\nI am desperately searching for meaningful work, and the most meaningful work I’ve done to date has been the aforementioned teaching job, helping Ukrainians. This is a theme I want to continue, and as directly as possible—in Ukraine itself if necessary. \n\nMy question therefore is if there are civilian military support roles I could fill in Ukraine, as a volunteer. I don’t have any military experience, but I’m a pretty capable person when it comes to clerical work, teaching, writing, research, or outreach. Really, I’m open to anything. ",

Even within Ukraine farmers could theoretically survive by somehow procuring enough food to fullfill Russia's ridiculously high quotas. And once Ukraine was sufficiently devastated to not be able to question Moscow's rule Moscow more or less did not care that Ukrainians had survived.\n\nNazi Germany by contrast would seek Jews out no matter where they lived within the areas they ruled. They would even press countries they did not directly rule (Hungary, Italy) to exterminate or hand over their jews. Genocide was not a means to an end that they would stop employing once that end was reached, killing jews was the end in itself, even overriding pressing war needs.",

The allies were losing the battle of the Atlantic: U-boats were sinking so many ships that there was a distinct possibility that the United Kingdom would have to surrender, which would have been disastrous for the rest of the world, not least the USSR and India. Winston Churchill was later to state: ‘The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land, at sea or in the air depended ultimately on its outcome’ (Costello &amp; Hughes, \\[1977\\]. ‘The supply situation in Britain was such there was talk of being unable to continue the war, with supplies of fuel being particularly low’ (Costello &amp; Hughes, \\[1977\\]\n\nUsually the claim that the famine was deliberate is combined with the claim that Churchill was a racist driven by hate.

This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms which have inflicted serious damage on the Indian spring crops. India’s shortage cannot be overcome by any possible surplus of rice even if such a surplus could be extracted from the peasants. Our recent losses in the Bombay explosion have accentuated the problem.\n\n&gt;...\n\n&gt;I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia without reducing the assistance you are now providing for us, who are at a positive minimum if war efficiency is to be maintained.

It appears this number in total is under 100,000, probably closer to 50,000 including 5,000 on the trail of tears.  This is barely a blip on the radar for this table.  \n\nCivil War was a bit different.  Conditions were horrible and many soldiers died in POW camps due to dysentery than battle.  Natchez Mississippi, Richmond VA, and Memphis Tennessee were put under horrible sieges (with Atlanta GA burned down), killing thousands of civilians. Famine was rampant at times. We can put Civil War related deaths at 1M being super generous; however, a much smaller amount would have been intentional genocide and maybe 100,000 civilians would be this number.  There was post Civil War food shortage that killed a few thousand in the South too.  \n\nSo USA is maybe 100,000 1776-1990 (Indians) and 100,000 1860-1865 (civil war).  These are guesstimates.  \n\n*** USA in 1900-2000:\n\nOne would think Vietnam would register but intentional killings of Vietnamese would have been incredibly limited.  Iraq War would have killed many civilians but probably not intentionally.  Any takers on this one?\n\nWW2 —- there were significant deaths from starvation and malnutrition among Germans in the immediate aftermath of World War II, particularly during 1945 and 1946. The war had devastated Germany's infrastructure, disrupted food production, and led to severe shortages of essential supplies.\n\nIn the winter of 1945-46, the situation was dire, with millions of displaced persons, returning soldiers, and refugees adding pressure to an already strained food supply. The Allied occupation forces struggled to provide adequate food aid, and the harsh winter exacerbated the crisis. Estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Germans may have died from starvation or related health issues during this period.  Occupied by the US, have to factor this in?\n\nBy 1948, the situation began to improve with the introduction of the Marshall Plan and various economic reforms, which helped stabilize food supplies and promote recovery. \n\n*** USA 2001-Present\n\nIraq Wars and Afghanistan Wars would have killed many civilians by collateral damage and intentionality is questionable especially in a fight with the adversary blended in with civilians.  Any takers on this one?\n\n*** Because someone will ask:\n\nSeparately, diseases/viruses introduced by Europeans killed 90% of most indigenous peoples in North and South America due to contact with diseases they had never encountered (that Europeans were used to).  This would have been in the millions however it’s before 1776 and mainly under Spanish colonies and French colonies.  There’s evidence of blankets being given to Indians contaminated intentionally with European diseases but largely these deaths were unintentional and little was known about diseases back then.",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, it's Thursday so time for another update on Ukraine. While the political situation seems to be getting better, the situation in some parts of the front seems to be deteriorating. More on that below. If you'd like to get these updates in your inbox, please check out my profile for the link to my substack.\n\n**Video of the week:**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1m29m97/video/vx8ovmi9xfdf1/player\n\n* This video demonstrates the results of the German-made Skynex air defense system as it shoots down many Shahed one way attack drones. The system is a 35mm automatic cannon mounted on truck with a powerful radar. It can track and destroy slow flying drones very cost-effectively since it only has to shoot a relatively small burst to down a drone, thanks to its remarkable accuracy. Systems like this are some of the most important anti-drone weapons out there.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2i3yk1rxfdf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d916be47e4261b06145dcc6dfb79cbcb5e4f2fa2\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyrzdz96yfdf1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4caaa4668008cbb756479547545e20d1df4553f8\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10p4o0e8yfdf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d44129de715cccf8ca9f12302d84bed8d2b6f3aa\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngdm0b49yfdf1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=524f2d85b29ebbeeb85560e73ee634f84f8db4b2\n\n* No changes here.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l06k3j4byfdf1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77bd9b971fed6f19940127e4d555cbb81fcdae2b\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bokk4iobyfdf1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0adeae5c755d30755c2a3f777eaa3ef91c384153\n\n* Small advance made by the Russians in the salient north of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjx537ngyfdf1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b84210da4fcd3f3ca31be95f933bbcd988d65a4\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsxvow8hyfdf1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fdac371d4a43265bd89f4a90be873abefbd727\n\n* Russia advanced to close a gap in their lines south of Chasiv Yar.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnpkt6nlyfdf1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf58014673b117d69648fb5cf8f029640256e355\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hfird28myfdf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ec4de0e4a3fb63e164b9d3ee614e98fabd01c8\n\n* Extremely critical Russian advance here north of Myrnohrad. The cutting off and encirclement of both Myrnohrad and Pokrovsk is now a real possibility, which has been the goal of Russian offensive efforts here for months. If I were Ukraine, I would use all possible force to attack that Russian pincer north of Myrnohrad. Unfortunately, they may not have the reserves to do that.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s0k9w0qq2gdf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f229b741dc0c55ffe39c5f2a4f56c194976104c2\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/awv8nqer2gdf1.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9037ee1b14136edfac0dac1c442093bca89cd0\n\n* Russians keep advancing north of Velyka Novosilka, no other changes besides that.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump announced that Russia would have 50 days to come to the table with a real offer before he allows the sanctions bill that has huge support in Congress to go through. This bill would hit Russia harder with sanctions than anything before, including tough secondary sanctions in the form of steep tariffs on any country that does a lot of business with Russia, particularly India and China. Potential sanctions on India are especially interesting since they are pretty close with Trump, though they are also one of the biggest external funders of Russia's war since they buy huge amounts of Russian oil. He additionally authorized the first new presidential draw down aid package for Ukraine since he's been president, allowing hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to be sent.\n* He also announced, alongside NATO head and all-around good guy Mark Rutte, that a deal is being worked out whereby European nations will buy large amounts of American war materiel to donate to Ukraine. While it's not as good as straight up aid, this will still result in a substantial amount of support for Ukraine. The first package is estimated to be worth $10 billion, which is more than any individual aid package we sent to Ukraine.\n* France and Italy, however, have both said they are opting out of this deal, as they greatly prefer to spend money on domestically produced systems. Both countries are still strong supporters of Ukraine, but they don't want to buy American arms when they could use the money to benefit their own economies, and, especially in the case of France, already produce domestic versions of most of the equipment required.\n* Germany announced that it is providing long range strike weapons to Ukraine. Whether or not these are the infamous Taurus missiles they've been waffling about sending for years now is unclear, though it seems like it might be. Long overdue if so.\n* Reporting also indicated this week that during Trump's call with Zelensky last week, he asked whether Ukraine was capable of hitting Moscow and St. Petersburg to force Russia to the negotiating table. While he later seemed to walk back this sentiment, it shows that Trump is interested in some way in hitting Putin where it hurts.\n* I've also seen an unconfirmed report that all restrictions on the use of ATACMS will be lifted, allowing Ukraine to strike anywhere in Russia within range, though I need to see more confirmation on this.\n* A high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence officer was assassinated by individuals working for Russia's FSB intelligence service in Kyiv. This was a rare success by the FSB within Ukraine. Ukraine's SBU service claimed to have killed the assassins in a gunfight several days later.\n* According to an analysis by the Economist, in the past year Russia has gained about .038 square kilometers of territory for each dead soldier. At the rate they are going, it would take 89 years for them to seize all of Ukraine. While this analysis obviously doesn't take into account the possibility of front collapses allowing Russia to move faster, it's still worth keeping in mind when you read that Russia is advancing.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,341 (+46)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,071 (+6)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,061 (+7)\n* Russian SPG losses: 957 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 339 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,347 (+55)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,217 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,419 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1016 (+12)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 597 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of fairly light vehicle losses on both sides, though it's always a bit concerning to see Ukrainian losses be higher than Russian losses. I've also noticed that the loss rate of Ukrainian SPG systems has gone up in the past few months. They have tons of these and are able to domestically produce large numbers of them, so they can make up these losses, but it definitely seems like Russia has been able to step up its ability to target them.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading.",

    "selftext": "Two grand scandals are currently raging in Poland. \n\nPolish Nazis, led by Grzegorz Braun, are denying that Jews were killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz. I won't even go into the details here - this is wild nonsense and conspiracy theory. Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski gave the Nazis a \"kurwa mać\" and told that \"scumbag\" everything he thinks about it. And in general, everything he said was right.\n\nAt the same time, an exhibition \"Our Boys\" about Poles in the Wehrmacht is opening in Gdansk. During World War II, from 375,000 to 500,000 Polish boys from Silesia, Pomerania and other regions were mobilized into the Third Reich. These are the estimates of Polish historians. \n\nOn our website \"Historical Truth\" there is an excellent overview of the problem by Yurko Rudnytskyi \"Collaboration in Polish\": https://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2018/04/23/152331/\n\nA significant part of these Poles, by the way, fought on the Eastern Front, here in Ukraine, for example. There are a lot of studies and popular books. There are testimonies of participants and witnesses of the events, for example, Michal Bristiger describes his clash with fellow countrymen at the train station in Dnipropetrovsk sometime in 1942, when all around the soldiers in German uniforms spoke Polish among themselves. \n\nHere is my review of this book: https://www.istpravda.com.ua/reviews/2011/12/7/64492/\n\nThe exhibition \"Our Boys\" caused an explosion of indignation: President Duda, Deputy Prime Minister Kosyniak-Kamysz and a bunch of other politicians, from the left, the right, from the government, from the opposition, across the political spectrum, spoke out against it. Politicians do not like that the real events of Polish history do not fit into the image of a tragic victim of history. \n\nThe Polish myth of World War II is a myth about how Poles suffered the most among all European nations. There is only place for heroes and victims in this myth. If something does not fit into this myth, it is all the worse for the facts that undermine this myth. \n\nMore details about how collective memory in Poland mythologized the real facts of Polish history during World War II - in my review of the study by Polish sociologists \"What Poles Really Think About Ukrainians in World War II\": https://www.istpravda.com.ua/reviews/2012/01/13/66369/\n\nThat is, two mirror processes are currently taking place in Poland. \n\nFirst, Polish Nazis deny the Holocaust and other \"inconvenient\" pages of the complex history of Polish-Jewish relations during World War II. For example, the mass murder of Jews by Poles in the town of Jedwabne. \n\nSecond, Polish politicians across the political spectrum deny the facts of forced (but massive) collaboration of Poles with the Third Reich army, despite the fact that the topic has been thoroughly researched by Polish historians.\n\nThat is, the facts of history are very unpleasant to Polish politicians. But we (historians) have no other history than the one that existed for you (politicians). \n\nFor comparison. \n\n375-500 thousand Poles wore Nazi uniforms during World War II.\n\n250 thousand Ukrainians joined the military formations of the German occupiers at the same time. \n\nBut. \n\nIn total, 6 million 351 thousand Ukrainians fought with weapons in their hands on the side of the United Nations against Nazism. \n\nOf these, 2 million 800 thousand died in that struggle. \n\nMoreover, 700 thousand soldiers and officers mobilized from Ukraine fell on the territory of modern Poland in the fight against the Nazis. \n\nThat is, on the territory of modern Poland, more Ukrainians died in battles with the Wehrmacht than there were Poles in the Wehrmacht. \n\n700 thousand Ukrainians against the Wehrmacht vs 500 thousand Poles in the Wehrmacht. \n\nThe total number of Poles who died in the armed struggle against Nazism, according to Polish historians, is slightly less than 250 thousand. \n\nIn the photo - the then Prime Minister of Poland Tadeusz Morawiecki lays flowers on the grave of collaborators from the Świętokrzyskie Brigade in Munich on February 17, 2018.",

        "body": "**Before I say anything, let me make one thing absolutely clear: I am in no way defending the Nazis or anyone who collaborated with them. Fuck the Nazis and their collaborators.**\n\nThat said, it’s important to understand *why* some people chose to collaborate with Nazi Germany—not to justify their actions, but to preserve historical truth. Today, we rightly recognise the Nazi regime as one of the greatest evils in history. But in the early years of the war, that wasn’t always obvious to everyone. The full scale of Nazi atrocities only became widely known after the liberation of concentration camps toward the end of the war. Even in Poland—where the worst of these horrors occurred—many people were unaware of what was happening outside major cities, especially in rural areas.\n\nMy grandparents and great-grandparents lived in eastern Poland, in a region that changed hands multiple times due to shifting borders under the **Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact**—the secret agreement between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. They experienced occupation by both regimes, and here’s what they used to tell me:\n\n“When the Germans were in charge, they demanded obedience. You had to follow their orders, but for the most part they let you live in peace. They would come to the farm and take food for their soldiers, but they knew we were a big family with children, so they left enough for us to survive.  \nWhen the Soviets came, they didn’t care. They took everything. They would pillage the farm, steal from our house, and they raped and killed for sport.”\n\nIt’s stories like these that help me understand why some people in similar circumstances might have collaborated with the Germans—particularly if it gave them a chance to resist or fight back against the Soviets. That doesn’t make it right. But the moral landscape was far more complex on the ground than it appears in hindsight.\n\nIt’s worth remembering that many in the **Baltic states** and some regions of **Ukraine** initially welcomed the arrival of German forces. After years of brutal repression, forced deportations, and political purges under Soviet rule, the Nazis were seen—at least briefly—as potential liberators.\n\nOf course, today the Nazi swastika is a universal symbol of hate and genocide. But back then, to many people caught in the chaos of shifting frontlines and collapsing regimes, it was just another flag—one more invading force among others.",

Plenty of Russians also ended up as POWs in concentration camps. My grandpa saw Auschwitz in action and his recounts still haunt me. He was transferred to Dauhau and whilst there, he managed to trade a lighter for a spoon with a Russian in order to cut the 'bread' into thin slices so everyone could get a piece alongside water melted from snow to make a dipping 'broth' to make it 'tolerable' \n\nThey were given bread that consisted of saw dust to eat and even resorted to eating the maggots off the bodies.

Her stories about the Soviets on their march to Berlin are… horrific does not describe it well enough I’m afraid. At around 13, Soviet soldiers passed on her as she was too skinny but they took her best friend and her friend’s mother away. She says all she remembers was hearing the two gun shots. They made her walk through a burning town on her flight west, if she died oh well.

Soviets not only committed horrible crimes against humanity themselves, they also supported nazi Germany for years, and eventually they instigated the second world war by signing the molotov-ribbentrop pact. The direct outcome was German aggression against Poland which caused allies to declare war on Germany, but Soviet aggression against Poland was not punished and not even discussed for years. \n\n\nI also think that violence between Ukrainians and Poles was started by false flag operations by either Germany or Soviets, as the politics of 'divide and conquer' was always the trademark of russians. See the acts of violence in Azerbaijan that led to Armenian-Azerbaijan war and push both countries back for decades (and turned Armenia into the puppetstate of russia, dependent on russian military and support); or acts of violence in  Moldova that led to de facto russian occupation of parts of Moldova and pushed the country back for decades; or acts of violence in Georgia that again lead to the war and russian occupation of parts of Georgia; or violence in Ukraine that lead to war and russian occupation of parts of Ukraine.

The thing is: I don't have that much experience so I don't know if I could help. In order to get experience I would have to start my residency but that would take 5 years and I hope the war has ended by then.  Is there anyone who can give me some resources? Or maybe someone working in a Ukrainian Hospital that can tell me how's working there? \n\nI'm from Italy btw. Thank you!",

But this time I was confronted with a fact: You have to come while the village is still ours. It was quite strange for me to be asked this question. I started looking for train and bus tickets to get there. The next available seats were two weeks away. I told my uncle Ilya that, and they told me that two weeks might be too late. It was strange for me, even though I live in a region partially affected by the fighting. After that, I put everything on hold and bought more expensive bus tickets. When I arrived in this village, I couldn't stop admiring the wide streets and flower gardens near every yard. It was Ukraine, but a different region, and there was a lot of unusual and at the same time ordinary. Of course, I couldn't ignore my uncle Ilya's garden and his harvest. Because of the proximity to the front, I did not take pictures of my uncle's house and his neighbors, but I really wanted to, because they are very beautiful and cozy. I left this town with the best impressions of the beautiful places in our country.\n\n\n\nA week later, Russian shells began to attack the village. Uncle Ilya and his family are now preparing to evacuate. Most families have already left with their children. The video shows a car with belongings, so apparently someone was also preparing to evacuate. This blooming town will soon be destroyed like dozens of others. The harvest will remain unharvested....  \n\n\n\n\n*Translated with* [*DeepL.com*](https://www.deepl.com/?utm_campaign=product&amp;utm_source=web_translator&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=copy_free_translation) *(free version)*",

        "body": "u/super__hoser I love this curve, Well first off the graph is interesting in itself. Because the increase is correlated with the immense losses of land sea and air assets from Russian side, We all are very aware that Russia has lost its edge, best men and majority of its most valuable assets. Armor, Aircrafts, Airdefence and the Black sea fleet.\n\nOn the other hand we have Ukraine that had so little to begin with, but the survival fighting sprit and steady growth in rearming, modernizing, training and adopting. They now have supplies coming in at a continuous growing volume, and advanced ways of attack, like air strikes with heavy guided munition. The big wheels is turning now, and Putins stupid public war crimes and provocations against the west, has been accelerating things, and made a coalition against him. So the balance is really tipping over and come crashing hard on Russia now.\n\nFor me to see, this curve has rising casualties and potential less dead over time as we know of (gap). But the big issue here is covering up the death, by the mass cremation of dead in Crimea, and mass burial. Pictures has been publicized at several occasions, and widow compensation money has not been released. So deaths MUST be higher than expected in this curve.\n\nWith the amount of long distance and bunker busting capable weapons coming online now, I cant see this will ever break downwards, until Putin is taken off power and fully pulls back. The Ukrainian grinder has some huge teeth's now, and the KPIs that was discussed recently, about reaching 30.000 monthly casualties on Russia. That should be reachable production numbers from Ukraine soon.\n\nI sad it before and I say it again. Ukraine is backed by the free world, and many Russian south eastern republics want to break free, they see their rare opportunity for freedom. That is both showing support, and connect with new relations and defense partners for the future. Putins is badly supported by war criminals, dictators, murderers, religious fanatics, despots and their minions. Erdogan is now silent, Fucko/Fico is dampened, and Orban is reconsidering his position as well. Everyone knows where this goes from now, everyone sees the Russians being forced to their knees now.  Russian supporters are all like Putin, and only into this for the power, robbing people and stealing ressources. That's why Russia is failing.\n\nMark my word:\n\n# There is no honor among thieves.",

Even if he seizes all the wealth of the rich, much of it is not in liquid assets, so it won't fully fund his war effort. As it stands right now the costs of the war and civilian needs far exceed his income from all these sources. This is well known. Even the Russian state itself acknowledges this fact. Their economy is on a slow, but steady, downward spiral.

    "selftext": "Let's take a break from war posting to discuss everyone's favorite way to waste time: navigating Ukrainian government bureaucracy. And like Ukrainian bureaucracy, this post is long and annoying and could easily be half the size it actually is, but I am mad and frustrated so I will rant a little.\n\nI am a foreigner living in Ukraine, I am married to a Ukrainian woman and have a residency permit. She just gave birth to our daughter in Lviv. We are going through the process to register her and get a birth certificate. We have an issue with how the family affairs office is assigning her patronymic. For the sake of this post I will pretend my name is Andrew, it's not true but it works well to explain the issue.\n\nWhen my passport is officially translated, it says something like Ендрю. The Ukrainian \"version\" of my name is Андрій. Everyone knows this, it's clear that these are the same names, just in different cultures. We want her patronymic to be based off Андрій because it sounds normal and flows really well with her first name. I assumed this wouldn't be an issue because, you know, it's our child and not the Ukrainian government's child, so we should be able to choose what her name is, and we are not asking for a completely different patronymic or a non-patronymic middle name.\n\nHowever the family affairs office insists that her patronymic must use my name as it appears in my translated passport (Ендрю). It wouldn't be so bad if they would let us use something like Ендрївна. But they insist her patronymic must be my *entire* first name, with the suffix -ївна.\n\nЕндрюївна sounds a little ridiculous in our opinion, I think this is the kind of thing a child might be made fun of for in school .-. they said we could also just omit the patronymic entirely and she would only have a first and last name on her Ukrainian documents. This is bullshit in my opinion, I like the idea of her having a traditional Ukrainian name with a patronymic, we don't do this in my own country so it is an interesting cultural connection for me and her. My wife's father's name is Андрій, so it would also be cute if our daughter had the same patronymic as her mother. On her citizenship documents for my own country, we can pick whatever middle name we want so of course she will have Andriivna, it would be kind of funny if her \"true\" traditional Ukrainian name was only on her non-Ukrainian documents. But mostly I am just frustrated that something that doesn't really matter to the Ukrainian Government (it's just a way to identify her to them), but really matters a lot to the parents, is being strictly kept out of our control.\n\nIs there anyway I, as the father, can write some kind of document authorizing this specific patronymic? Would getting a lawyer involved help at all? It is hard for me to just accept that we can't name our child how we want.\n",

So if the name is \"Andrew\", they will make the patronimic based on \"Andrew\", not \"Andrii\", or the _transcribed, not translated_ version of it.\n\nIn my Ukranian wife's case, with her passport they made a transcription from Cyrillic to Latin alphabet. Her name in both of our languages is pretty much the same (just a very slight difference in pronuntiation with two sounds, and the fact of using a different alphabet, Cyrillic vs Latin). The result of the transcription is _almost_ the same than in my language, but with a repeated letter that is not repeated in my language. Ironically, this similitude makes more trouble than if it was a very different thing. Both versions (when written in Latin) are so close, that most people here tend to ignore the repetition as if it was a typo or something, so she always has to be careful and insist on it whenever she's making any official paperwork, bureaucracy, etc, like residence permit, driving license, contracts, and whatnot. Otherwise she could have some problems or at least, would have to make more paperwork to correct it.\n\nHonestly, I don't think you'll succed with that (I might be wrong). The patronimic is not an equivalent to like an English middle name that you can choose. Although not exactly the same, it would be more similar to a family name: you have the one you have.

It is hard for me to just accept that we can't name our child how we want.\n\nThat's a tough one. Your best chance of getting something done is redoing translation of your own name. Your second-best choice is citing the cultural practices of your culture and refuse patronymic altogether or bullshit confidently enough to get something inbetween. The latter may not fly.\n\n&gt; But they insist her patronymic must be my entire first name, with the suffix -ївна.\n\nThis is how it works and you can't argue with it really. Nothing in the law says how to form patronymics by the way, it's a language thing. Not all patronymics are -ївна, there are some pattern-breakers.\n\nArguing with registry officials in general is hard, they are bound by instruction and are difficult to get things done that *are* in a law, but something they are not familiar with in daily practice. It's also kind of a good thing, at least when they are acting in good faith. You don't want creativity in your bureaucracy.\n\n&gt;When my passport is officially translated, it says something like Ендрю. The Ukrainian \"version\" of my name is Андрій. Everyone knows this, it's clear that these are the same names, just in different cultures\n\nThat's what you think, but that's not what the law thinks. If your name is Ендрю, you aren't Андрій. Shocking, but also Михайло, Майкл and Міхеіл (everybody's favorite president) are different names.\n\nYes, registry officials would do Майкловна, Джонівна and Родрігішна without thinking twice.\n\nAs unfair as it sounds, you couldn't as adult change your patronymic to something random before 2020 (see amusing ECHR ruling https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/974_960 ). For children before 16 years of age it's just fathers name (if mother is married).\n\nYou could ask them what you want, get a refusal and spend few years in courts, maybe you will even win.",

Imagery of the attack was posted on a Russian Telegram with a winking face emoji and a comment incorrectly describing her as a \"soldier\".\n\n\n\n&gt;The footage captured during the attacks on Ukrainian civilians are shared and celebrated on Russian social media channels. Zabrisky said that many of the drones are purchased through fundraisers organized by Russian civilians, and Russian soldiers then share their drone footage showcasing Ukrainian deaths online so that supporters of the fundraisers can see their \"return on investment\". Pop music is sometimes added to the footage.",

Citizens will not stand up for civic rights. The Russian people suffer from a victim complex: they believe that nothing depends on them, and by them nothing can be changed.\n\n&gt;‘It’s always been so’, they say, signing off on their civic impotence. The economic dislocation of the nineties, the cheerless noughties, and now President Vladimir Putin’s iron rule – with its fake elections, corrupt bureaucracy, monopolization of mass media, political trials and ban on protest – have inculcated a feeling of total helplessness. People do not vote in elections: ‘They’ll choose for us anyway;’ they don’t attend public demonstrations: ‘They’ll be dispersed anyway;’ they don’t fight for their rights: ‘We’re alive, and thank god for that.’\n\n&gt;A 140-million-strong population exists in a somnambulistic state, on the verge of losing the last trace of their survival instinct. They hate the authorities, but have a pathological fear of change. They feel injustice, but cannot tolerate activists. They hate bureaucracy, but submit to total state control over all spheres of life. They are afraid of the police, but support the expansion of police control. **They know they are constantly being deceived, but believe the lies fed to them on television.**\n\n  \nShe hit the nail on the head about her fellow Russians when she noted:\n\n\n\n&gt;All that remains for those ashamed of the present and afraid of the future is pride in the past. **When there’s no reason to love your country, hate your neighbours. If you are unable to improve your life, ruin someone else’s.**\n\n\n\nThe Russians with their pathological complexes and sordid history consistently remind me of the observation that one must not help someone who refuses to be helped. \n\nWhat's left then is only vigorous and decisive defense against such malevolence and sense of butthurt.\n\nHow many more \"second chances\" do we in the civilized world are to keep handing out to the \"oppressed\" and \"misunderstood\" Russians so that they finally get their ѕhіt together?

This term best describes the current state of Russian society.\n\n&gt;**Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.**\n\n&gt;It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:\n\n&gt;“The Аmеrісаnѕ let the price of oil fall. The Аmеrісаnѕ organised a revolution in Ukraine. Аmеrіса hаtеѕ Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and ІіbеrаІѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brоthеrѕ stole all the money. But Putin is good.”\n\n&gt;There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.\n\n&gt;Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.\n\n&gt;In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.\n\n&gt;The absolute lack of understanding of the value of life is just as infantile.\n\n&gt;It is not acceptable for adults to inflate a frog with a straw, to decapitate a puppy, to pound residential neighbourhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction, or to shoot down passenger jets with surface-to-air missiles while thinking:\n\n&gt;“What difference does it make whether it was a passenger jet or not? The birdie is down, hooray! We did warn them not to fly in our skies!”\n\n&gt;The failure to grasp the value of life, including one’s own, is perhaps the main characteristics of an infantile person. In addition to the lack of any logical thinking.\n\n&gt;That is a world where causal links are broken, where actions and consequences are not related in any manner, and where throwing eggs from the window and a cuff on the ear are two totally unrelated developments — just like the occupation of a part of a neighbouring country, sanctions, and the collapse of oil prices.\n\n  \nBabchenko's examples of inflating a frog with a straw, decapitating a puppy, pounding residential neighborhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction and shooting down passenger jets with SAMs fit like a glove when recalling what the Russians are openly doing in real-time to the Ukrainians.",

For some reason posts with a link to the article are routinely deleted even though the domain is not a Russian one.\n\nAnother good article on how crucial brutality is to the Russians and their self-regard comes from [an interview with various counterintelligence officers from the Baltic states](https://vsquare.org/baltic-counterintelligence-officers-russia-cruelty-war-history/) who started their careers in the KGB when the Russians were occupying their countries.\n\nLastly, there's a translated interview with Dmitry Titkov, a former associate of Navalny's, available on various Reddit posts. It was done with a Polish newspaper in February 2022, and he goes on to identify that a key element in Russian identity is the imperialistic self-entitlement to the destiny of **non**\\-Russians.\n\nHere's a snippet\n\n&gt;*When the war broke out, in Stockholm, where I am seeking asylum, Navalny's supporters decided to support Ukraine and march in front of the Russian embassy. There was a discussion whether to go there with a Russian flag. This proves that even if someone is an opponent of Putin, they still don't fully realise that it's not just about Putin. Ukrainians, Poles, Lithuanians, Chechens and Georgians understand me very well. In Russia, all the people are either asleep and only see what is in front of their noses and believe Putin's propaganda, or they are against Putin - but still remain within the imperial framework. When the question arises whether to trust Russians or not - I say: trust only those who no longer associate themselves with Russia, who want to learn other languages, who understand that Russia must fall apart, that it must cease to exist as an empire.*\n\n&gt;*I was born and raised in the Arkhangelsk region and I believe that there could be an Arkhangelsk Republic without any Moscow, culturally and economically integrated with Scandinavia. The Caucasus could also exist separately - and so on.*\n\n&gt;*Those who keep saying 'Russia will be happy', 'Russia will be free' - have not understood anything. Russia should no longer exist.*\n\nGoogle \"Titkov Russians have no sympathy\" to find the whole article. It's quite enlightening and refreshing since Titkov is one of the very few Russians out there who identifies that his compatriots and their foundational imperialism have been the problems, and not whatever excuse is used to blame non-Russians for whatever ails Russians. He didn't even spare himself since his interview includes how that ingrained Russian imperialism blinded him initially to how his non-Russian peers felt about his ethnic background.",

They must be protected by their different identities, traditions and religions and by their historical grievances against Muscovy\n\nIt's probably because they are not at the top of the caste system that has defined Russian society.\n\nOn the upper levels of the caste system are ethnic Russians with the richest and suitably сuсkеd and corrupted ones being at the very top. Furthermore, there's a socially-acceptable distinction in which an ethnic Russian from Moscow or St. Petersburg has more prestige than an ethnic Russian from elsewhere to say nothing about any **non**\\-Russian regardless of birthplace. Russian itself lexicalizes this distinction by using the terms *Русские* (Russkiye) to mean ethnic Russians and *Россияне* (Rossiyane) to refer to all citizens of Russia. In contrast, we in English use \"Russian(s)\" for both senses.\n\nBeing an ethnic minority in Russia elicits varying amounts of condescension, sometimes worsened or abetted by your hometown. On a somewhat related note, Volga Tatars are rather like a notably cynical variant of the \"model minority\" in Russia because of how their distinctiveness and relative demographic and socioeconomic success are used to play up ethnic Russians' \"tolerance\" all while still being tools of Russian imperialism. For example, after the Russians had goose-stepped their way into Crimea in 2014, [delegations of Volga Tatars went to Crimea to legitimize the Russians' re-annexation by spouting buІІѕhіt to the Crimean Tatars](https://jamestown.org/program/moscow-is-trying-to-weaken-crimean-tatar-resistance-with-the-help-of-tatarstan/) of how things wouldn't be *that* bad in Crimea under renewed Russian occupation.\n\nNote that Crimean Tatars and Volga Tatars are clearly related as Turkic people but their languages differ from each other roughly as much as Dutch does from Norwegian.",

The main reason for that huge expense is to be able to fight two major wars at the same time, and the only possible two wars are against Russia and China (since Mexico certainly isn’t going to invade any time soon)\n\nWell, the war with Russia is happening RIGHT NOW. And we can win it, without a single US soldier dying. It just takes sending (let’s say) half the current military budget to Ukraine - $500B would do the job (even if nobody else helped). Yes that would mean a lot of cuts to existing military programs. You know what? It doesn’t matter - in a world in which Russia is thoroughly crushed, the US can permanently reduce its military in half and save $500B per year forever. Purely from a money perspective that’s the deal of the century\n\nSecondly, the US already has insane stockpiles of gear. That wouldn’t be cash coming out of the budget, it’s a sunk cost, actually that gear takes a lot of money every year to store, and would take money to scrap. Sending it to Ukraine would be CHEAPER than scrapping it. For example US has literally thousands of ATACMS in storage which are expired, and would cost money to dispose of safely. Why NOT send all of them to Ukraine?",

He said he was also trying to arrange the purchase of another Patriot battery by Ukraine. While the actions and words from his administration about Ukraine have been incredibly schizophrenic, I do think this represents a real change for Trump as he is finally realizing there is no negotiating with Putin about the war, and that he and Putin don't have a real relationship. While I wish that this whole thing would have been less pathetically predictable and transparently about Trump's ego rather than what is right, I'm still glad that the US finally seems to be moving in the right direction.\n* On that note, the sanctions bill against Russia now has very significant momentum in Congress, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune saying it could even be passed this month. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also expressed support for the bill this week, which I don't think he had done before. When this bill gets passed (not if), it will turn Russia's already bad economic situation into a potentially catastrophic one. \n* Germany has released more details on its massive rearmament plan. They want to buy 1,000 tanks, thousands more APCs and IFVs, and large quantities of other crucial military equipment. By comparison, Germany currently has just under 300 tanks in its military, so this would triple that number. The scale of this plan is quite significant and they are clearly taking this seriously after a long time of treating their military with contempt. Merz also said he wants to finance the purchasing of more Patriot systems for Ukraine. Germany has production facilities for Patriot missiles which means it's one of the only countries outside the US that can natively sustain a Patriot capability. \n* Bloomberg reported that Russia is resorting to confiscating property from businesses in order to sustain its war effort since their oil revenues are declining so much. They have supposedly stolen almost $50 billion dollars from their own people this way. \n* Another Bloomberg report says that the EU is considering budgeting over $120 billion dollars in aid for Ukraine over the next 7 years. They are also looking at different ways they can fill the $19 billion budget gap that Ukraine is projected to have next year. \n* Russia keeps hitting Ukraine very hard with larger and larger drone and missile strikes, last night's attack was the biggest yet. Unfortunately each week sees larger attacks. Extensive damage was done in Kyiv and also in western Ukraine. \n* Ukraine is working on ways to counter this threat, however, especially with cheaply manufactured interceptor drones which can do the work of air defense missiles with a much smaller footprint and for far less money. They are rapidly scaling up production of these drones, which could be a real game changer for air defense against other drones. \n* The Economist published new estimates on casualties and deaths for Russia and Ukraine during the war. They say that since May 1 alone, 31,000 Russians have been killed. In total, they estimate between 900,000 and 1.3 million Russian casualties (killed + wounded), and 190,000 to 350,000 killed. For Ukraine, they estimate 73,000 to 140,000 total deaths in the war. These are shocking numbers. \n* Russia is allegedly planning on importing tens of thousands more North Korean troops to man their border with Ukraine, freeing up Russian troops to be sent into the country and fight on the front line. \n* Both sides have begun widespread use of drones with autonomous terminal guidance systems that allow them to attack targets on their own, limiting the ability of electronic warfare efforts to hinder them. I personally think autonomously targeted drones are an enormous threat to the human race, but I understand that in this war, you can't really take the moral high ground at the cost of your own soldier's lives. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,295 (+45)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,065 (+16)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,054 (+9)\n* Russian SPG losses: 956 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 338 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+2)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,292 (+18)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,210 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,409 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1004 (+4)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 590 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nNot sure if Oryx simply hasn't done much updating this week or something, but these are some of the lowest vehicle loss numbers, if not the absolute lowest, I've seen in almost two years of these updates, which is quite strange considering that there is heavy combat happening all over the front. \n\nThank you for reading!",

The problem though, Putin comes from the soviet era, where showing any weakness, ever, means you won't be respected, and could lose that power. Trump, a business man, thinks leverage is in the negotiation, where he's used to intimidating people with his shallow world salad and financial bravado. Putin, by nature, cannot agree to or even appear to even consider negotiating with Trump, or he will lose all respect, and become a target. They're both con men, but Putin has actually given out orders to have people killed in order to show everyone else that he isn't to be crossed, while Trump has just continuously tried to cozy up to Putin in the hopes that Putin will show him \"American\" respect. He's only now figuring out that he will never get that kind of respect, and his feelings are hurt. That's it.

Currently, only Moscow rejects this proposal, as well as all other peace proposals.\n\nWe will continue to build global solidarity so that diplomacy can still work.\n\nI especially thanked the Pope for supporting Ukrainian children, particularly those returned from Russian captivity. Ukrainian children have the opportunity for rehabilitation and rest in Italy, and such hospitality and sincerity are extremely important. Today, we discussed further efforts by the Vatican to return Ukrainian children kidnapped by Russia.\n\nI told His Holiness about the respect in Ukrainian society for the figure of Andrey Sheptytsky, his deeds, including saving Jews during World War II and defending the Christian faith. We hope that the contribution and merits of Metropolitan Sheptytsky will receive due recognition.\n\nI invited the Pope to visit Ukraine.”",

Watching Na'Vi, ceh9, and Dendi inspired an entire generation. While we didn’t end up on the pro esports stage, we chose another path **game development**.\n\nAround 8 years ago, I began working on a Source 2 mod that would reimagine Counter-Strike as a **top-down tactical shooter**. I recreated everything from scratch — the gunplay, economy, sounds, and iconic maps like Inferno, de\\_dust, pool\\_day, and office. People laughed. Then came 200,000 players. Then Valve reached out. Garry Newman (Garry’s Mod) supported the project. A top 10 Steam studio offered partnership. A Canadian company even tried to acquire the game.\n\nWe were gaining traction fast…  \nThen came the full-scale invasion.\n\nI lost friends. My family had to flee to Poland. Everything stopped. But not forever.\n\n**Today, Polystrike is back** reimagined as a **standalone, original game**, no longer bound by the Counter-Strike IP. We’ve built an incredible team:  \n– A former artist from Valve  \n– An art director who worked on Warhammer, Company of Heroes, Medal of Honor, and Need for Speed  \n– Developers from Starfield, Mafia III, PoE2, C&amp;C, and more\n\nThere are now over **20 of us**, and we’re more committed than ever.\n\nThis isn’t just a game it’s **Ukraine’s answer to the global tactical shooter genre**.  \nWe’ve launched our community: [r/POLYSTRIKE](https://www.reddit.com/r/POLYSTRIKE)  \nA new teaser is coming soon and we’d love for you to be part of it.\n\nThis project is more than just gameplay. It's proof that **even during war**, despite loss and exile, Ukrainians can build, create, and inspire. We're making this **from Ukraine for the world**.\n\nNot just known for Stalker and Cossacks **we’re building what’s next**.\n\nJoin us. Support us. Let’s show what Ukrainian devs are capable of.\n\n**Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦**",

As the war in Ukraine drags on and tensions escalate in Asia, many smaller or non-aligned countries, including Malaysia, are left to confront an uncomfortable truth: neutrality may no longer be enough.\n\n“To be really neutral is very difficult in the world, which is not stable,” says Denys Mykhailiuk, Ukraine’s acting ambassador to Malaysia.\n\n“Strategic neutrality is typically reserved for strong states that can defend their sovereignty. For many in the Global South, what is described as neutrality is more accurately a form of non-alignment,” he said.\n\nMalaysia, traditionally proud of its non-aligned foreign policy, continues to engage with all parties. Yet experts suggest this approach demands closer scrutiny in an era where global powers are increasingly acting outside international norms.\n\nPS - I've seen analysts/researchers on this matter saying that KL is being a hypocrite by being \"close\" to Russia despite... things that happened to the country.",

I don’t believe there’s anything he could say that’s too outlandish for his followers to believe.\n\nHe could say the Moon is made of cheese, and these fucking morons would complain that the “Deep State” is artificially inflating cheese prices by hiding all the Moon cheese from us because… well, they won’t have an answer for *why* anyone would do that; it’s just what the “evil Deep State” *does*. If he were to come out as a flat-Earther tomorrow, we’d have his supporters storming NASA and demanding that they tell us why they’re lying about the shape of the Earth.\n\nSo I’m not surprised that the Russian Puppet-in-Chief is claiming he’s “helping a lot” when, in fact, his administration has consistently stopped or stalled assistance to Ukraine, undermined their security, and misrepresented the facts of this war since day one.

That trip sounds incredible and huge respect for learning Ukrainian! even a little bit means a lot here \n\nдякую (diakuiu) - thanks :)\n\nSince it’s July, here’s how I’d plan things out based on your goals:\n\nLandscapes, lakes, and mountain vibes in Ukraine (without snow)\n\nIf you want to enjoy nature without everything being snow-covered, summer to early autumn (July–October) is perfect. Right now (July), everything is super green and blooming, and the Carpathians are honestly magical.\n\nPlaces I’d recommend:\n\n* Synevyr Lake - just beautiful like in a fairytale \n* Bakota – I've done stand-up paddle boarding there. amaziiiing\n\nCloser to Kyiv:\n\n* Trukhaniv Island \n* Zhukiv Island\n\nYou can find more ideas like this on [visitkyiv.com](https://visitkyiv.com) — it's a non-commercial guide with local tips, walking routes, and cafés we've visited ourselves.\n\n❄️ But what about snow and winter stuff?\n\nIf you want to ski, ice skate on lakes, and catch that true winter fairytale vibe, plan for January or February in Western Ukraine. That’s when snow is reliable and lakes may freeze over (just check local ice safety updates, of course). In Ukraine, Bukovel is the main ski resort. A bit crowded and expensive, but it works well. For a more local feel, places like Slavske or Dragobrat are fun and cheaper (I prefer Slavske and Dragobrat)\n\nUkrainian is super appreciated — even a few words like “Pryvit” (hi) or “Diakuiu” (thank you) go a long way.\n\nHope this helps you plan! And if you pass through Kyiv, we have walking routes and favorite cafés mapped out on [visitkyiv.com](https://visitkyiv.com) in case you want to explore the city a bit too. Safe and responsible travels!\n\nOlena",

He served in the Pokrovsk direction and has been considered missing since December 9, 2024. As of now, she has no further information.\n\n“The last time I spoke with my husband was the evening of December 6, 2024. He told me they were going out on a mission — maybe for 10 days, maybe longer — and that he wouldn’t have any connection. He said he’d call me himself. We said goodbye, and he told me, ‘As long as you pray for me, I have wings on my back. I’m not cold,’” \n\nNataliia is waiting for her son Vladyslav, who served in the 71st Brigade and is considered missing in action.\n\n“There is absolutely no information about him. He disappeared in Kurakhove while serving with the 71st. My dear son, we are all waiting for you — your mother, grandmother, brother. Come back, son, I can’t live without you. I need you,” she said.\n\nVeronika’s husband disappeared seven months ago. Officially, he is listed as missing in action, but she believes he is in captivity.\n\n“The command says he’s missing. He’s not listed among the prisoners or the dead. But we have information that he was taken captive. There’s a video showing 16 soldiers surrendering, two of them badly wounded. According to his comrades, my husband was gravely injured. We think that he’s the one being carried in that video,” Veronika shared.\n\nInna’s father served in the 44th Mechanized Brigade and is also considered missing.\n\n“The brigade hasn’t provided any official information. From the first day he went missing, russian soldiers have been contacting us with contradictory stories, mostly saying he died. But there’s no photo or video proof,” she said.",

Our guys defended Soledar and Bakhmut. Since September 2023, there’s been almost no information — no POWs, no confirmed fallen. Most are listed as ‘missing.’ We ask the government and all relevant institutions to do everything possible to find our loved ones.

Honestly, it's very cool and inspiring when people with Ukrainian roots want to reconnect and learn the language, explore the culture, and meet people.\n\nIvano-Frankivsk is a beautiful city with a strong sense of community. There is a place called Promprylad, it's something like a hub for coworking, dance classes, local cafes, and cultural events. [https://www.instagram.com/promprylad/](https://www.instagram.com/promprylad/) It resembles a mini version of Lviv, but has its own very warm and creative energy.\n\nIf you don't speak Ukrainian very well yet, don't worry. People are usually very open, especially if you show that you are trying. In smaller towns and villages, English is less common, but Google Translate or ChatGPT will help you get by. \n\nI'm from Kyiv, and I understand what it's like to miss a place that feels like home, even if you've never lived there. But I wouldn't rush into things like citizenship or permanent residency. If you have the opportunity to come for 3-6 months (depending on your visa/residence status), it can be a great way to try it out, to live here, explore, meet people, and see if this place is right for you.\n\nAlso, in case you ever find yourself in Kyiv, a few friends and I run a small non-commercial project called [visitkyiv.com](http://visitkyiv.com)  It is a local guide created by people who love and live (or have lived) in Kyiv, with personal itineraries, places we trust, and thoughts on how the city feels during the war. We will be happy if you visit us and share your thoughts\n\nGood luck on whatever path you choose. If you ever want to talk, DM me.

Photo:* [*DutchNews.nl*](http://DutchNews.nl)\n\nSanctions against Russia must be stepped up because of the country’s alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine, Dutch caretaker defense minister Ruben Brekelmans said in a briefing to MPs on Friday.\n\nBased on unnamed sources, Dutch intelligence services MIVD and AIVD and the German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) said the Russian army had used illegal chemical substances in Ukraine over 9,000 times.\n\nThe chemicals used include chloropicrin, which is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)  signed by 198 countries in 1993, including Russia.\n\nIn an interview with the NRC, Brekelmans called the use of chloropicrin, which was first used in warfare by the German army during World War I, “horrifying” and “unacceptable”.\n\n“We see that Russia is prepared to ignore all international norms,” he told the paper.\n\nAt least three Ukrainian soldiers have died after coming into contact with chloropicrin, and 2,500 needed treatment. The number of “indirect deaths” is probably higher, Brekelmans said.\n\nChloropicrin, dropped by drones, is used to flush out soldiers from the trenches so they become easy targets.\n\nThe Dutch accusation comes at a time when Ukraine is facing ammunition shortages due to a worldwide lack of Patriot air defense system rockets.\n\nProduction must be increased, Brekelmans said. “Last week, we announced we would be sending 100 radar systems to detect drones. (..) We will also continue to sens ammunition for the F-16s, which play an important part in Ukrainian air defense.”",

The parents weren't phased. They thought he had really good aim for his age.\n\n\n\nThis observation reminds me of what another Russian, Аrkаdiу Ваbсhеnkо, described as his people's ingrained **infantilism**.\n\n\n\n&gt;If you asked me to characterise the “Russian World” (Russky mir) in one word, I would not hesitate to call it infantilism. This term best describes the current state of Russian society.\n\n&gt;**Infantilism is, first and foremost, the inability to take responsibility for one’s own actions; the inability to draw causal links and to understand that such-and-such actions lead to such-and-such consequences.**\n\n&gt;It is an infantile directness in perceiving the world. The world of an infant is utterly simple:\n\n&gt;“The Аmеrісаnѕ let the price of oil fall. The Аmеrісаnѕ organised a revolution in Ukraine. Аmеrіса hаtеѕ Russians. Because of this, they sent us Јеwѕ and ІіbеrаІѕ. And the Јеwіѕh Rоtеnbеrg brоthеrѕ stole all the money. But Putin is good.”\n\n&gt;There is no place for any semitones or complicated intellectual constructions in this world. Its main characteristics is primitiveness.\n\n&gt;Its cruelty is equally infantile. Usually, adults do not reach to such levels of hatred, aggression, and willingness to inflict damage, hurt, or do wrong without cause.\n\n&gt;In the adult world, — with its families, children, and responsibilities, — such behaviour is not customary. There is a system of checks and balances. Such deeds are excesses. Only infants can fall into such a state of cruelty and change their target of hatred so suddenly.\n\n&gt;The absolute lack of understanding of the value of life is just as infantile.\n\n&gt;It is not acceptable for adults to inflate a frog with a straw, to decapitate a puppy, to pound residential neighbourhoods with weapons of indiscriminate destruction, or to shoot down passenger jets with surface-to-air missiles while thinking:\n\n&gt;“What difference does it make whether it was a passenger jet or not? The birdie is down, hooray! We did warn them not to fly in our skies!”\n\n&gt;The failure to grasp the value of life, including one’s own, is perhaps the main characteristics of an infantile person. In addition to the lack of any logical thinking.\n\n&gt;That is a world where causal links are broken, where actions and consequences are not related in any manner, and where throwing eggs from the window and a cuff on the ear are two totally unrelated developments — just like the occupation of a part of a neighbouring country, sanctions, and the collapse of oil prices.\n\nThe Russians are practically irredeemable until they prove otherwise. That is something that has happened in *vanishingly few instances* out of a pool of the more than 140 million direct descendants of the Golden Horde's staunchest ~~collaborators~~ bootlickers.\n\nIt's a sucker's game to give the benefit of the doubt to the Russians when they have taken it as a national characteristic to upend, invalidate, or even destroy, the norms of non-Russians and the rest of the civilized world.",

Perhaps not such sheep as you think.\n\nThe Russians **choked**.\n\nIt's striking how other nations which revolted against tyrants did not retain the widespread cruelty and depraved urge that underpins a centuries-old lust for a jihad-like imperialism.\n\nThere's a reason that the Russians have coped with their glaring civic ineptitude with the dark joke of \"and then it got worse\".\n\nJust because some incarnation of a Russian empire collapsed doesn't mean that the fundamental leadership principles for that empire ever changed. In this case, the Russians have come to define themselves as a nation that *needs* autocracy/absolute monarchy, or even totalitarianism, for its own good.\n\nIn contrast, democracy or even genuinely representative multi-party government is dangerously chaotic and \"un-Russian\". This is a big reason how Russian dissidents repeatedly go *nowhere* because so many of their ethnic kin regularly chicken out or lose their ѕhіt once they start to realize that they need to take responsibility for themselves and their choices, and learn to trust each other, never mind foreigners, to make any societal progress.\n\nInstead, their unholy hybrid society of a caste system with an extractive economy is functionally the same as when generation after generation of their ancestors chose to be the most loyal *bitсhеѕ* of the Khan of the Golden Horde.",

And Ukraine being a good land invites more immigrants to work the land.\nSo when you have these nations that are full of diverse cultures and ideas, those ideas and cultures mix and promote innovations - as new ideas and world views expand on each other. Ancient Rome did this through conquest, HRE,  Islamic and Byzantine empires did this through Religios influence, USA did this though welcoming immigrants (and a lot of people fleeing europe in 30s and operation paperclip in 40s).",

You have to teach them yourself have to read/write and maths. Complete opposite to the Netherlands, where I am from. Then at age 6, the hammer hits you right in the face when school expects your kid to read/write and know at least some maths. Of course, it's \"alright\" if your kid doesn't but there is a somewhat firm recommendation for the parents to fix this before going to school.\n\nYes, school starts at age 6!\n\nIn my opinion, the Ukrainian school system and kindergarten are extremely outdated. Even (NUS) the new Ukrainian system is not that great. Our son is in the intellect group so we knew it would be lots of homework and parent tutoring but I didn't expect him to be finished at 12 every day from school... Basically it's impossible to work and have kids because of this. After school hours daycare is only if both parents officially work..

    "selftext": "Yesterday, POLITICO broke that the Pentagon paused some shipments of ammo to Ukraine. The decision, driven by the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, is claimed by DoD to be in response to concerns about their own stockpiles.\n\nIs that true? No. It is not.\n\nDepartment of Defense stocks of a wide variety of munitions are undoubtedly depleted due to the War in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, but the devil is always in the details. POLITICO reports that the pause has impacted both deliveries under PDA &amp; USAI.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36h579z53kaf1.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68c204c2747d5c747a619b2de05402c2eb06439c\n\n  \nPDA (Presidential Drawdown Authority) is the mechanism for delivery of defense articles to Ukraine from DoD stocks. USAI (Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative) allows for the procurement of defense articles from industry or partner countries.\n\nDeliveries from past Drawdowns authorized by the Biden Admin have long been expected to conclude this summer. Sec Def Hegseth recently stated that they are currently executing on PDAs #71-74, implying that previous PDA execute orders have been completed.\n\nDeliveries from USAI, if allowed to proceed unmolested, would continue for years to come. As of December, there was still $10 billion in committed funding that was still not obligated (put on contract). I'd be surprised if this has substantially changed since then.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/liyzug4b3kaf1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a08691704d4548bc34a76bace513cde20ae3e450\n\n\n\nWe now come to what specific munitions have been held up due to these supposed concerns about the DoD's own depleted inventory levels. The weapons are sitting in Poland, and NPR has acquired an exact list of whats being held back.\n\n92 AIM-7 Sparrow missiles  \n30 PAC-3 MSEs  \n8496 155mm rounds  \n142 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles  \n252 GMLRS  \n25 Stinger missiles  \n125 AT-4 recoilless anti-tank guns\n\nThis is a very modest list of ammunition; nothing that is going to compromise the DoD's own readiness. AIM-7 in particular is scarcely used by US fighter aircraft, if at all. MSE was not included in PDAs 71-74, meaning it is coming via USAI and not US stocks.\n\nHellfire, which was not previously known to be provided to Ukraine by the US, has not been procured since 2023/2024 due to inventory requirements being met. The only item on the list that is likely having an impact on inventory requirements are the 252 GMLRS.\n\nGMLRS is interesting because there have been anecdotes from Ukraine observing a recent increase in GMLRS fire missions. This is likely due to the first lot of contracted GMLRS via USAI being delivered this year. That first lot (FY23) is scheduled to conclude next month.\n\nWith Lockheed Martin producing 14,000 GMLRS per year, the US Army can afford to give up 250 more from their inventory now; assuming that all of them are from inventory, and not a mix of both PDA &amp; new production from USAI.\n\nThis decision is just another example of Trump Admin officials actively working against the President's own agenda. At the NATO summit he pledged to work on sourcing additional PATRIOT assets for Ukraine, and scored a big win with the Alliance adopting the 5% target.\n\nAny delay to the delivery of what has previously been promised to Ukraine is going to impact confidence in the United States as a supplier of arms to allies &amp; partners. With the OMB sabotaging Trump's desire to see a strong military, the US needs those arms sales badly.\n\nThis is all beyond Hegseth's comprehension though. Whereas Bridge and Vought are malicious actors, deliberately sabotaging both Ukraine and the entire Department of Defense under false pretenses. This isn't about the US' own readiness, its about harming Ukraine.\n\nOne important detail in POLITICO's piece that has gone overlooked is this:\n\n\"The drawdowns from current stockpiles have continued under the Trump administration, which has been using up the last of the $61 billion in funding to replenish U.S. stocks of weapons\"\n\nThere is no evidence that the Trump Admin has committed any of the $5.2 billion in PDA replacement funding that remained as of December. The Pentagon Comptroller has only published 1 technical correction to previous reprogramming actions since January 20.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uabg59we3kaf1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0fc0420a787d6030bb94171cd152f4ea299d7e3\n\nIf there is such concern about the Department giving too much ammo to Ukraine, why are they not using the $5 billion sitting on the shelf to fix that problem? Moreover, why haven't they asked for more money?\n\nThe DoD is still actually tens of billions of dollars in the hole on Ukraine replacement requirements. The Biden Admin never requested enough money for that purpose, so even if the Trump Admin doesn't send 1 new bullet, they need to ask Congress for more money.\n\nBut again, the civilian leadership at the DoD doesn't care about this. They aren't interested in fixing the actual problems. They are only making things worse for themselves, Ukraine, and all of the US' other allies. We can only hope that Bridge and Hegseth are overruled.\n\n[Source](https://x.com/ColbyBadhwar/status/1940504676476375060)",

(Russia-Ukraine war),\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nPeskov's comments came after Politico reported that the U.S. Defense Department has paused shipments of key air defense and precision munitions to Ukraine over concerns about declining U.S. stockpiles.\n\nAmong the withheld items are Patriot air defense missiles, precision artillery rounds, Hellfire missiles, and other munitions used by Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Charge d'Affaires John Ginkel on July 2 to voice concern over the reported pause in weapons shipments.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa warned during the meeting that \"any delay or hesitation in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities will only encourage Russia to continue war and terror, rather than pursue peace.\"\n\nAccording to Politico, Pentagon policy chief Elbridge Colby ordered the halt in June following a review of U.S. ammunition levels. The White House confirmed the decision, saying it was part of a broader reassessment of American military aid to foreign partners.\n\n\"(The decision) was made to put America's interests first following a DOD review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,\" White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement.\n\nThe move comes as Ukraine faces intensifying Russian attacks. In June, Russia launched a record 5,337 Shahed-type attack drones at Ukrainian targets, the highest monthly total since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe U.S. has not approved any new military aid packages after U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also signaled that future U.S. defense budgets will reduce the scale of assistance to Ukraine.",

The U.S. Navy is looking to employing patriot aboard ship to reduce cost and limited availability of SM-3 and SM-6 missiles.\nNATO analyst recognizes production challenges (France samp-t and aster missiles are hopelessly expensive and complex to produce in any meaningful numbers). Germany has difficulty in scaling up iris/t systems as does Britain.  The trump policy  may be “trying to negotiate while rearming”.  I would hope, at least, (talk while you are low on supply and can’t ship anyway.)",

The European NATO needs Ukraine just as much if not more than Ukranians need NATO. I want peace, true peace for you - similarly to how we could breathe easier in the Baltics for at least a few years after 2004 accession into it. And being in NATO could hopefully bring you closer to that. But as it stands, Ukranian defence and strategic innovation, plus modern warfare experience is I'd think unmatched by any NATO country. I think having you in NATO would only end up making the entire continent safer for it. What we do have is bigger economies and more modern equipment we should be supporting you with. If we get into gear with sanctions, military and other kind of support, help you *win* this and pave the way towards NATO accession - the entire Europe will be safer for it.\n\nWe need each other I suppose my point is.

        "body": "So far I see at least 3 issues, which may not be too problematic, depending on how you see it. Although, with enough political will and public pressure, the likelihood of transfer might increase. IMO the challenges are more technical and logistical in nature. (Reminder: Take this with a grain of salt)\n\n1. Parts and Equipment\n\nA. The Warrior is a pretty old IFV, and the spare parts aren't exactly in abundance. There are however, at least 300 + units (out of the 600), and the least serviceable can at least be used to support the more functional ones. Even 150 functional units is already a massive boon to any Brigade that would need them. Though it is an IFV, it is isn't exactly on par with more venerable Bradleys and CV-90s, in terms of protection, battlefield awareness and target acquisition as well as protection, at least more or less only close to the Dutch YPR-65 IFV, an upgraded version of the M113.  \n\n\nB. The IFV (the more common version) has an issue with its primary armament, a non stabilized 3 round clip reloading 30 mm RARDEN cannon (meaning accuracy problems while moving and has to reload every 3 rounds), as it was designed in 1966 and produced in 1970s. While there are units that have undergone upgrades to the turret and cannon, the primary autocannon is a problem, although Ukraine can make the modifications themselves, perhaps adapting their own indigenous turrets like the *¹BM-7 Parus used by their BTR-4 Bucephalus, and adapted to their older BMP-1 and BMP-2, replacing their original turrets, or the *²M113 Remote Control Weapon system with a lighter armament\n\n2. Training and Organization\n\nA new weapon system requires not only require good logistics but also dedicated combat and maintenance crews. While maybe not as sophisticated as the Bradley or the CV-90, time is still needed to successful familiarize, let alone master the vehicle. Not only that but also time is also needed in integrating them as part of the brigades, especially as part of combined arms tactics and doctrines. Despite this, the Warrior may not be as complex as more modern and upgraded IFVs, and given the speed of Ukrainians in, at least, handling the basics, I don't it would too much of a hassle for them, given their tendency to quick learning and wit. Plus having extra armored vehicles boosts confidence amongst the troops and increases their chances of survival. \n\n3. Transportation and Delivery\n\nThis might be the more concerning in terms of issues regarding the transfer, (or at least being presented as such). Hauling even 300 units of these IFVs present a logistical challenge of transporting them from the British Isles to mainland Europe. Unless Britain really has problems with its logistics capabilities or in terms of funding, there shouldn't be a technical and logistical problem, as Sweden managed to deliver 200 of their older PVB 302s APCs , which are now in service in some of the Ukrainian Brigades. Like I said, unless there are really technical problems like the quality of remaining units and transportation issues, this is more of political rather than logisitical problem. \n\n*¹ The BM-7 Parus is a locally designed turret, accommodating a variety of weapons, including a 30 mm stabilized autocannon, a 7.62 mm machine gun, an ATGM Pod, and (smoke) grenade launchers.\n\n*² M113 Ukrainian designed RCWS turret is equipped with a 14.5 mm Heavy Machine gun, with a secondary 7.62 mm machine gun.",

Around 22% of Russians are under the age of 18 so they would not be called up to fight either. So roughly 40 million Russian men that could be called up for war exist outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. That's a large number but majority of male Russians tend to be older than the ideal age of a soldier. How many of those are actually physically or mentally fit enough to fight is questionable. Plus how many of them have fled the country or are in hiding. \n\nAnother problem would be replacing those men with other workers. Women could but if they have a job already there would still be a vacancy. North Korea is supposedly sending thousands of workers so there is already a strain on the factories, workshops, and whatever else those North Koreans would work at. \n\nRussia's demographics are very messed up and Putin is sending hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths and even more will be permanently injured. This combined with losses from world war ll, Stalin's purges and the Russian revolution are devastating. Whole generations have been destroyed. Russian women are having fewer and fewer children. By the end of the century the UN predicts the population will fall 25 to 50 percent from the current population of 146 million. \n\nOf course Russia could say we're just sending everyone outside of Moscow and St Petersburg. Gender and age doesn't matter, but the signs are already there they're struggling with a smaller workforce and doing something like that could be what finally tips Russia over the point of no return",

I have med supplies on hand to send to people in this exact situation. He received some and then immediately needed them when he was hit by an FPV. A Ukrainian teammate used those supplies to save his life. He is seriously injured but alive; he was wearing soft armor that prevented him from injuries to his upper body and he had enough tourniquets and bandages for his legs.\n\nThe supplies he got were donated through this fund and brought over by volunteers from Ukraine Frontline. [u/UFL\\_Robin](https://www.reddit.com/user/UFL_Robin/) hauled the gauze that treated him. UFL gets discounted pricing in the USA which means far more supplies for less money. If PAV has supplies on hand in Ukraine, we can get them to people who need them by the next day.",

    "selftext": "From the Danish MOD (Machine translated)\n\nNote: 500 million DKK = *€*67 Million\n\n&gt;Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen and the Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov have signed an agreement to support Ukrainian defence companies' establishment of production in Denmark. The government has reserved DKK 500 million for efforts to strengthen the establishment of Ukrainian companies in Denmark.\n\n&gt;“Denmark is leading the way by giving Ukrainian defence companies the opportunity to start production in Denmark. The agreement will form the basis for close cooperation between Danish and Ukrainian defence companies. At the same time, it will give the Danish defence easier access to some of the latest technologies and experiences from Ukraine. In this way, the integration of our defence industries will be of great benefit to the security and combat power of both countries,” says Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen.\n\n&gt;“The agreement marks a next important step in the new ‘Build-with-Ukraine initiative’, which I announced at the last meeting in the Ramstein format. I am pleased that Ukraine is launching this next phase with Denmark, which is one of our closest partners and which has contributed billions to support Ukraine's security, as well as created growth in our defence industry through the Danish Model. The agreement forms the foundation for Danish-Ukrainian cooperation in the next decades,” says Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov.\n\n&gt;The Danish and Ukrainian defence ministers signed the agreement in connection with the NATO summit in The Hague.\n\n&gt;“The horrors of Putin know no bounds. Denmark has been standing shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainians since the beginning of the war. And now we are once again showing that the Danish support continues unabated. We live in a troubled time where it is absolutely vital that we have a strong defence industry. With the agreement, we are getting a big step closer to being able to fulfil the great potential of the Danish defence industry. For on a sad background, the Ukrainian defence industry has gained many valuable experiences that our own defense industry can now even more easily benefit from when we welcome the Ukrainians on Danish soil. This is a major contribution to Ukraine’s freedom struggle as well as the Danish and European armament,” says Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs Morten Bødskov.\n\n&gt;In the current security policy situation, there is a need to ensure the construction of new facilities and supply chains in Europe in order to strengthen Denmark's and Europe's overall combat power. By the establishment of Ukrainian companies in Denmark, the Ministry of Defence in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry, Business and Foreign Affairs will ensure a higher degree of integration of Ukraine into the European defence industry.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, the most important experience collection and technology development in the defence industry is taking place in these years on the basis of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\n&gt;“It is on a sad background that the Ukrainians with a tremendous speed and skillful innovation force have managed to build and scale their defense production. Denmark has since Russia's invasion in 2022 been behind Ukraine and provided significant military, civilian and financial support for Ukraine. Denmark continues, and with Ukrainian defence companies in Denmark, we are intensifying cooperation for the benefit of security in both Ukraine and the rest of Europe,” says Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen.\n\n&gt;",

    "selftext": "EDIT - appreciate the upvotes, but I really need help  \n  \nHi everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out with a personal request and hope someone here can help.\n\nI’m from Croatia, and I met the love of my life my amazing girlfriend from Ukraine. We live together in Croatia, and I’ve started learning Ukrainian, but I’m still not good at it.\n\nI want to propose to her this summer. She and her family are very traditional, and I know it’s important to her that I ask her parents for permission. Sadly, because of the war, I won’t be able to meet her father in person for now. But her mother is visiting us in a few weeks, and I want to give her a letter something she can read and also share with her husband where I ask for their daughter’s hand in marriage.\n\nI’ve written the letter in Croatian and English, and I used ChatGPT to translate it into Ukrainian, but I know it’s not perfect. That’s why I’m turning to this subreddit.\n\nWould any native Ukrainian speakers be willing to help me by reviewing and improving the translation? I can message you the letter directly. I want to make sure it's respectful, sincere, and sounds natural and that ChatGPT did not butcher it.\n\nThank you so much in advance this means the world to me.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nПривіт усім,  \nЗвертаюся до вас з особистим проханням і дуже сподіваюся, що хтось тут зможе допомогти.\n\nЯ з Хорватії, і я зустрів любов усього свого життя — мою чудову дівчину з України. Ми живемо разом у Хорватії, і я почав вивчати українську, але поки що ще не дуже добре нею володію.\n\nЦього літа я хочу зробити їй пропозицію. Вона та її родина дуже традиційні, і я знаю, як важливо для неї, щоб я попросив у її батьків дозволу. На жаль, через війну я не зможу особисто зустрітися з її батьком найближчим часом. Але її мама приїжджає до нас через кілька тижнів, і я хочу дати їй лист — щоби вона могла його прочитати й поділитися з чоловіком. У цьому листі я прошу дозволу на шлюб з їхньою донькою.\n\nЯ написав лист хорватською та англійською мовами, а український переклад зробив за допомогою ChatGPT, але розумію, що він, можливо, не ідеальний. Саме тому я звертаюся до цього сабреддіта.\n\nЧи міг би хтось із носіїв української мови допомогти мені перевірити та вдосконалити переклад? Я можу надіслати листа в приватні повідомлення. Мені дуже важливо, щоб він звучав щиро, природно та з повагою — і щоб ChatGPT нічого не зіпсував.\n\nНаперед дуже дякую — для мене це справді багато значить.",

Anything that doesn't look right is something you can improve in the Ukrainian version of your letter, until the intended meaning can survive translation back into your own language. \n\n\nI'm not sure how well this would work with ChatGPT, but I can tell you it works with Translate, so try both.\n\n\nFinally, for any Ukrainian word you need help understanding, conjugating (for verbs), declining (for nouns), Wiktionary is often a good reference for that, if the word you need is in there. Just be aware that it's case sensitive, and conjugated verbs or declined nouns can only be found through full text search, because the page title will be in the infinitive form. If you try to use Wiktionary to help yourself construct sentences, I think it's more likely to sound unnatural than stuff that comes from Google Translate or LLM output, but you'll learn more from doing that, and it can help you deconstruct and make sense of automated translations.\n\n\nIf, after all this, you still struggle to find help from a Ukrainian, another lifehack I'd suggest is to volunteer for ENGin: your student will almost certainly be willing to help you with your letter.\n\n\nGood luck, and Слава Україні!",

    "selftext": "On June 24, 2025, the Dutch government announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth approximately €175 million. The support includes 100 advanced drone detection radars, 20 (partially) unmanned casualty evacuation vehicles (Ermine CASEVAC), and an additional €80 million contribution to the international drone coalition. This package highlights the growing focus on unmanned systems and aerial defense in Ukraine’s war effort.\n\nThe 100 drone detection radars are designed to detect hostile drones and relay their location to air defense systems, allowing them to neutralize threats effectively. The delivery of these systems is expected to be completed before the end of 2025. These radars will significantly enhance Ukraine's capacity to protect its airspace against relentless Russian aerial attacks.\n\nThe package also includes 20 modular CASEVAC vehicles, which can be used to evacuate wounded soldiers from the battlefield—some of which operate without a crew, improving safety in active conflict zones.\n\nIn addition to the €175 million in direct support, the Netherlands recently signed contracts worth €500 million with the Ukrainian defense industry for the production of **600,000 drones**. This massive manufacturing agreement—known as the *Drone Line Initiative*—aims to rapidly boost Ukraine’s frontline capabilities. These drones are seen as critical in preventing Russian forces from gaining ground.\n\nDutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans stressed the urgency of bolstering air defense, stating: *“The ruthless daily Russian air attacks show just how vital aerial protection is for Ukraine’s survival.”* He also highlighted the shift towards supporting Ukraine through drone technology and unmanned systems as a key focus of Dutch aid.\n\nThis new aid package comes on top of a previously announced €400 million package for maritime security and a prior €20 million Dutch contribution to the drone coalition—raising the total Dutch drone-related support to €100 million.\n\nThe Netherlands has consistently played a leading role in supporting Ukraine since the start of the war, now ongoing for more than 3.5 years. Minister Brekelmans emphasized unwavering Dutch solidarity, praising the resilience and courage of the Ukrainian people and calling continued support *“the best way to halt Russia’s brutal expansionism.”*\n\n  \nSource: [https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/06/24/100-dronedetectieradars-in-nieuw-steunpakket-voor-oekraine](https://www.defensie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/06/24/100-dronedetectieradars-in-nieuw-steunpakket-voor-oekraine)",

At least our towns and cities aren't being leveled by rockets and drones and our civilians aren't being indiscriminately massacred by a foreign invader (yet). The challenge we have is getting enough Americans to grow some balls (you know, balls of Ukrainium like the heroes in Ukraine have) and rise up against this clown show. If we could just stop fighting one another and unite as Americans against the billionaire oligarchs and the technofascists and Christofascists who want to control us and rob us blind, I guarantee the scumbags would scurry back into their holes.

        "body": "**Why “Kyi”?**\n\nThe call sign “Kyi” has a double meaning. First, my last name ends with that syllable. Second, I’m from Kyiv, I was born and raised there, and I worked in Kyiv until the full-scale invasion began.\n\n**Before the War**\n\nDespite past sad experiences with russians, I believed - perhaps naively as an international law graduate - that full-scale war in the 21st century was impossible. I imagined trade disputes, maybe, but not this.\n\nI have two higher education degrees—one in international law and the other in accounting and taxation. I worked in top international law firms that advised multinational companies on tax law, antitrust, intellectual property, and corporate law. Those things now feel infinitely far from what I do today, but back then, they were my world.\n\n**Do You Plan to Return to Law?**\n\nI do plan to return. I don’t see myself as a career military officer. I hope I can eventually reintegrate into civilian life. It won’t be easy; even on leave, the gap between military and civilian life feels enormous.\n\n**Did You Have Any Military Training Before the Invasion?**\n\nHonestly, I never even wanted to serve.\n\nI started as the duty officer at the command center. Then I was promoted—first to deputy chief of staff, and for the past three months, I’ve served as deputy battalion commander.\n\nThe chief of staff is the commander’s right hand. I guess I’m the left. I need to understand the situation in the battalion as well as the commander does. I inspect positions, run drills, talk with the troops to ensure we’re not fooling ourselves with false reports. I listen to concerns, hear suggestions, and help organize effective combat work. I also handle documentation, safety protocols, and internal oversight.\n\n**Before the War, You Spoke Russian**\n\nYes. Even though I could work and speak fluently in Ukrainian, at home I spoke Russian. But after the first missile strikes on Kyiv, my wife and I agreed - no more. I haven’t spoken Russian since. I switched my writing to Ukrainian too.\n\n**What Was the Moment You Decided to Enlist?**\n\nIt’s hard to pinpoint. I often think I should’ve volunteered in 2014, but I didn’t believe it would come to this. In 2022, when I saw Kyiv bombed, it felt apocalyptic—like my entire life was being erased. I was overwhelmed at first. Then came rage. “Are we really going to let them do this?” I didn’t think much beyond that. I knew I’d have a tough conversation with my wife—but I went with my friend Volodymyr to enlist.\n\nWould I do it again? Yes. I couldn’t live with myself, hiding somewhere, knowing the fate of my country was being decided without me.\n\n**But We Need Reinforcements**\n\nWe need rotation. Those who’ve been serving for four years should have the right to step back and become reservists. Some say “let the MPs or judges serve,” but I say - we need people. If you're afraid of the recruitment office, come to us. We’ll introduce you to your future commander and explain everything.\n\n[https://suspilne.media/ternopil/1045935-a-b-ce-zrobiv-znovu-istoria-urista-z-kieva-akij-dolucivsa-do-zsu-na-ternopilsini/](https://suspilne.media/ternopil/1045935-a-b-ce-zrobiv-znovu-istoria-urista-z-kieva-akij-dolucivsa-do-zsu-na-ternopilsini/)",

It's a good, educated, and quite valid perspective.\n\nBut I think I can help point out the subtle flaw at work here.\n\nKyi understands — correctly, I reiterate — that in the 21st century full-scale war is *utterly insane*.  That is the part that they get correct.  With that slight restatement, they are right on the money.\n\nWars such as Russia's invasions of Ukraine are utter madness.  Complete folly.\n\nWhat happens next is where the subtle fallacy lies.  And it's a fallacy that many people have made, entirely in good faith.\n\nThe fallacy is this:  *If something is utterly insanely self-destructive, that means that therefore no one will ever do it*.\n\nThat is how we go from (correctly) understanding the insanity of war, to (incorrectly) concluding that therefore it won't happen.\n\nThe problem that Putin posed for so many people is that they do not account for how utterly fucked up and insanely mass-murder-suicidal some people, and some peoples, can be.\n\nHopefully we will now remember.",

In Putin's case, against all those who, in his mind, betrayed his beloved Soviet Union.  I see that as an underrated aspect of his personal motivation.  He not only doesn't care if lots of Russians die — in fact it's hard to explain his actions unless you consider that he might very well actively wish for lots of Russians to die.

Make no mistake, Ukraine has outperformed by leaps and bounds. But even in the best case scenario for Russia if they took Kyiv, they were looking at over a decades worth of occupation and terrorism before marching home. If the Americans had issues with Iraq and Afghanistan, the outcome for Russia/Ukraine would be far more difficult.\n\nIt is logical to say, \"this was a dumb idea.\" The week leading up to the invasion where I heard of Visas getting denied, I still said, \"this is a dumb idea.\" And 3 years after, its clear that Putin is keeping this war going because he has no off ramp. He cannot delivery any semblance of victory to his people. If the war ends tomorrow, he will be thrown out of a window by the very people he sent off to war. \n\nAnd he will never deliver any semblance of victory to his people.

    "selftext": "I found this useful for understanding my own biases, and I think it could be very useful when discussing the war with liberal minded folk like myself. I've run it through an AI translator that I think did an excellent job.\n\nOriginal: [https://trafo.hypotheses.org/52570](https://trafo.hypotheses.org/52570)\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe Angry Ukrainian Syndrome: Injustice and Stereotypes About War and Peace\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nBy Olena Komar\n\n  \n\n\nIn this article, I demonstrate a series of biases against Ukrainians in Western countries, which I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome” (by analogy with the “North African syndrome”). These prejudices have emerged due to how Ukrainians speak about the war and how they are perceived in connection with Western European stereotypical expectations. Furthermore, these prejudices have a colonial nature, stemming from an inability to see Ukrainians as an independent people, distinct from Russians. This bias is reinforced by historical short-sightedness, influenced by pro-Russian sentiment in Slavic studies as well as by pseudo-pacifism.\n\n  \n\n\nPseudo-pacifism is the tendency of those not under threat not only to deny assistance to those facing annihilation under the pretext of not escalating violence but also to shift the blame onto the victims—denying them the right to self-determination and the capacity to make informed decisions about their fate. These prejudices are also a form of epistemic injustice, which must be confronted by rooting out ignorance. Such ignorance can be intentional, serving the interests of the oppressor by sustaining misunderstanding of the experience and suffering of the oppressed.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are several levels of epistemic injustice:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Stereotyping Ukrainians’ struggle for survival and identity as a manifestation of belligerence;\n2. Rejection of war as a negative phenomenon is projected onto war victims—their experiences and emotions become unwanted. This leads to silencing or victimization;\n3. Injustice of testimony and gaslighting result from “blind spots” in people’s knowledge: a distrust of Ukrainians’ accounts and understanding of their own history and of Russians;\n4. Unjust equalization, coercion into peace and compromises that benefit only the aggressor.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nNegativity or Resistance to Oppression?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nA Ukrainian athlete refused to shake hands with a Russian athlete, Ukrainian writers declined to participate in a joint panel discussion with a Russian writer, and Ukrainian scholars protested against the idea of delegates from Russian universities participating in a conference.\n\n  \n\n\nHow do Western Europeans react to such news? Do they view these actions as legitimate, just, reasonable? Most often, such events escalate into scandals, and the Ukrainians involved are accused of xenophobia, racism, or nationalism, cruelty, aggression, and discrimination, because Ukrainians distrust talk about peace negotiations, refuse to build “bridges of friendship” between intellectuals, and their statements are interpreted as hate speech.\n\n  \n\n\nIs there something wrong with the Ukrainians themselves and how they deliver their messages? Or is the problem on the side of the listeners, in how they perceive these messages and their trust in the speakers? I want to draw attention here to the latter.\n\n  \n\n\nThe stereotypical perception of Ukrainians as angry, aggressive, belligerent, and perpetually dissatisfied plays into the hands of Russian propaganda, which tries to portray Ukrainians as simply “bad Russians.” In my opinion, without a proper understanding of hermeneutical injustice, the harm caused is likely to grow—reinforcing the formation of what I call the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat Are the Preconditions for This Argument, and Where Does the Term Come From?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI use this term by analogy with the one used by Frantz Fanon, who introduced the “North African Syndrome” in his essay of the same name. This is not a medical diagnosis but a prejudice held by French psychiatrists toward North African inhabitants. Modern science recognizes this syndrome as a manifestation of racist colonial bias—under which North Africans were seen as lazy or overly emotional.\n\n  \n\n\nThis viewpoint did not necessarily stem from malice on the part of individual doctors, but rather from stereotypical perceptions of Africans as mentally inferior and emotionally unstable—perceptions shaped by colonial attitudes. This bias arose unconsciously as a result of institutional instruction—but does that absolve the doctors from responsibility for their own ignorance?\n\n  \n\n\nModern science considers such ignorance blameworthy and irresponsible because, first, it could have been avoided and corrected through proper epistemic conduct, and second, it harms others and therefore is not innocent.\n\n  \n\n\nMany studies have been devoted to decolonizing knowledge and to the concept of “white optics” or “white ignorance,” which allows one to “not see” numerous discriminatory manifestations.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd yet there is still no clear understanding of the place of white Slavic peoples in Europe, who for much of the last few centuries have been more oppressed than oppressors.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe Lack of a Hermeneutical Perspective Toward Ukrainians\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe absence of a hermeneutical perspective regarding Ukrainians as Eastern Europeans who, for most of their history, were enslaved, restricted in rights, oppressed, or engaged in struggles against attempts at genocidal extermination has extremely harmful consequences for understanding the present-day Ukrainian condition.\n\n  \n\n\nImposing a Western European optic onto Ukrainians leads to dramatic distortions because Ukrainians historically have been neither a privileged part of the Western world with its colonialism, nor do they identify with the “Russian world” and its imperial ambitions.\n\n  \n\n\nAnti-colonial and anti-racist criticism also often misses the mark, since Ukrainians are not “white privileged oppressors.” Therefore, accusations of racism for helping Ukrainian refugees—which are often inflamed by Russian propaganda abroad—are deliberately divisive messages.\n\n  \n\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainians have never been perceived by the West as a distinct oppressed community, because they were viewed only through the Russian colonial optic as “the edge of Russia” or as “Little Russians.” This was reinforced by both the Soviet myth of the equality of brotherly republics and the Russian myth of the “younger brother.” The current rhetoric of the Russian regime toward Ukrainians is even worse, consisting of the total denial of Ukrainian subjectivity—as “bad Russians” or even as a “virus.”\n\n  \n\n\nAs a result, Ukrainian identity is extremely blurred in the Western European focus, and in many aspects—including language—there is a blind spot. For example, refugee assistance centers abroad default to offering help from Russian-speaking interpreters. This has led to Ukrainians becoming invisible and unheard in their uniqueness, and being perceived with prejudice or mistrust, while their epistemic status has been downgraded.\n\n  \n\n\nSince many Europeans are only now encountering Ukrainians personally for the first time, they often generalize and stereotype based on these interactions. This may give the impression that most Ukrainians are dissatisfied, negative, belligerent, and intolerant. But today’s image of Ukrainians is being shaped by the extraordinary circumstances of resisting an invasion—and by the world’s inadequate response to it—not by any “natural state” of Ukrainians themselves.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nBravery or Belligerence?\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAt the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, social media and lightboxes in European, U.S., and Canadian cities were flooded with the slogan: “Be brave like Ukraine.” The world was amazed by the courage with which Ukrainians resisted an enemy whose territory is over 28 times larger, whose population is five times greater, and whose military is the “second-largest army in the world,” equipped with nuclear weapons.\n\n  \n\n\nYet even this slogan faced criticism, with some saying it “normalizes” and “encourages” continuation of the war—something Europeans hoped never to see again. It’s easy to ignore a war in the center of Europe: just close your eyes to the Ukrainians who have brought their misfortune with them—or blame them for what’s happening.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nA Personal Anecdote\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n“My son, age 10, visibly tenses when I suggest adding a slide with a photo of the destroyed museum to his school presentation in Vienna about the Ukrainian artist Mariia Prymachenko. On February 25, 2022, the museum in the town of Ivankiv, which housed a collection of the artist’s paintings, was destroyed by the Russian army during their advance on Kyiv.\n\n  \n\n\nOf course, Austrian teachers and students will love Prymachenko’s fantastical animals, birds, and flowers—works admired by Pablo Picasso. They are colorful and joyful. But why should they see that the artist’s museum was destroyed by Russian soldiers? They might not even like that you mention “Russian”—there’s a Russian student in class, it might make him uncomfortable, and that could be labeled as ‘xenophobia.’”\n\n  \n\n\nEven a young child in primary school quickly learns that Ukrainians with “their war” do not fit the standards of pacifist countries—especially German-speaking ones.\n\n  \n\n\nAre our feelings forbidden? Of course not. Are they unwanted? Absolutely. Silencing doesn’t require coercion. The victim silences herself—having lost hope of being heard or fearing condemnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nEuropean Pacifism and the Rejection of Ukrainian Pain\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe pacifism of modern Germans and Austrians—their rejection of nationalism and aggression in any form—has a clear historical basis: a desire to forget and cleanse themselves after World War II from the image of a nation burdened with collective guilt for Nazi crimes or, at the very least, for their failure to resist evil.\n\n  \n\n\nThose who, more than anyone, should understand what Ukrainians feel today—once again victims of aggression—prefer not to reopen wounds of memory, even if that means ignoring the destruction of Ukrainians.\n\n  \n\n\nBut there is a huge difference between renouncing the idea of attacking other countries and denying others their right to defend themselves by any means available when they are attacked.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n“Kriegmüde” – War-Weary\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n“Kriegmüde” (literally “tired of war”) is a new German word I learned from a letter from another school. Europeans are tired of the war, of high prices, of helping refugees, and they ask us: “When will there be peace? Why don’t Ukrainians compromise?”\n\n  \n\n\nBut can Ukrainians afford to be tired of the war? Do they keep talking about it because they want it to continue?\n\n  \n\n\nSi vis pacem, para bellum — “If you want peace, prepare for war.” Peace will come through justice, not through compromise if that compromise is rotten.\n\n  \n\n\nAccording to Professor Margalit, author of On Compromise and Rotten Compromises, those compromises that preserve a regime of cruelty and humiliation are morally unacceptable—even in the name of peace.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThis Isn’t the First Time the West Has Looked Away\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThis is not the first time in world history that Western Europeans have not wanted to know about the destruction of Ukrainians by Russians.\n\n  \n\n\nAt present, “peace” for Ukraine on Russian terms means slow, systematic extermination, as has happened in previous periods of history. In his 1983 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe, Czech writer Milan Kundera—himself exiled because of Soviet aggression—criticized Western Europeans for not valuing what other Europeans were ready to die for.\n\n  \n\n\nHe wrote:\n\n  \n\n\n“One of the great European peoples (almost forty million Ukrainians) is slowly disappearing. And this immense, nearly unbelievable event is taking place, and the world does not notice it.”\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nAllies Stabbing in the Back\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nUkrainians are genuinely angered and frustrated by a number of topics related to false or misguided support from allies—especially when these same allies simultaneously express support for supposedly “good Russians” or try to build “bridges of friendship” with them.\n\n  \n\n\nSince the start of the full-scale war in 2022, many Western institutions—including universities and academies—have issued public statements that repeat the phrase:\n\n  \n\n\n“We support Ukrainians and brave Russians who oppose the war.”\n\n  \n\n\nBut this seemingly inclusive language is deeply flawed. First, it equates the aggressor and the victim. Second, it places the virtue label “brave” on Russians, while Ukrainians are merely pitied as victims. Third, it often borrows Ukrainian symbols to promote Russian Studies, which many Ukrainians perceive as an act of appropriation.\n\n  \n\n\nEven if well-intentioned, these gestures often backfire. Ukrainians feel betrayed, silenced, or spoken over. This is a form of gaslighting—and as scholar Rachel McKinnon explains, betrayal by an ally hurts especially deeply. It is compounded by “westsplaining” and “russsplaining”: imposing Western or Russian colonial views on Ukrainians, who are framed through Russian-dominated academic lenses.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nFalse Equivalence and Real Injustice\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nA disturbing example: the Finnish Migration Service housed Russian men avoiding mobilization in the same shelters as Ukrainian refugee women and children. This was traumatic and dangerous for the Ukrainian women—but it stemmed from an epistemic blind spot, a refusal to differentiate between the oppressed and the complicit.\n\n  \n\n\nThis kind of moral flattening continues in many forms:\n\n  \n\n\n* Demanding Ukrainian victims engage in panels with “brave Russians”\n* Framing the war as a “family conflict”\n* Calling for equal dialogue between an aggressor and their victim\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSuch gestures are not neutral. They entrench injustice. Real justice means amplifying Ukrainian voices, prioritizing the needs of the oppressed, and resisting narratives that “both-sides” the war.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat Real Parity Requires\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nEqual negotiations cannot occur until:\n\n  \n\n\n1. Full cessation of aggression and guarantees against future attacks\n2. Compensation for historical discrimination\n3. Transformation of social structures to eliminate injustice\n4. Affirmative support for the voices of the historically oppressed\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nOnly then can genuine parity be discussed. Otherwise, reconciliation efforts only entrench discrimination and deepen epistemic injustice.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nConclusion\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe literature on decolonizing knowledge and epistemic injustice is relatively new. Yet Ukraine remains almost a tabula rasa in that discourse.\n\n  \n\n\nWestern Europe faces a historic choice:\n\nEither to finally discover the real Ukraine—\n\nor to unwittingly assist Russian propaganda in cultivating the “Angry Ukrainian Syndrome.”\n\n",

I realized that what hurts and burns me at first horrified Europeans, but over time they got used to it. For me, these are the children of my friends sleeping on subway cars or in the bathroom. These are destroyed buildings on such familiar streets of my hometown. Cities where the tragedies of strangers are perceived as our own. Do you know what the scariest thing about tragedy is? Its routinization. Seven dead, five dead, ten wounded. Translated into English, it's just statistics. Sad statistics of Ukrainian life. Horror that is already perceived as the norm.\n\n&gt;The further I go, the less I believe they will understand us. No one will understand what it's like to stay up at night, covering children with your body. What it's like when it flies into your neighbors. How it blows out windows. How floors crumble. Life is falling apart like dust. They won't understand. Even such simple, obvious and terribly terrible things, not to mention more subtle matters.\n\n&gt;The other day, a new neighbor moved in next door to me. A young Russian woman. She was settled by the mayor's office of our town, under a social program, just like me. The only difference is that I ended up here because there is a war in my country. A war that her country unleashed. From which many people close to me died and are suffering. There is no war in her country (yet).\n\n&gt;I asked in the chat room of German volunteers who have been helping Ukrainian refugees all these years, and besides - refugees from everywhere, whether there are really refugees from Russia in our district, and even if so - is it normal to settle us next door, because it's not really okay with me. \n\n&gt;In response, I received a lot of interesting things, such as quotes from the textbook Leben in Deutschland - about tolerance, helping everyone who needs it, and that not all Russians are necessarily evil, and suddenly this is a good Russian and why shouldn't I check it out. And in general, for us refugees, to have conflicts - in the hostel for asylum seekers, Africans and Syrians are always fighting. What kind of people. \n\n&gt;And then I understood! “Whatsthedifference” (aka “kakayarazitsa”) - a universal phenomenon. And there is no point in explaining that Africans and Syrians are not in a state of military conflict, and that domestic quarrels have nothing to do with existential conflict. And in general, there is probably no point in explaining anything. That is why this post is in Ukrainian. Like the post quoted below. It is for my own people - those who will understand.\n\n&gt;\" Seven dead were found in the collapsed building. But that's not all. Andriy is standing in front of the house - under the concrete are his 11-year-old daughter Maria and his wife Svitlana. \n\n&gt;He smokes, drinks water, answers endless calls. And so it has been for more than seven hours. Someone hugs him, asks to talk for a minute. He refuses. \n\n&gt;He stands and crosses himself. \n\n&gt;Svitlana and Masha lived on the third floor. Now there is the most debris there and rescuers are removing layer by layer with their hands. \n\n&gt;The boys are running around - Masha's classmates. They are here with their parents, they lived in neighboring houses, which were also damaged. \n\n&gt;A Russian Iskander hit the house on Dorohozhychi after four in the morning. \n\n&gt;There was a resounding alarm, people were returning from shelters. Then the alarm went off again and in two minutes part of the house collapsed. \n\n&gt;Maria and Svitlana were found dead 12 hours after the explosion.",

Experience Ukraine/support the local economy but also 2. Evaluate if they would like to return after said trip to volunteer with humanitarian causes. However, during the discussion it came up that with heightened security measures in place, masks might be an issue. Whether at security checkpoints or on public transit or near public buildings associated with government functions.\n\n \n\n Also, as someone who follows Ukraine and and the war fairly closely, ive rarely if ever seen masks much these days, or have seen Ukrainian CC groups. (obviously the majority of people in the world don't mask or take precautions, to each their own). With that said, I was curious what the general attitude towards masks in the country are these days. (At least as an American from other Americans, ive run the gambit of support to neutrality to outright hostility for masking) \n\n  \nI'm trying to be help my friends prepare for the trip ( I unfortunately cant go :(  ), so any info on this topic would be much apricated!",

There's nothing wrong with it. \n\nMasks are still worn for occasional medical reasons (just like they were before Covid) because of stuff like tuberculosis (UA has some drug-resistant strains of TB). People in industry also wear them as dust masks, so they are in stores and available if you look around for them. You won't see people just walking down the street wearing them though.   \n  \nIf a cop checks your ID, they will want you to pull it down for a minute while doing so. You will also have to do that at border checks and while boarding the airplane. The rest of the time, meh - it's up to you. \n\nOverall, people in Ukraine seem to be more reactive than proactive with health stuff. Far more likely to \\*treat\\* infections than \\*prevent\\* infections (I say this as a medic comparing my experience there vs. the USA - in general, Ukrainians are FAR more into taking antibiotics than doing things like creating an aseptic medical workspace. Same goal, different methodology). This means that less of their life is burdened by preventative measures overall - but it also means they have the highest HIV rate in Europe, so the philosophy is not without flaws. \n\nFYI - there's a new Covid vaccine this year. Get it before traveling internationally - the newly-dominant strains of the virus are nowhere near as dangerous as the old ones, but it's still pretty damn unpleasant. Nobody wants to spend their vacation stuck in the hotel room coughing and ordering room service.",

I am from Poland and my destination is Romania, but I want to visit Lviv on my way and maybe also take a detour to the Kyiv. \n\nDo you think I'd be having a harder time catching a ride now, due to war? Is it hard or easy to hitch in Ukraine in general?\nDo you think there could be any problems at the outposts? Will I be welcomed as a traveller or frowned upon?\n\nI plan to spend a night or two in hostels in Lviv and Kyiv, but in general I want to sleep wild during my trip, I think it's legal in Ukraine but I'm not sure if it's safe and acceptable now. What's the situation regarding land mines near the Kyiv? Is it risky or forbidden to leave the road/enter woods, wilderness? I might even don't need to spend any night in wild if I catch a direct ride to a city.\n\nI believe curfew is a thing only in the bigger cities?

As for forests, it is prohibited to visit them in:\n\nKyiv; Cherkasy; Poltava; Volyn (the region borders Belarus); Vinnytsia (transit trails can be visited); Kharkiv; Sumy.\n\nIn addition, in Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions, it is possible to visit forests, but it is prohibited to enter them in passenger cars if there is no transit route through the forest.\n\n5. There are no problems with mines in populated areas and transport arteries. Not to mention closed areas or eastern regions. You can google the specific forest or interested area. It's ok if you find any recent activities.\n\n6.

Get the hostel before arrival, take your good time in Lvіv, then you can take the the short way - by buses or trains to Mukachevo or Chernivtsi, and then to Romanian border.

Since there is a lot of russian spies accross the country searching for military locations and equipment. This is seriose, and you should act wisely and seriousely as well. Drivers are also not recommended to pick up hitchiking passengers, again, due to possible actions by enemy reconnaissance groups.  \nThe situation with mines is very serious, especially in areas close to active combat zones.

    "author": "Freewhale98",
    "score": 506,
    "created_utc": "2025-06-20T10:41:22",
    "selftext": "On June 17, Russian media reported that North Korea will dispatch 1,000 military engineers and 5,000 construction personnel to aid in the reconstruction of Russia’s Kursk region. According to the reports, Sergey Shoigu, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, disclosed this to reporters after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during his visit to Pyongyang. Previously, North Korea had deployed 11,000 combat troops in October of last year and 4,000 more between January and February of this year to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. Including the new group of engineers and laborers, North Korea will have sent a total of 21,000 personnel to support Russia—deepening what analysts are calling a growing “honeymoon” phase in the North Korea–Russia alliance.\n\nShoigu stated that the engineering units would be involved in mine-clearing and reconstruction work in the Kursk region—a southern Russian territory that was temporarily captured by Ukraine during a counteroffensive in August 2023 but has since been largely reclaimed by Russian forces. He described the deployment as “a fraternal gesture from the people of North Korea and Chairman Kim Jong-un,” and noted that the work would begin soon.\n\nThe South Korean government is closely watching the situation, noting the potential for North Korea to gain additional economic benefits and military technology transfers through this reconstruction effort. A South Korean military official commented, “North Korea has already gained significant economic benefits from sending combat troops, and those benefits will likely increase through participation in post-war reconstruction,” adding that military tech transfers are also expected to accelerate.\n\n** Kim Jong-un Joins Reconstruction Projects—Further Tech Transfers Likely**\n\nSergey Shoigu has visited Pyongyang twice this month alone—on the 4th and again on the 17th. Russian media report that he was acting on a special directive from President Vladimir Putin. According to TASS and other outlets, Shoigu discussed the deployment of engineering personnel and ways to commemorate North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine during his recent meeting with Kim Jong-un.\n\nBecause this latest deployment involves engineers rather than combat troops, it is expected to generate steady and substantial economic gains for North Korea. Shin Beom-chul, former Vice Minister of South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense, stated, “Russia appears to have fulfilled its military needs from North Korea, and is now seeking help in reconstruction. Compensation for these efforts will likely go to North Korea.” He added that the relationship between Pyongyang and Moscow is shifting from purely military cooperation to economic collaboration. “North Korea’s support for Russia allows it to receive not only military technology but also economic aid—thus helping it circumvent the impact of international sanctions,” he explained. “This may weaken the bargaining power of the U.S. and South Korea in future negotiations on North Korea’s nuclear program.”\n\nAnalysts also suggest that North Korea, having gained wealth through its alliance with Russia, is unlikely to pursue better relations with the United States. One South Korean defense official noted, “Recently, Kim Jong-un rejected a personal letter from former U.S. President Donald Trump—likely to signal North Korea’s strategic bet on Russia and show the world that it no longer feels the need to rely on improving relations with the U.S.”\n\nNorth Korea has already gained considerable financial rewards from its troop deployments to the Ukraine war. According to Im Soo-ho, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Strategy, North Korea earned up to 1.8 trillion KRW (approx. $1.3 billion USD) annually from its first deployment, through salaries and enlistment bonuses. If North Korea participates in post-war reconstruction, its economic gains could exceed those from combat deployment alone.\n\nMilitary tech transfers from Russia to North Korea are also expected to speed up. Within the past year, North Korea has constructed two 5,000-ton class destroyers—Choe Hyon-ho and Kang Gun-ho—believed to be “North Korean Aegis destroyers” based on Russian radar and design technology. During a launch ceremony last month, the Kang Gun-ho reportedly capsized in front of Kim Jong-un, and repairs may now require Russian assistance.\n\nThe United Nations Multinational Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT) recently reported that Russia has provided various weapons and military technologies to North Korea in exchange for its troop support in Ukraine, constituting violations of UN Security Council resolutions. According to the MSMT, Russia transferred the Pantsir air defense system—designed to intercept drones—to North Korea in November 2024. \n\nRussia is also said to have handed over electronic warfare equipment and GPS-jamming technology, which North Korea has used to disrupt communications in South Korea, affecting cell towers, aircraft, and ships. Concerns are growing that these new capabilities may escalate North Korea’s electronic warfare provocations.\n\nRussia has reportedly transferred data and guidance technology related to ballistic missiles as well. North Korea has long struggled with reentry technology for its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), but this deficiency may now be addressed through Russian assistance. Last month, North Korea revealed a live-fire test of a new medium-range air-to-air missile, believed to incorporate Russian technology.",

Such a maneuver would not only betray our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty—it would corrode U.S. credibility and embolden authoritarian regimes worldwide. The stakes could not be higher.\n\nUkraine has demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression. Our NATO allies have stood resolute alongside them, affirming the principle that free nations have the right to chart their own destinies without coercion. Any attempt to force Ukraine into a deal on Putin's terms would strike at the heart of democracy, international law, and the collective security architecture the United States helped build and lead.\n\nThat is why I urge you to take immediate and decisive action to prevent any unilateral moves—by Trump or anyone else—that might compromise our alliances, appease authoritarianism, or undercut global security. Specifically, I ask you to:\n\n1. **Publicly reaffirm the United States’ commitment to NATO and to Ukraine’s sovereignty.** It is essential we send a clear, bipartisan message that America keeps its word—and stands with those who defend freedom.\n2. **Support legislation that strengthens congressional oversight of foreign policy,** preventing any administration from bypassing allies or making backroom deals that endanger global stability.\n3. **Advocate for sustained and expanded military and economic aid to Ukraine,** including lifting any remaining restrictions on the delivery of long-range weapons systems. Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength—not while one hand is tied behind its back.\n4. **Impose new, robust sanctions on Russia,** targeting sectors that continue to bankroll its war machine and signaling that aggression will be met with escalating consequences, not diplomatic reward.\n5. **Champion legislation that protects Ukrainian refugees and asylum seekers,** particularly in light of Trump’s radical anti-immigration agenda. No one fleeing Putin’s war should be subjected to deportation or bureaucratic purgatory in the United States.\n\nThe American people overwhelmingly support Ukraine’s fight for freedom. We cannot allow political expediency or authoritarian nostalgia to erode that support. History is watching—and the cost of appeasement is always paid in blood.\n\nThank you for your leadership and commitment to democratic values. I look forward to your response and to seeing bold, principled action on this issue.\n\n**Sincerely,**\n\n\\[Your Name\\]",

Which means that what older weapons US send to Ukraine they still charged for replacement value in the end. So only $20 billion in the bill was for **Military equipment.**\n\n&gt;A curious element is that the legislation requests $13.4 billion to replenish stockpiles but only $7.8 billion of new drawdown authority. This discrepancy implies a preexisting deficit, likely stemming from accounting changes [made](https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-war-weapons-surplus-funding-72eeb6119439146f1939d5b1973a44ef) last summer. The accounting changes priced equipment at the depreciated value rather than the replacement value. \n\nNot to mention they also added in this bill $7.3 billion for \"US forces in Europe\" and call it 'aid to Ukraine' and before anyone argue without reading the bill, it is not money for training, intel or other stuff, they are included separately in other categories of the bill.",

Firstly, these people are facing food shortage issues. Calorie dense foods would be more beneficial for those who can’t count on three square meals a day. Secondly, many of these refugees have young children. A food truck that offers items many children tend to turn their noses away from will add more stress to the life of a single mom with three or four young children. A food item that almost all children will readily eat is wholly appropriate here. Lastly, the smell of fries will attract crowds. This event is about giving people a reason to smile. It is meant to help them forget for a moment just how scary their lives are right now. A cup full of steamed broccoli won’t have the same psychological benefits.",

CYBERCOM has historically played a role in countering foreign interference, particularly from adversaries like Russia and China. The decision to end its participation could make U.S. elections more vulnerable to cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.\n\n&gt;The move is part of a broader agenda outlined in Project 2025, a policy framework developed by the Heritage Foundation. It argues that CYBERCOM’s involvement in election security is \"partisan\" and should be discontinued.\nCritics warn that this could empower foreign actors to manipulate U.S. elections and weaken national security. \n\n&gt;Additionally, Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly ordered CYBERCOM to halt all planning against Russia, including offensive cyber operations. This directive could significantly alter U.S. cyber defense strategies and limit responses to potential threats\n\nAnd finally Trump's top negotiator and advisor Steve witkoff doing this interview in mid april-[\"Trump's top negotiator says they are excited for commercial business opportunities with Putin soon.\" ](https://archive.is/20250416010920/https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-trump-negotiator-steve-witkoff-excited-about-commercial-opportunities-with-putin/) which is also why trump is only mad about the war currently, you can't conduct business in the open if it's ongoing and people hate Russia. How can people not see how this all equates to him most definitely being pretty damn intentional now?\n\n*edit, I forgot his ties to Russian mafia as well\n\n&gt;Starting in 2003, the Trump Organization worked with Felix Sater, who had a 1998 racketeering conviction for a $40 million stock fraud scheme orchestrated by the Russian mafia, and who had then become an informant against the mafia.[402][403] Trump's attorney has said that Sater worked with Trump scouting real estate opportunities, but was never formally employed.[404]\n\nHe also went to Russia in 1987 and wanted to build trump towers there and had his lawyers working on it, and tried hard to be accepted by the oligarchs. And now we have this as of June 5th-\n\n&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace, even as Germany’s new chancellor appealed to him as the “key person in the world” who could halt the bloodshed by pressuring Vladimir Putin.\n\n&gt;In an Oval Office meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the U.S. president likened the war in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in February 2022 — to a fight between two children who hate each other. Trump said that with children, “sometimes you’re better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart,” adding that he relayed the analogy to Putin in a call this week.\n\n&gt;“I said, ‘President, maybe you’re going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot,’ because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart, before they’re able to be pulled apart,” Trump said. “You see in hockey, you see it in sports. The referees let them go for a couple of seconds, let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”\n\n[the 2016 election was proven to be rigged ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/senate-panel-finds-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-us-election) by the Senate panel and the CIA. And by the way this Senate panel that confirmed the evidence was Republican based.\n\n&gt;The nearly 1,000-page report, the fifth and final one from the Republican-led Senate intelligence committee on the Russia investigation, details how Russia launched an aggressive effort to interfere in the election on Trump’s behalf. It says the Trump campaign chairman had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer and says other Trump associates were eager to exploit the Kremlin’s aid, particularly by maximizing the impact of the disclosure of Democratic emails hacked by Russian intelligence officers.\n\nRemember his [accusation in a mirror technique ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accusation_in_a_mirror#:~:text=The%20strategy%20was%20used%20by,d'Expansion%20et%20de%20Recrutement.) with the whole, \"Hillary and the emails?\" Yeah that's because he was doing that the whole time. \n\n\n *BUT,* instead of focusing on repercussions, they decided to do this instead -\n\n&gt;While Mueller’s was a criminal probe, the Senate investigation was a counterintelligence effort with the aim of ensuring that such interference wouldn’t happen again. The report issued several recommendations on that front, including that the FBI should do more to protect presidential campaigns from foreign interference.\n\n&gt;*updated to add this message on behalf of the USA to russia-[\"US Wishes ‘Happy Russia Day’ as Kremlin’s War Casualty Toll in Ukraine Surpasses 1 Million\" ](https://www.kyivpost.com/post/54394)\n\nFor anyone thinking this is bullshit, even the government in Canada touched on these issues in June recently and they called him out in very clear terms that he is a Russian asset.

We also had a big fight for independence from Mexico in the great battle of the 4th of July, amazing coincidence actually when you think about them winning that war on such an important holiday for Americans but that was a proud day for ICE wasn’t it, they say never to fight up hill but they fought everywhere, lots of hills, trenches, tree houses, boats, that was a big one for us lots of illegal immigrants were defeated and I think the fireworks in the background would have really made a noisy battle lots of dogs barking and you know they eat them, they eat the cats, all the pets even pet chickens and their babies before they had a chance to hatch. If I’d been president though you know what I would have done? It’s easy when you know what you’re doing. I’d have ended those wars in one day, less than a day, sleepy Joe Biden  had no idea what he was doing you don’t win wars with the radical left wanting to let people from mental asylums in the country raping and murdering while the soldiers are away and unable to knock the hell out of them.",

        "body": "“It was the beginning of the war, the ATO. I had to run around a bit with various volunteer battalions and bend the truth a little about my age. When the command found out I wasn’t 18 yet, it was too late to kick me out. And I had already achieved my goal — I was at war. At the time, it seemed completely right and logical to me. Crimea had just been seized, and we were preparing for partisan activity. One day, our trainer called us and told us to meet at a point. We built a checkpoint — it was the first Pavlohrad checkpoint,” Myroslav said.\n\n“My mom called me when I was in Opytne or Vodiane and asked me to tell the truth. I did — and her response surprised me. She gave me her blessing, you could say. She told me, ‘Take care of yourself and kill them,’” the soldier said.\n\nIn 2022, he was wounded in Popasna during a combat mission.\n\n“I was hit in the inner thigh — at least that’s what I thought at the time. It was almost a direct firefight with a tank. I was really lucky the shrapnel got stuck on the side. If it had been a centimeter higher, it would’ve hit an artery and I’d have bled out… There was only one ‘road of life’ to get out on foot. I walked eight kilometers with the shrapnel in my knee,” he said.\n\nAfter recovering, Myroslav returned to the front. He emphasized that people in the rear should not have to understand what life is like for soldiers on the front line.\n\n“People in Soledar or Bakhmut really understood us because they lived the same way — in the same basements, under the same bombs, with the same hunger, cold, and lack of basic conditions. Infantry bears the brunt of the first blow and fights this war so that people in the rear don’t have to understand what’s happening here,” he said.\n\nThe only thing he dreams about is that a year from now, things in his hometown won’t be worse than they are today.\n\n“That there won’t be Russian rags \\[flags\\] here, that they won’t rebuild Lenin statues. I dream that my city remains Ukrainian — that’s my only dream. That my family won’t have to flee west. I never imagined my city would be this close to the front. Now Pavlohrad is like Pokrovsk was during the ATO days. And that’s a bad thing. I dream that Russian soldiers won’t get even a kilometer closer,” Myroslav said.\n\n[https://suspilne.media/dnipro/977397-mriu-sob-moe-misto-lisilosa-ukrainskim-vijskovij-miroslav-z-pavlograda-akij-z-16-rokiv-na-fronti/](https://suspilne.media/dnipro/977397-mriu-sob-moe-misto-lisilosa-ukrainskim-vijskovij-miroslav-z-pavlograda-akij-z-16-rokiv-na-fronti/)",

When we first asked if anyone needed laptops every single team responded with yes we do. \n\nIf you have an extra laptop or tablet that you don't need, you can send that to Ukraine. We can accept them if they are in working condition that can connect to the internet. They will have new operating systems installed in Ukraine. If you have one reach out to [tech@protectavolunteer.com](mailto:tech@protectavolunteer.com) and a volunteer will help you arrange how to get it to us. Please be patient as coordinating shipments from around the world is a challenge. It also may take up to several weeks for them to arrive in Ukraine depending on the origin. \n\nIf your device is password protected, please either remove the password or put a sticky note with the password on the device. Don't worry if you don't have a charging cord. Those are easily replaced.\n\nThis video is the 80th Air Assault Brigade which defends the Sumy Oblast, where Russia is now amassing troops. They received two laptops and two tablets with keyboards.",

There was a very brief period, when Russia did its \"partial mobilization\" in 2022, when I thought there may be protests but no. It's not really just any one thing, it's a whole combination of factors.\n\nThere's the overall Russian culture of \"так там лучше знают\", \"как наверху решат\" - basically the belief that those in power know best and it's not the common person's place to decide anything. This isn't some Putin thing, it's an old approach that predates not just Putin but his grandfather as well.\n\nThere's the pervasive propaganda. In the first days of the invasion, Russia's last free newspaper, radio station and TV channel were shut down. If people aren't actively seeking out other information, and only passively consuming what the TV says, they won't hear about a million casualties. They'll hear about Russian heroes slowly but steadily advancing against hordes of Anglo-Saxon backed Nazis, with rare minor setbacks.\n\nThere's poverty and geographic dispersion. A million casualties is a lot. But Russia is a large country, the casualties are distributed throughout it, and mostly affect poor regions. Russia's poor regions are really, really poor. People in poor, remote rural towns have even less power than others if they did protest, and some are actually seeing a financial profit from the war because a soldier who survived a year on the front lines can afford much more than locals.\n\nThere's a totalitarian approach, imprisonment of anyone who objects. This is one of the biggest changes in Russia since 2022. Before that, it was dangerous to be an opposition politician or journalist, but you were pretty much safe as an average person voicing disagreement with Putin. Now, people are arrested and punished for any opposition to the war. Flowers at a Ukrainian monument? Arrest. Say \"stop the war\"? Arrest. Write a post online about Russia striking civilian targets? Arrest. All this has a strong chilling effect.\n\nAnyone who could be an organizer of protests or a rallying figure is imprisoned or killed. And if soldiers are unhappy, the Wagner rebellion showed that Russia knows how to deal with that, too - blow up the leader of the rebellion and the rest fall in line.\n\nI'd like to be proven wrong but I don't expect any sort of mass protests or opposition in Russia.",

The exception is Taiwan. And maybe India, but I'm quite confident that China won't start an occupation operation (military or not) against anyone but Taiwan. At least not within the next few years. China is a position that enables them to play such stuff much smarter, and I believe they will be smart. My opinion.

        "body": "Comment from u/GarlicThread\n\nI travelled to Ukraine during the war. Here is my perspective as a European who visited there :\n\n- Most of Ukraine is very safe. You are taking a risk by going of course, but it is in my opinion a quite mild risk statistically speaking. You can make yourself safer by getting the official air raid alert app and going to shelters if anything happens. If in doubt, follow Ukrainians ; they will always know what to do. Whatever happens, don't panic. Your first air raid sirens are gonna be stressful no matter how prepared you think you are ; it's not a normal feeling (or at least it shouldn't be, but for Ukrainians it has become normal unfortunately).\n\n- Ukraine's economy needs all the help it can get. Spending your money there financially helps Ukrainians in a very direct manner.\n\n- Ukraine's morale directly depends on foreign support. By showing up and showing you care, you are doing your part to let Ukrainians know they are not alone in this.\n\n- Make sure you respect all laws and do not under any circumstance capture footage or photographs of anything related to the military or the government, no matter how insignificant it may seem. When in doubt, do not photograph. Do not film or photograph air defense activity should you encounter any.\nBe curious. Many Ukrainians are eager to tell you about their country and answer your questions. Listening to them is a great way to bring back stories to tell your peers to educate them. But do not ever ask a Ukrainian whether they've lost someone in the war. The answer to that will obviously be yes with virtually everyone you will meet. You do not need to ask that question and frankly, I find it disrespectful and ignorant to do so.\n\n- There will never be a better time to visit Ukraine than right now. There are very few tourists obviously, so you'll get front-row seats to everything you visit. Seize that opportunity.\n\n- Maybe be a bit careful about placating your interest in Chornobyl. Some Ukrainians can be somewhat offended by foreigners who are fascinated by it just because they saw it in video games. Foreigners used to treat the place more as an extreme amusement park rather than a place of significant historical importance and pain for Ukraine. It's okay to be interested, but make sure that interest is healthy. Do not be like these people who visit Auschwitz just to take selfies on the train tracks with their Gucci bags.\n\n- Ukrainian food is amazing. Go visit restaurants that serve traditional food and make sure to get very addicted.\n\n- What you are doing is the opposite of insensitive. Insensitive would be to not care. You are showing you care extremely by making the effort to go there. Therefore you are not insensitive.\n\nAs for recommendations, I can only give some for Kyiv :\n- The Mother Ukraine statue at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, as well as the military vehicle museums you can find around.\n- Holodomor museum (check the opening days, it's not always open).\n- Babi Yar, the site of large-scale Nazi atrocities in Kyiv, nearby you can also find the Kyiv TV tower that shows damage sustained by russian missiles in 2022.\n- Saint Sophia Cathedral and Pechersk Lavra monastery.\n- Independance Square, where the Euromaidan protests took place, it features lots of memorials and even a painting by Banksy if you are observant enough.\n- Go have a walk around the government district. You cannot enter but it is impressive to see the military presence that protects it.\n\nThere are way too many places to list them all, but these are the main ones I would not miss on my first trip there. I hope you enjoy your trip to the fullest!",

No one thought I was special or brave either. I was pretty much ignored the whole time except when I was in direct conversation, meaning I didn’t get looked at by passersby. \n\nOnce at a cafe I sat next to a Polish American guy who, by the way he was talking with wait staff and what he was saying, really seemed to think he was special just for being there, what a peanut. \n\nEnglish is spoken a lot otherwise I used a translation app. Amazingly never missed a bus or a train and never got bombed. I was most nervous about Odesa and fluctuating intensity of ballistic missile strikes as the peace talks were happening in Turkey at that time. The second most recent heavy ballistic strike happened just after I left Kyiv- I was expecting it while I was still there. Some local who I met in the train leaving Ukraine came from Dnipro and they thought Dnipro was safer than Odesa, when I told them I went there. So many add Dnipro to your list.  \n\nMy trip - bus Chisinau to Odesa, 3 nights Odesa. Train to Kyiv, 5 nights. Train to Ternopil, bus to Kamyanets Podilski, bus to Ivano-frankivist, one night each.

It comes at a time when Ukraine’s leaders continue to navigate a complex relationship with the US, and just a few short months after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was humiliated in a now infamous White House news conference. Relations have improved since the signing of a minerals deal in April, but uncertainties remain about the US government’s attitude toward Ukraine and the longevity of its support.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Marchenko has to keep many balls in the air. He must help preserve his country’s financial infrastructure. He must ensure international donors and allies have confidence in where their money and other support goes. He must ensure the state has enough money to pay soldiers, doctors, teachers — and to buy weapons. And he must encourage investors, even in wartime. \n\n[*Read the full interview here for free*](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-sergii-marchenko-weekend-interview/?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0OTMwNzMzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5OTEyMTM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWEZDV0dEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2M0I1MDYzMjkwODY0OTRDQjIzMThFMDVCOTBGMkMwNiJ9.CAMWb-bsSTdg0hgEcbDy7wyg8VhNu8Gek55Lk3diax0)*.*",

This attack marks a new epoch in military history. Ukraine claims to have destroyed and damaged over 40 aircraft, including priceless, irreplaceable Tu-95 and Tu-22 bombers which Russia no longer has the ability to produce. So far satellite imagery has confirmed the destruction of at least 19 aircraft. There are many historic aspects of this attack, but one of the most significant is that this is the first time in history that a significant part of a nation's nuclear triad has been destroyed. This changes the game in term of Russia's nuclear deterrence on a global strategic level, as well as on the strategic level within Ukraine. While I've seen some legitimate questions about whether or not some of the planes destroyed were not being actively used, the fact that, as you can see in the video, the planes were fueled and went up in flames, at least some of them were being staged for a massive cruise missile attack that was due to begin on June 1st and has now been called off. I also want to highlight that two A-50 recon planes were also destroyed or heavily damaged in this attack, Russia only has a couple of those planes left now, and they are incredibly important for Russia's ability to see the entire battlefield.\n* Ukrainian special forces also detonated some kind of bomb under the Kerch straight bridge between Crimea and Russia. It's unclear how much damage was done to the bridge, but Russia claims traffic has already resumed, though they may be lying.\n* Trump then spoke on the phone with Putin and said on social media that Putin said he would retaliate, even as he gave zero indication that he had pushed back in any way on this.\n* Ukrainian forces claimed that for the first time they were able to destroy a Russian Iskander ballistic missile system. Russia uses these systems to strike Ukraine constantly, including an attack last week that killed 12 Ukrainian soldiers and injured 60 more. While the loss of one system is not necessarily a huge blow, these systems are kept deep behind the lines, so it's great that Ukraine has found a way to find and attack them.\n* House speaker Mike Johnson came out publicly in support of tough sanctions on Russia and said there was strong support in Congress for such a bill. Even as Trump completely abdicates any role he might play in bringing this bill up, there is such a strong desire in Congress for hurting Russia that this might happen without him.\n* Many different European nations have announced different big aid packages for Ukraine, with many of them focusing on providing funding for weapons production within Ukraine. Ukraine is also in talks with the US to use some of this money to buy American weapons under the terms of the minerals deal that was signed.\n* Russian casualties are nearing the awful milestone of 1 million, with likely 250,000 of these casualties being deaths, while the others are injured. This is a truly stunning number. Ukrainian casualties meanwhile are likely around 400,000, with just under 100,000 of these being deaths.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,045 (+77)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,037 (+8)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,011 (+14)\n* Russian SPG losses: 945 (+3)\n* Russian SAM losses: 334 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 155 (+14)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,067 (+50)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,195 (+1)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,385 (+9)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 958 (+9)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 566 (+5)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nLight losses on both sides, with the obvious caveat that Russia lost more aircraft confirmed on Oryx this week than at any time in the entire course of the war. In total during the war, Ukraine has now destroyed 11 Tu-22s, 8 Tu-95s, and 2 A-50s. Russia started with 57 Tu-22s, 55 Tu-95, and between 6 and 8 A-50s, so those are all significant percentages of the fleets, especially when you consider that even many active planes might not necessarily be operable.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Russia uses lots of drones and uses them effectively, they're the main threat to soldiers on both sides within several kilometers of the zero line.\n\nUkraine was well ahead on drones early on because drones were an unexpected, unconventional weapon. Russia invaded with a massive force, Ukraine wasn't receiving anything heavier than anti-tank launchers from the West, so had to improvise and try out various weapons. Some of the weapons from the first weeks of the war are long since irrelevant (like Bayraktars), but drones clearly turned out to be more effective than anyone anticipated. So Ukraine continued to improve at drone warfare and eventually Russia also started adopting drones as a key component.\n\nFiber optic drones, the latest major development, were first deployed by Russians, so they're not just catching up. I think it's even borderline insulting towards the Ukrainian defenders to pretend they're fighting some chaotic bunch of alcoholics with no technology. No, Ukraine is fighting a large hostile army that adapts to the battlefield. Russians clearly have a lot of organizational problems, and they're constantly following a strategy that treats soldier lives as very cheap, but it's not the same force as invaded in 2022. Russia knows how to use drones now. Russia doesn't have fifty-kilometer convoys getting stuck for a week without fuel. Russia no longer puts all the ammo for a brigade into one warehouse that can be blown up. Their overall strategy of using terror bombing against civilian targets hasn't changed. The strategy of taking major fortifications by throwing thousands of men at them head-on hasn't changed.",

    "selftext": "Russia is set to lose one million soldiers by the end of this summer. June 2025 is shaping up to be a disastrous month for Russia and its war against Ukraine — not only due to unprecedented drone attacks on strategic bombers and surveillance aircraft or sabotage on the Kerch Bridge, which have angered and alarmed the Kremlin.\n\nAs *The Economist* reports, by the end of the first summer month, Russia is likely to surpass one million troops killed or wounded. “The data suggest Russia is performing poorly on the battlefield,” experts write in the report. In Kharkiv, for example, Russian forces have been advancing at an average pace of just 50 meters per day — slower than British and French troops in World War I, who moved about 80 meters daily. According to author Seth G. Jones of CSIS, Russia’s campaign in Ukraine is on track to become one of the slowest offensive operations in modern warfare.\n\nBut the most shocking statistic is the scale of Russian casualties.\n\n“Russia is likely to reach the milestone of one million casualties in summer 2025 — a staggering and horrifying figure,” states the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). According to the think tank, around 250,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, and total casualties exceed 950,000.\n\nThis, the authors argue, reflects Putin’s blatant disregard for the lives of his troops. “Placed in historical context, Russia has suffered about five times more casualties in Ukraine than in all Russian and Soviet wars combined from the end of World War II until the full-scale invasion in 2022,” they add.\n\nCompared to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which lasted a decade, Russia’s losses in Ukraine are 15 times higher, and 10 times more than in the 13-year-long war in Chechnya. Increased Western support has only added to Russia’s burdens. According to the study, the most critical factors have been tactical missile systems (ATACMS), HIMARS rocket artillery, 155mm shells, air defense systems, and intelligence sharing. All of this has crippled Russia’s offensive — without the U.S. losing a single soldier.\n\nExperts argue that the issue isn’t whether the U.S. holds the cards, but that it hasn’t played them decisively enough — failing to apply real economic and military pressure. As the study concludes, “Without serious pain, Putin will continue to stall peace talks, prolong the fighting, and wait for the U.S. to back down.”\n\nPutin can afford these losses in part because many of the killed and wounded soldiers are from the Russian Far East or recruited from prisons — not, as the analysis notes, the sons of Moscow and St. Petersburg elites.\n\nFor Russia, the war in Ukraine is turning into a historic catastrophe — militarily, demographically, and geopolitically. The losses surpass those of all previous modern Russian conflicts and reveal a regime sinking deeper into isolation, unwilling to retreat even at the cost of massive human suffering.   \n  \nThe war is no longer about victory, but about the survival of a regimes, democracy and freedom.\n\nSource: www.csis.org",

Also according to zelensky russia are returning their own soldiers bodies to ukraine pretending theyre ukrainian fallen soldiers in military body swaps as another way to get rid of their soldiers. And they're already charging the new recruits big money \"for their equipment\" so they dont get paid what they were promised anyway.

After the Aghan war just a few tens of thousands of \"Afghanski's\" came back from wounded and mangled from that failed invasion. The burden on society is largely seen as one of the things that caused the soviet unions authoritarian regime to collapse. Imagine now, when Russia has less than half the population the soviet union did, now there are 100's of thousands of mangled and wounded men coming from an unjustified war of genocidal conquest that will be a humiliating defeat. Russia is going to get weighed down to death. Roughly 30x the casualties with .5 the population so 60x the problem you had after the afghan war. And this is still going. Thats if Russia stopped now. Meanwhile in all of the territories east of the Ural mountains in that vast space you use to claim you are the largest country, you have around 6 million poor and mistreated minorities with scattered ethnic russian who were moved there during the soviet days. Right across the border hundreds of millions of chinese citizens who need the fresh water and resources. Russia is grinding itself down on a front that it never was at risk at. So fucked right now.",

Although he sang so much before, oh so much.\n\nWe also do not observe any great joy from the European partners. Well, there are a few responses from those who do not decide anything, such as Boris Johnson, but in general there is a deep strategic silence.\n\nIt would seem, why not be happy? You were all so afraid of Russian nuclear weapons - well, we have reduced the number of aircraft that can launch these nuclear weapons by about 41 pieces. Targeting you too btw.\n\nAnd judging by the unidentified explosions in the port of Severomosk, where Russian nuclear submarines are located, the time is not far when these clay legs of the nuclear Colossus will also buckle thanks to Ukrainian ingenuity.\n\nThe question is - why aren't you happy that Ukraine found a way to strike at the Russian nuclear greatness that you were so afraid of?\n\nToday, The New York Times published an article that explains everything.\n\nIt turns out that they are all in deep shock, because everything has collapsed. The military was the first to speak.\n\n\"Ukraine has taken the war to a new level.\"\n\n\"Operation \"Web\" showed that it is possible to destroy an aircraft worth over $100 million with the help of a $600 drone.\"\n\nAnd not only an aircraft, we understand. Anything.\n\n\"According to a representative of the defense ministry of a European NATO country, Ukraine's strikes will obviously force allies to reconsider the vulnerability of their military facilities.\"\n\nYeah, right.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have shown that they can cheaply and effectively create in a matter of months what Western countries have been unable to create for decades for huge money.\"\n\nOf course.\n\n“We are gradually beginning to realize the threat that drones pose to American military bases located in many countries and regions of the world.”\n\nWOW, really?\n\n“These bases are unlikely to have protection against short-range weapons, and the lesson of the Ukrainian attack is that a strike on large bases, where many aircraft are located, can be launched at any time.”\n\nYou don’t say.\n\n“Moreover, Donald Trump’s $175 billion Golden Dome project, which is supposed to protect the United States from all types of missiles, including with the help of spacecraft, may turn out to be a waste of money,” - General Ben Hodges, former commander of the US Army in Europe.\n\nWell, one hit of an FPV drone on your spacecraft - and that’s it.\n\nAnd you know what the trick is, guys?\nYou did all this yourself. \n\nIt was your decision - to first take away all weapons from Ukraine, not just nuclear, but all of them, and leave it naked and barefoot in the face of its asshole neighbor.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the Russian invasion, it was your decision to give Ukraine as little weapons as possible, while the Russians were pelting us with every possible missile, bomb, and artillery, when the ratio of shells on the battlefield was 1 to 10.\n\nYou saw all this, and still came up with some lies, twisted formulations about escalation, and whatever else you wanted - just to not give Ukraine enough weapons - so as not to anger the Russians.\n\nIt was your decision - not to give Ukraine long-range missiles. You and the whole world watched as bombed Ukrainian cities bled, almost every day - new tragedies, new collapsed buildings, torn people on the streets, flowers and teddy bears on children's swings.\n\nYou looked at all this and helped only with words of \"deep concern\".\n\nUkrainians asked you, begged you: give us long-range weapons - to destroy their air bases, from where bombers take off.\n\nUkrainians sent to you a special diplomatic mission: here is a list, here - damn it, look: they brought a map, on the map - these military bases, which we will shoot at with your missiles.\n\nWe will not shoot at anything else, fuck the Kremlin, we want Russia to stop killing our people.\n\nNo. They did not give it.\n\nThey also mocked us. They gave long-range missiles, but they did not give permission to shoot them at Russia.\n\nAfter the strike on Okhmatdyt, when the Internet was flooded with photos of bloodied sick children, and all social networks exploded with rage with one single message: finally let Ukraine strike back! - no, they did not allow it.\n\nThe White House spokesman, then Biden's, came out that day, July 8, and said: \"Nothing has changed in our policy towards Ukraine.\"\n\nAnd now you wonder why Ukraine began to develop drones.\n\nA lot of its own drones. It began to improve them and bring them to a new level. Not only to fight with them on the front lines, but also to get these drones to Russian air bases, from where the fucking bombers take off, killing Ukrainians. And where it could not get them in any other way.\n\nThe Ukrainians have the right to destroy these bases and these bombers. And they have no other choice - they are forced to do it in order to survive.\n\nIf the Ukrainians had an immeasurable number of YOUR long-range missiles, then it would not have needed to develop Operation \"Spiderweb\", because it would have been slapping those missiles at Russian air bases.\n\nBut you didn’t give us missiles, and you can see how it turned out.\n\n“The Russian military will also draw conclusions and try to repeat similar operations in Ukraine or later in NATO countries, and Western militaries should be prepared for this,” military commentators say for The New York Times.\n\nAnd an Israeli military expert calls June 1, the day the operation was carried out, the beginning of a new era.\n\nBecause what Ukraine did is so cheap that almost any terrorist organization could do it – and believe me, they have countless ideas about what objects to attack there, in the West – both in the USA and in Europe.\n\nAny person with an average technical education and a 3D printer can make drones from shit and sticks bought on Amazon and organize such a coordinated attack.\n\nAnd now, the expert complains, Israel, the United States, Europe - they all need to completely change their strategy for protecting both civilian and military facilities.\n\nAll their bulky installations and machinery, which cost millions, turn out to be worthless in front of cheap drones.\n\nHere you go. \nAs the NAFO puppers say, the dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubricated.\n\nUkraine has changed the world again.\n\n(c) Nadia Palyvoda",

Ryan McBeth wrote about almost this exact scenario in his recent book, detailing how vulnerable military assets are within the borders of a country. Both the UK and the US have experienced suspicious drone activity, either attacking infrastructure or (potentially/alleged) sabotaging commercial travel. Over the last few years Finland, Sweden and Norway have all experienced similar threats to installations.\n\nNone of this should be a surprise to anyone, and the fact our governments have been caught with their pants down should lead to a thorough spanking.\n\nI'm not claiming no one in our governments/military had the common-sense to see this coming, or that they lacked the required imagination to be able to predict it, but clearly there has been some kind of lack of foresight/action here. Someone dropped the ball, and whether that's in the imagination stage, the assessment stage, or the development stage, those involved should all be embarrassed.\n\nAnd I'm fully with you, OP. If our stupid governments had done what they should have done at the start, this would have been over within a few months, and it wouldn't have reached this point. Instead, they forgot the phrase \"Necessity is the mother of invention\" and they forgot our own history in which we made remarkable developments during WW2.\n\nOur nations allowed this to continue, and this is the result. Our arrogant leaders underestimated Ukrainian abilities over and over and over again. Our nations have been historically so high on our own romanticized notions of historical heroism, we believe we're better than everyone else and didn't think Ukraine had the same abilities.\n\n(To clarify, I'm speaking of those in power. I think most citizens of our nations fully respect Ukrainian ingenuity and ability.)\n\nWell, now we're stuck in a difficult place where Ukraine has had no choice but to unleash a Pandora's Box of possibilities.\n\nAnd now I find myself wondering what else Ukraine has up its sleeve that the rest of the world will be surprised by. Will our leaders finally work out that we should help to end this now with conventional means, or will they again all sit back and deliver piecemeal nonsense, only to be shocked once more when Ukraine releases another \"unboxing\" video?\n\nSadly, given how stupid so many of those in power are - and have been for a long time - I fully expect them to do nothing again, and for them to be blind sided when Ukraine delivers another means of attack to the world that our so-called \"experts\" didn't have the intellect or imagination to predict.",

        "body": "I agree with what you are saying OP, and you've said exactly what I have felt since the day this war started. Plenty of us were screaming that Putin's nuclear threats 100% needed to be treated as a bluff. The day the Kharkiv offensive took place was the day the west should have flooded Ukraine with weapons to push the russians out once and for good. Instead, after the awe was over, the fear of eSCaLaTioN crept back. Those of us who were screaming for more, Zelensky included, were told repeatedly that the drip feeding policy was 100% fine and by doing this we are \"keeping the conflict contained so we do not have to send out children to die one day in the future\".\n\nExcept...that entire drip feed policy has crept us closer than ever to a world-wide conflict. I 100% believe that had Biden and his team shown some actual muscle and provided the FULL support Ukraine needed, the Dems could have used that as a launching pad for Harris to win the presidency. What a wave of patriotism that would be; finally the bad red army has been defeated, shamed and never allowed to invade another country again. All for pennies on the dollar, *not a single American soldier's life lost*, all handed on a silver platter. But now, we are stuck with a POTUS that has shit all over literally every single ally the USA has built over the past century, and he's not done yet. A weakened NATO that looks more fragile than ever where it seems like a given that the US will NOT come to the aid if called upon. The stability and leadership the USA has provided to the Western world is cracking and one day, some country somewhere will start some shit that will drag us all in, mark my words. What's that, talks of taking over Greenland or even f'ing Canada? I can't imagine Harris doing something like that. If only she had won, right?\n\nUkraine being given what they asked for, when the asked for it, being allowed to use it how they see fit would have resulted in conventional war staying exactly that way; conventional. Instead, we now get to witness the birth of the drone era of war in which the 2 countries that are by far the most advanced in that kind of warfare, get to test it in true battlefield scenarios. This isn't US drones chasing cavemen in mountains where 20 operators sit in a room and peacefully sip coffee while they launch attacks at a wedding. This is the future of war, of terrorism, on display and once again we can thank the policy of eSCaLaTioN management for allowing this kind of progress to be made. \n\nWhat I have learned is that if a nuclear-armed country wants nuclear proliferation to be a thing, you'd better step the fuck up and help other countries who have abided by your policy (in this case, Ukraine) of disarming and help them when they need it. And it should be done in such a way that other countries watch what happens and think twice before waving their own nukes around and invading another. A quick swift victory against the russians would have sent a strong message to China to think twice about about attacking Taiwan, lest you feel the swift axe of the west. Instead...it's a ticking time bomb and once again with Trump in power, it's not certain that the USA will come to Taiwan's rescue.\n\nAfter living in the aftermath of this attack on russia's nuclear bomber fleet, we can now use the power of hindsight to see just how the dominos have fallen ever since escalation management has led us to this stage. The frustrating part is that this was all entirely preventable, predictable, and those in power simply kept kicking the can down the road. The desire to keep your children and their children out of conflict, is in fact turned upside down, and for many it seems closer than ever. Especially for those that live within the sphere of American imperialist ambitions, and a fractured NATO alliance, thanks to a president who is very clearly on the Orc's side. One who would likely not be power right now had his predecessor shown more courage in the face of threats and shown his people that his side was worthy of their vote by defeating their eternal enemy, all for pennies on the dollar.",

So even though it's tempting to play on our noses towards ruzzia, it is not our place to do so.

Hats off to AFU&amp;SBU on execution but the idea? How tf are we shocked, again?     \nSince this year we've even changed the law to enforce authorizing all drone flights. There's a new fine and everything.  Our flight agency has the tool to set our drone's ass down or to return to point of start at moment's notice. But I've noticed multiple times in last weeks  that people fly over restricted zones and they don't call it in in Drone Tower and... nothing. Maybe someone seeks  the fine, but that's just silly afterthought that ought to be nothing more than deterrent. The real response should be forcing a landing, and then if you can't do that - that's when you know you're dealing with imminent danger. \n\n  \nThis  is one of the ways Ukrainians are helping to keep us safe - we get to adjust to these innovations without actively fighting a war which among other things makes command more rigid.  \n\nPS.: as a lazy motherfucker myself, I've got to wonder: what do you think your post achieves?

I'm even in favor of Ukraine getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it may be. I guess it's because I see a reflection of our suffering during WWII in your current suffering. It made us go \"never again\", getting nuclear weapons, as controversial as it was at the time, and pursuing a strategy of military autonomy up to this day, as controversial as it also has been.\n\nThat being said, I don't like being lumped together with the US under the umbrella term of \"The West\", and drawing blanket statement about us from it. Especially now that it's so fractured, with Trump saying things like \"The EU was created to screw over the US\", wanting to seize Canada and Greenland, it seems the US caught the fascist disease, like Russia.\n\nAnd for all that this term of \"The West\" is worth, Ukraine is now part of it, isn't it? Or at least part of the EU bloc as a Candidate country, which is more important than many realise. Ukraine's genius hasn't been only in the battlefield, but also in the political sphere. The Zelensky government has positioned Ukraine, not as a lesser country begging for missiles and external help, but as a hero of Europe, a leader and defender. Seemingly with the complicity and support of many EU leaders. Pretty much everyone in Europe now knows the motto of \"Slava Ukraini! Heroim Slava!\" This is rooted in the true glory of Ukraine, but I don't think it spread this far just by accident. Some even say that Ukraine is now the new leader of the \"Free World\", and in heart I agree.\n\nAs cruel as it may be in this cruel world, a \"self-actualised\" Ukraine doesn't get to complain about \"the West\". You are part of the West now, you are now the \"France of the East\", you are a leader who has to play with the hand you have been dealt with, we Europeans are the imperfect hand you have been given, but at least it's not \"you have no cards\" as the other would say.\n\nWe Europeans believed we achieved forever peace and mothballed our military. We were caught with our pants down. On the plus side, now that we are rearming, we can invest heavily in drone warfare just like Ukraine, you can guide us in that, we can together create the EU army of the future.\n\nWe have failed to provide you with enough weapons, but in many cases it wasn't that we were sitting on big stockpiles refusing to give it away, we didn't have much really.\n\nBut at least we have a lot of money lol, we've invested a lot of money in keeping Ukraine up and working, and in your military, to develop your own weapons, our weapons for the future.\n\nAs far as the EU is concerned, we depend on you as much as you depend on us. We are not the West as opposed to Ukraine. We are in this together. Your victories are our victories. If they are causing \"deep shock\" for the world, good. We are Europe, Europa Universalis.

For all of Americas accomplishments they have never really been under real stress. They don't get really exposed to war or privation. They don't really suffer poverty(American poverty is wealth in the rest of the world). In general, their lives are to good to make them fight for anything with any real risk to their lives.\n\nAs to governments... it's.. complicated.   \nIn every metric it is better to help Ukraine for the western world.. but there is also a few with real fear of Ukraine too at the heights of power. Ukraine could easily become Russia 2.0 in these peoples minds. Even if the concept is absurd to a Ukrainian the fear of a powerful unified nation with a modern army and a different way of thinking skews things. Then there is also the might makes right crowd that stupidly agrees with the Russian way of doing things. \n\nTLDR until the war hits home for Americans.. they'll continue to just be \"situationally interested\" for the greater majority.",

They've demonstrated that no part of the world is safe from this new form of hybrid warfare and that will shake the core of the great powers. \nThe second and related reason is the idea of mutually assured destruction. It relies on the fact that nuclear armed nations have the capacity to annihilate each other if a nuclear war were to start. This extends not only to nations nuclear arsenals, but also their defence against the nuclear arsenal of another nation. If you can demonstrate that you can defend yourself against a nuclear attack from another nation or you can pre-emptively cripple your adversaries arsenal before they're able to launch a strike it paradoxically moves the entire world closer to that precipice. Ukraine directly attacking the delivery systems of Russia's nuclear arsenal shows that not only their but also every nuclear armed nations arsenal is now vulnerable to relatively cheap and widely available weapons that smaller nations and even some terrorist groups are fully capable of utilising against them.

I’m not taking away from Ukraine, I believe we’re simply supplying/assisting and training.\n\n2. I really don’t like Trump and i’m livid at how he treated Zelensky. But isn’t the timing strange? Ukraine was likely pressured as we all witnessed, to be quiet and to not pull off any further substantial attacks. Especially ones that would seek to humiliate Putin which Ukraine is so damn good at. Trump wanted to be in full control of anything that might threaten peace talks.\nHowever after Ukraine signed the minerals deal and did all that Trump said, it became clear to Trump that Russia was the only one not playing ball. Something we all knew but he didn’t because he’s an idiot. \n\nI think because of this, Trump has given Ukraine the go ahead to start biting back again to force Putin to the table seriously. The issue is that Putin doesn’t want to legitimize Zelensky. He has paraded him on Russian media as a terrorist and an illigitimate leader. He also sees Zelensky as below him with no real power and therefore not his equal. He wants to discuss these talks with Trump and only Trump. If Zelensky and Putin are to be in the same room it would be with Trump. Putin is evil and very cunning.\n\nThe timings of the attack right before the 2nd round of talks is telling though. Especially since Russia snubbed the first round. They got a taste of their own medicine. You want strength and cunning power? Ukraine can rise to the occassion.\n\nLastly, this is just an opinion based on my observations. I say that because it is highly possible Ukraine just said “F this, Trump is getting us nowhere and it’s making things worse”. I just know that Zelensky has countless times put his own percieved image on the line for the US and Europe etc to politically/diplomatically get things done by the book so we are all kept on the right side of history and not stooping to Russia’s level of degenerecy, showing once again that our system of life is far superior despite it’s failings.\n\nGod Bless the Ukrainian people. 🇺🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿",
