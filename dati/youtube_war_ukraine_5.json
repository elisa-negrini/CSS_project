These countries jointly produced with the United States an initial 348 F-16s for their air forces. Final airframe assembly lines were located in Belgium and the Netherlands. The consortium's F-16s are assembled from components manufactured in all five countries. Belgium also provides final assembly of the F100 engine used in the European F-16s. Recently, Portugal joined the consortium. The long-term benefits of this program will be technology transfer among the nations producing the F-16, and a common-use aircraft for NATO nations. This program increases the supply and availability of repair parts in Europe and improves the F-16's combat readiness.",

Now, the Su-35 is a good aircraft and its modern radar and missiles help, but Russia isn't really flying them all that much. Air to air combat has been relatively rare in this war with Ukraine not really having the aircraft to attempt it, and Russia not wanting to lose expensive aircraft to western air defense missiles. \nUkraine is using the F-16 and Mirage 2000-5 the right way, which is in ground attack roles. Neither side has air superiority and this has become a ground war. Ukraine is making decapitation strikes and has been starving the Russian war machine of ammo and oil/fuel. \nIf Ukraine manages to get enough of a stockpile of guided bombs (from whatever country)",

In the early days, he sounded grounded, cautious, and strategically aware — acknowledging the complexity of Russia’s military calculus. But somewhere along the way, perhaps after a few editorial meetings or a polite nudge from the Ministry of Narrative Control, he began to speak in a tone better suited for a pep rally than a geopolitical briefing.\n\nEvery Russian setback became ‘catastrophic,’ every Ukrainian gain ‘decisive,’ and every week was the 'turning point.' His analysis remained ‘based’ — in the technical sense — but strangely always tilted toward the most convenient optimism: Russia running out of missiles, China too afraid to move, NATO forever united, victory around the corner. It’s almost like he started fact-checking reality against Western morale, not the other way around.\n\nThere’s a quiet tragedy in seeing a once-serious voice reduce itself to a dispenser of feel-good predictions, just to keep the war-watchers comfortable. At this point, if Russia were to take Odesa, he’d probably say it's part of Ukraine’s master plan to lure them into overextension. It’s not analysis anymore — it’s theatre",

For most part they were just sending poorly equipped soldiers, wave after wave, without much of an actual plan or strategy... Eventually Germany was defeated allright, but in reality what actually mattered came from the west. Soviet Union managed merely to sacrifice their own people for little gain.\n\nWhile technically it does qualify as a win... In practice it takes a really messed up individual to celebrate such a sad chapter of history. Further compounded by the fact that what followed was Stalin's reign of oppression and terror. If you think the nazis were evil, you better think again, even cautious estimates would put the death toll of Stalin's regime far beyond whatever the nazis did, and this is excluding any actions of war... And Soviet Union didn't stop there.\n\nSo, to celebrate Soviet \"victory\" over the nazis... It is literally an exercise in bad taste, at best. It is practically about as smart as dancing on the graves of the innocent.",

Without the USSR the west would have had zero chance of even successfully landing in Europe. Sure the lend-lease potentially played a critical role in the Eastern front, however, the allies on the West only landed in 1944, and by that time the Soviets were pushing back the Germans at a pretty rapid pace- on their own.\n\n In reality, it is estimated that out the ~27 million soviet casualties, 8~10 million deaths were actual military casualties. The rest were civilians which were rounded up and executed by German soldiers.\n\nIf you look at proper documentation and not random poor estimations, Stalin killed at a maximum of 2~3 million people. You can't compare him to Hitler, whose aim was to EXTERMINATE other races.",

For instance, when Russian infantry comes across a Ukrainian IFV, they would be dead instantly when the airburst hits them. While, when they come across an APC, they might just (perhaps, maaaaaybe) survive a bit longer. Until the infantry dismounts that is, at which point they would be just as dead, though still a whole two minutes later than with the IFV. It's the same with the whole \"rocket\" versus \"missile\" thing. Small difference in wording, major difference in outcome, at least when you're talking about a wartime engagement\n\nDetails matter, so thank you for the correction, I knew of the difference between the two but just hadn't realized they had made a mistake",

This is the new generation of IFVs, the Bradley and Abrams as well as the Leo2 are more than 40 years old. Can create an artillery barrage on its own up to 8.5km\nThis gun also exists in a non intrusive CIWS/C-RAM turret named rapid-fire that surely can be mounted on the top of an APC, like the brother of the EBRC, the VBMR Griffon. Thales is finalizing an active protection system named PROMETEUS to intercept incoming ATGMs, shells or drones before they hit.\nI don't get why some are not being at last tested in Ukraine, even if they're in teething phase, these are really impressive.",

        "text": "The Kremlin, especially now before the parade on Red Square on May 9, ordered the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, to remind about the topic of Nazism in Ukraine. It is the same as the equally absurd topic that the Russian Federation would give up its sovereignty completely to Romania and Poland. That is how it can be compared. The topic of Ukrainian Nazism is simply too marginal and insignificant to analyze at all, which means it is just wasted time. The real and fundamental reason for the Russian Federation to attack Ukraine in a warlike manner is that Ukraine, according to the Kremlin, must be under the thumb of the Moscow authorities, i.e. the Kremlin, and this is the \"FUNDAMENTAL\" reason for this war. And the fact that the Kremlin has once again commissioned Sergei Lavrov to speak, write and remind us of something so marginally, almost imperceptible, is as if the Kremlin had stated that the sun is cold at night because it is night and it is cold at night, or that it is definitely cold on the other side of the sun because we do not see it and we do not know the temperature on the other side of the sun, which is why the sun at night and on the other side of the sun must definitely be cold!!!!!! Because the Kremlin could have stated that it is so, and since \"for example\" something was said on Moscow television about the other part of the sun being definitely cold, it must definitely be so!!!!!! Not every Russian knows that what Moscow television says is true, but some believe it ;) Some Russians already know that this war cannot be won, which means they are dying unnecessarily. The Moscow media never tells the truth!!!!!! The Kremlin has been lying for 107 years, it does not matter what Sergei Lavrov says. It does not matter at all!!! Warmest regards! Hermann Knippenberg.

Putin really nailed the “how to lose your future workforce in one war” strategy. Scare off the brains, send the broke to the front—classic empire-building, right?\nNow we’re on track for the unlikeliest reboot: Russia, by Women—starring zero men under 60 and a population graph that looks like a ski slope. But hey, silver lining: the few surviving dudes can finally live their dream of being state-sponsored baby daddies. Romantic, really. Nothing says “thriving nation” like repopulating via grandpas and ghost towns.",

        "text": "The Kremlin, especially now before the parade on Red Square on May 9, ordered the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, to remind about the topic of Nazism in Ukraine. It is the same as the equally absurd topic that the Russian Federation would give up its sovereignty completely to Romania and Poland. That is how it can be compared. The topic of Ukrainian Nazism is simply too marginal and insignificant to analyze at all, which means it is just wasted time. The real and fundamental reason for the Russian Federation to attack Ukraine in a warlike manner is that Ukraine, according to the Kremlin, must be under the thumb of the Moscow authorities, i.e. the Kremlin, and this is the \"FUNDAMENTAL\" reason for this war. And the fact that the Kremlin has once again commissioned Sergei Lavrov to speak, write and remind us of something so marginally, almost imperceptible, is as if the Kremlin had stated that the sun is cold at night because it is night and it is cold at night, or that it is definitely cold on the other side of the sun because we do not see it and we do not know the temperature on the other side of the sun, which is why the sun at night and on the other side of the sun must definitely be cold!!!!!! Because the Kremlin could have stated that it is so, and since \"for example\" something was said on Moscow television about the other part of the sun being definitely cold, it must definitely be so!!!!!! Not every Russian knows that what Moscow television says is true, but some believe it ;) Some Russians already know that this war cannot be won, which means they are dying unnecessarily. The Moscow media never tells the truth!!!!!! The Kremlin has been lying for 107 years, it does not matter what Sergei Lavrov says. It does not matter at all!!! Warmest regards! H. K.",

Flights were suspended as a safety precaution at four of the capital’s airports, according to Russian aviation authorities.\n\nThe devices launched at Moscow were among 105 Ukrainian drones intercepted across Russia overnight, Russia’s defense ministry said on Telegram Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe latest Ukrainian attack on the Russian capital comes ahead of Xi’s expected arrival in Moscow on Wednesday for a three-day state visit, in which the Chinese leader will take part in Friday’s May 9 Victory Day celebrations, according to a Kremlin statement Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Vietnam’s President To Lam and Belarussian leader Aleksandr Lukashenko are among 29 leaders expected to attend, according to Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov.

Second, Russia has the upper hand since they have pushed most of Zelensky's soldiers out of Russia. Therefore, why does he need to sign? Thirdly, it is more from the point of view of a Vietnamese, Zelensky's situation is a lot similar to the situation of Nguyen Van Thieu, the president of Saigon Regime back in the VIetnamese resistance against the US since Thieu and Zelensky do not have any power to decide their fate. Well, I believe that's the cost of not having a sensible foreign and domestic policy =.=. \nThe question is why are BBC and other Western media outlets trying to conclude that Russia was entirely wrong when discarding the ceasefire. It is true that they did invade Ukraine , but don't you think Zelensky and his malfunctioned government also contributed to their own demise?",

However, I can tell you the moment I realised that Russia would invade Ukraine: it was when Russia had made clear—repeatedly and emphatically—that Ukraine joining NATO was a red line, yet the United States continued to ignore these warnings. This, coupled with the events of 2014, which many view as a Western-backed coup in Kyiv, signalled a turning point.\n\nWhen Alastair Campbell claims that the UK is not at war with Russia, he is either mistaken or being disingenuous. It is now openly acknowledged by American officials that this is, in effect, a proxy war between NATO and Russia, with Ukraine acting as NATO’s proxy. The scale of Western involvement—through the provision of military hardware, intelligence, training, and economic aid—goes far beyond passive support. Western leaders have used increasingly escalatory rhetoric, reinforcing the idea that this is not merely a regional conflict, but a theatre in a broader geopolitical struggle.\n\nMoreover, this scenario was not unforeseeable. The Rand Corporation, a prominent American think tank, produced documents years ago discussing strategies to provoke Russia and overextend its resources—Ukraine was a key part of that analysis. While these documents were presented as theoretical policy planning, they have proven eerily prescient.\n\nThis is not to justify Russia’s invasion, but to contextualise it. Understanding the geopolitical provocations and strategic calculations on all sides is essential if we want to move beyond simplistic narratives and towards a resolution.",

The Bush administration's simplistic and only plan for post-Saddam Iraq was to install Chalabi as a replacement domestic dictator and their stooge/viceroy.  It was already pointed out in 2002, very publicly by Ted Kennedy, that the Bush people had no viable plans to resolve any of Iraq's obvious longstanding internal disputes.  At a minimum Iraq had to be partitioned into three ethnoreligious regions- a reversal of the British kludge- with each of them enabled to form their own representative government, which would or would not chose to form a federation.  The result of not doing this proactively- it happened anyway de facto but took a decade- was basically three different militias/guerrilla armies who fought each other and a US occupation force, a force that correctly hated babysitting what it thought a civil war and trying to prop up an inviable, dysfunctional, imposed set of central government(s).  A silver lining was that the horrible fights for e.g. Fallujah and later ISIS eliminated a lot of the portions of Saddam's former army that had committed all sorts of war crimes over decades mostly on other Iraqis and Kuwaitis and Iranians in prior wars and outright ethnic massacres.",

        "text": "The standard Western position on the Ukraine conflict typically follows this logic:\n•  Sovereign states have the right to choose their own alliances.\n•  NATO is a defensive alliance and poses no threat to others.\n•  The concept of “spheres of influence” (where big countries dominate neighbors) is rejected.\n\nHowever, this narrative often overlooks key historical context:\n↪︎ Warnings from Experts: For over 25 years, leading strategists-including George Kennan, Henry Kissinger, John Mearsheimer, and others-warned that NATO expansion could provoke conflict with Russia.\n↪︎ NATO Expansion: Between 1999 and 2009, NATO admitted 12 new members in three rounds, moving steadily eastward toward Russia’s borders.\n↪︎ U.S. Policy Shifts: In 2002, the U.S. withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, the U.S. installed missile defense systems in Eastern Europe, including Aegis Ashore sites in Romania (2016) and Poland (2024).\n↪︎ Putin’s Warnings: In his 2007 Munich Security Conference speech, President Putin called for a new, fair partnership with the West but strongly criticized NATO’s expansion and U.S. dominance.\n↪︎ Military Presence: NATO increased its military activities and deployments in Eastern Europe, further heightening Russian security concerns.\n↪︎ Ukraine and Georgia: Western efforts to bring these former Soviet republics into NATO were met with strong Russian opposition, which saw them as direct threats.\n↪︎ 2013-2014 Ukraine Crisis: In late 2013, Ukraine’s president suspended an EU Association Agreement under Western pressure, sparking protests (Maidan), which led to his ouster in February 2014. Russia viewed this as a coup; the West called it a revolution.\n↪︎ Crimea and Donbas: Russia annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum in March 2014. Pro-Russian unrest and referendums followed in Donbas, escalating the conflict.\n↪︎ Minsk Agreements: Attempts to resolve the conflict (Minsk I & II, 2015–2022) ultimately failed. Later, Western leaders like Merkel and Hollande admitted that Minsk was used to buy time for Ukraine to strengthen its military.\n↪︎ Western Military Aid: From 2014 to 2021, Western support for Ukraine grew from non-lethal aid to advanced weapons and intelligence, aligning Ukraine more closely with NATO.\n↪︎ Casualties: Around 13,000 combatants and civilians were killed in the Donbas from 2014 to 2021, largely due to Ukrainian shelling.\n↪ Rejected Security Proposals: In December 2021, Russia proposed halting NATO expansion and restructuring European security, but the U.S. and NATO rejected these proposals.\n↪ Recognition and Invasion: Russia recognized the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as independent in February 2022 and launched its “special military operation” (SMO) in Ukraine, citing the UN Charter’s right to self-defense.\n↪︎ Peace Talks Blocked: In March 2022, British PM Boris Johnson reportedly discouraged Ukraine from signing the Istanbul Protocol, which would have included Ukrainian neutrality and security guarantees.\n↪︎ Further Annexations: Russia annexed four more Ukrainian regions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia) in September 2022.\n↪︎ Deep U.S.-Ukraine Partnership: An April 2025 New York Times article revealed a secret, deeply integrated U.S.-Ukraine partnership from early 2022, including intelligence sharing and strategic planning led by U.S. generals-suggesting a more direct U.S.-Russia confrontation than previously acknowledged.\n\nWhile the West frames its actions as supporting sovereignty and defensive alliances, the historical record shows a pattern of expansion and military buildup that many experts warned would provoke Russia. Ignoring this context makes Western arguments appear selective and incomplete.",

Those pylons usually have pusher systems, (a spring would not be enough in general it is gas or explosive system) to push away the ordinance, so just before the missile is ignited, the pusher system launches is vertically and probably strong enough to give is proper clearance for it to be able to fly away without first crashing into the sea. Those pushers are important on a fighter jet because it is those which avoid the bomb or missile tu be sucked in toward the jet itself by aerodynamic forces (with potential catastrophic outcome). This probably required a lot of work and experimentation in order to fine tune for reliable weapon firing in a completely different way. Very clever.",

The vaunted Russian offensive... where is it? The Russians are now taking a beating around both Pokrovsk and Toretsk, yet they continue suicide attacks AND are losing ground. Losing ≈ 1200 per day while going backward is no joke.  Was the intent that the forces that threw the Ukrainians back in Kursk would become a serious offensive? It's not happening. So.... ???\n\n2. Putin's mobilization ... really? To be useful to Putin these conscripts must be induced or coerced into signing the contracts for combat in Ukraine... and then what does he have?  Nothing more than fresh meat.  Russia doesn't have the tanks, APCs, or much of the other supplies.  And these raw recruits can't be trained to be anything more than meat in time for this fighting season.    Looks to me like Putin's army is desperately close to collapse.  What is the counter-argument against that?\n\n3. Ukraine's long-range drones are getting numerous and there is steady progress on enhanced capability.  How much of a beating can Russia take?",

The Dutch AF had to patch up spots on several airframes because the extra equipment and heavy use caused bits to wear out faster. \nNone of that is a problem when extra parts are available. Which is what the AMARG bodies are for. \n\nRemember that the European training programmes for UkAF F-16s are not just for pilots: Plane captains, maintenance crews, logistics people and staffers are also trained.",

        "text": "Thanks again for another great update, Denys.  In America, most people feel it is strange for Trump to be proclaiming new \"Victory Days\" for the end of WWI and WWII.  Since 1868, the USA has celebrated Memorial Day on 30 May and now the fourth Monday in May.  This federal holiday originally was held to honor the Union soldiers who died in the American Civil War; now it honors all military personnel that have died serving in any of America's wars.  Since the end of WWI in 1918 and the signing of the treaty in 1919, the USA has celebrated Veterans Day on 11 November, the date of Versailles Armistice  This federal holiday honors all currently serving and past members of the military in both peace and war time.  So the USA has been commemorating the end of WWI for 105 years... why do we need to change the name to Victory Day to appease Trump's ego?  And why do we need a second holiday in May celebrating the end of the European War in 1945?  Does this mean we should have an end of the Pacific war Victory Day on 2 September when Japan surrendered in 1945?  And Trump doesn't know history, he claims the USA \"did more\" to win these world wars than any other country.  How do we measure \"did more\"?  In Allied military and civilian deaths, Belarus lost 25% of their prewar population, Poland 17%, Ukraine, 16.5 %, the rest of the USSR 15%, France 2%, UK 1% and the USA 0.5%.  So instead of celebrating a victory, we should be focusing on the sacrifices made by all of our military personnel on our traditional Memorial Day and Veterans Day.",

If billions in American capital go to industry in Ukraine, the USA has a strong incentive to protect that investment.  If the support happens, (almost) all else pales to insignificance.\n\nI am sure that President Zelenskyy does not need me to advice caution in any deal with the White House.\n\nI am an American, and I absolutely loathe the idea of holding a military parade in America.  That is beneath despicable.  We have already received the disgust and derision of every civilized country in the world, but a Soviet-style military parade would be an irrecoverable humiliation.",

Both sides have started building net tunnels on the roads.   \nI don't think its that easy to sever the fibre optic but they are using drones to target the fibre optic drones. \n\nOne thing is they fo drones are slower and limited in weight. \n\nThe thing is wire guided missiles have been around since the 60s and were used in the 73 Yom Kippur war.  \n\nMy understanding is that the Ukrainians were forced out of the Kursk salient because the Russians primarily targeted the supply trucks of the Ukrainian forces which forced them out.",

Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 so that is NOT a gain of the war which began in 2022. \nSecondly, most of the Donbass region has been under Russian control since 2014, again NOT as a result of the war which began in 2022.\nThirdly, Russia expected victory very quickly when they invaded Ukraine in 2022. Evidence: The paratroopers who attempted to capture Kyiv and failed miserably had their victory uniforms in their backpacks. You do NOT carry such a uniform unless you expect little to no resistance and fully expect an easy and quick victory.\nFourthly, the fact Russia has used mercenaries, prisoners, North Korean soldiers, and equipment from many allies shows just how depleted their own forces/equipment is.\nLast but not least, the fact is that they have in 3+ years failed to capture much territory they did not already have troops occupying various areas before 2022 says the mission has been an abject failure.\nYOU can attempt to dress it up as much as you like but since 2022 Russia has accomplished very little in Ukraine and most military observers would say Russia is indeed losing this war badly.",

It's hard to say no when you’ve got nothing and someone waves that kind of money in your face.\n\nAdd to that ignorance; many of them have no idea what’s really going on at the front. When they signed up, they genuinely believed they wouldn’t be sent into battle. One Ukrainian journalist has been documenting interviews with Russian POWs, and every single one of them says the same thing: they joined for the money. Plain and simple. They were broke.

Если потери РФ составляет миллион , то кто воюет за Россию ??????😂😂😂😂😂 Я просто хочу вас заставить всех задуматься, что кто то вас обманывает и дезинформирует ....

So how does this mineral deal over Ukraines resources supposed to be shared out??\nZelensky signed a 100 yesr deal with UK, presumably psrt of which gives UK ownership of certain resources, and a 10year deal with Washington, so who will own what, and in which areas of the Ukraine??\nOr will there be vonstant war with Russia over who owns what as the Russians given blood and treasure in taking areas of Ukraine will ( rightly) drclare ownership of soil captured, and as consequence whatever ( elusive) rare- earth minerals held therein!!\nThe problem that Trump has fallen into is that of greed!! Graham has convinced him of some $13 trillion of resources, which he said should not be shared, with any of these ' minerals' going to China!!\nThst was the key to ' turning' Trump, for his determination to bring China to heel, is alas very the same as Biden's efforts to bring down Putin!!\nThe stupidity of all this, is that neither, Trump, Zelensky, Macron, Starmer, Ursula, even Putin eill be around in 10 years to see any of this come to fruition, or gain!!\nThis is the fallacy of keeping this debacle going, Putin will take Ukraine, or rsther Russia will, piece by piece until all theor goals in Ukraine are met, Trump and his sychophants, both in his Administration, and in Europe, can/ will huff and puff, but until the reality is understood by Europe and the US, one can only see further death and destruction of Ukraine, and Trump will only sink further into the mire of failure, and the sinking of his Presidency, which it can be said boldly, died in his first 100 days in office!!

Unlike previous administrations who could be accused of being natural 'anti-Russia', this one has given Putin a chance at diplomacy.  It may appear like the US has been banging it's head against a brick wall, but 50 years from now after WW3, post analysis, it can never be denied that the option to avoid escalation was there.  The President has been overly fair to Russia, without prejudice, and it is often overlooked how significant this will be when we revisit from hindsight.  Russia failed the test.  They had the opportunity to gain Crimea.  I suspect their greed will now result in them losing all territory.",

He just handed her ' One Hundred pounds in cash out of the blue. She was shocked 😲 and said Whats this for??? The Russian guy said ; because he was very sorry about the War that is happening Upon the Ukraine 🇺🇦 and then he said nothing else.   This highlights the truth that there should be Peace and Respect between all countries and cultures.  But Putins paranoia and his agression they are just so misguided and Wrong. All cultures should live in Peace. He is wrong . Because you see this Russian was just an ordinary guy, who didnt want this War. Same as the rest of us.",

The cost in lives and popularity will never go away. They lost more than they will ever be able to recover from. Its not who wins, itw how bad will Russia lose when the white flag flies?",

Also, most reports have artillery and drones as the largest current causes of casualties. It has been the effectiveness of drone spotters for artillery that means large concentrations of troops are no longer possible as they get destroyed by artillery. The solution to this is smaller dispersed units, but this is where FPV drones then dominate the cause of casualties.",

What we currently have in Ukraine is similar to the situation that existed for most of WWI on the west front: a stalemate with small gains won or lost by either side from day-to-day. Ukraine simply does not have enough equipment, forces or resources to take back the land they lost in 2022. On the flip side Russia no longer possesses the conventional forces needed to win the war on their terms as long as NATO nations continue to provide equipment and supplies to Ukraine. As for the lost land, Ukraine must accept the ground reality that the land they have lost to Russia is gone forever, especially the Crimea. The only way that could ever change would be if NATO directly intervenes in the war and fights Russia. If that were to happen, we would quickly move to WWIII and most likely a large nuclear exchange, so realistically I don't see such NATO intervention happening, as the stakes are just too high. The question at this point is how much more destruction and death must occur before both sides finally accept the truth that the current situation on the ground is as good as it going to get, and both sides finally end the war?  While personally I don't like to see Russia end the war with Ukrainian land as their ill-gotten gains, the war with it's ever increasing death and destruction must end before it at some point spirals further out of control and we end up in WWIII.",

Finally, the Russian economy is in shambles and it has only gotten worse with the collapsing oil price so far into 2025.

Heureusement, moins largement partagée, et on a un gouvernement qui a les c**illes de prendre position. De mon point de vue, c'est la seule chose positive des deux mandats de Macron. Mais je n'oublie pas qu'il était très impressionné par Trump, il n'y a pas si longtemps.\nTrop de gens pensent encore \"c'est loin de chez nous\", \"ils s'arrêteront là\". On a vu comment le Troisième Reich a profité de cette mentalité. Et Putin est complètement dans un état d'esprit similaire. Moins il y aura de réaction, plus son expansion militaire s'amplifiera. Déjà qu'il a peu de considération pour la pression internationale.\nFaire plus ? Je ne pense pas qu'on puisse faire beaucoup plus sans que ça dégénère en guerre totale. On ne peut pas envoyer de troupes, mais on pourrait étendre les formations militaires. On a encore plein de casernes, heureusement.\nOn pourrait surtout faciliter et accueillir plus de réfugiés",
