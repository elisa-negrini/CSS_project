The bill, passed by the parliament on July 16, is primarily seen as targeting Russia's ""shadow fleet"" of aging and poorly insured tankers, which Moscow uses to evade sanctions and conduct espionage, among other objectives.

The law also amends sanctions legislation to enable restrictions against vessels and aircraft deemed to pose risks to Ukraine's national security, territorial integrity, and sovereignty.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and intelligence agencies are empowered to identify and track such vessels.

Russia's shadow fleet has been increasingly targeted by Western sanctions as Kyiv's international partners seek to curb Russian oil revenues, which help fund its war machine.

More than 100 shadow fleet ships were targeted in the EU's 18th sanctions package approved earlier this month. Only a few days later, the U.K. sanctioned 135 Russian oil tankers and two shipping companies linked to Russia's shadow fleet.

Both the EU and the U.K. also agreed to lower the price cap imposed on Russian crude oil from $60 per barrel to $47.60.",2025-07-30T12:26:43

Is Yermak corrupt? Probably yes. There were rumors, even a hidden camera video with his brother talking about the price for appointing officials (not accusing, but proposing).

Is he the *most corrupt*? I don't know. It needs a way to measure the corruption of different officials.

Is he the source of corruption in Ukraine? Rather a minor one, but still one of those.

Will the situation get better if Yermak is removed? I think so. Will it get better for Zelenskyy? I think he doesn't think so.

Why is Zelenskyy so dependent on him? Zelenskyy wasn't a politician and required someone to advise him. Yermak was his old friend (entertainment producer) involved in some politics, so he captured the place.

The worst part is probably that Yermak doesn't consider democracy to be a value but only thinks about misusing democratic procedures for his benefit. The good part here is that Yermak is only a president's aide, not an independent politician (and never will be one), so he will be gone with Zelenskyy out of his office.

With the possibilities open to Yermak, he could be one of the richest people in Ukraine by now (or make some of his associates such); we already had people like Kurchenko in the past.

According to investigation by Bellingcat and The Insider, the operation was carried out with the covert participation of the United States and Turkish Airlines. **The special operation failed in July 2020 due to the postponement of its critical phase on the orders by Andriy Yermak** and the alleged leakage of information from the Office of the President of Ukraine.

In 11 years, NABU has prosecuted, in total, 71 cases of corruption. Currently they have 31 cases open. Per some of the reporting this is not even the cases prosecuted, this is the total extent of their action with just cases they looked INTO.

If 31 open cases, or 71 prosecuted in 11(!) years is a lot, then maybe Ukraine doesn't need any anti-corruption office, as it seems to be such idyllic place. Comparing to UK, which in ONE year had 63 cases brought to prosecution for misconduct and bribery, which is a sharp (34%) decline from previous years.

The measure enables older volunteers to serve in non-combat and specialized roles, expanding Ukraine's recruitment pool amid continued manpower shortages.

Under the new law, people over 60 may sign a one-year contract for military service if they pass a medical commission and are approved by a unit commander. Officer candidates must also be cleared by the General Staff or relevant military authorities.

Each new recruit will undergo a two-month probationary period. If deemed unfit during that time, the contract may be terminated early. The law does not establish a maximum age limit for service, but all contracts will be voided automatically once martial law ends.

Ukraine faced serious manpower shortages in late 2024 amid a heavy Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The Ukrainian leadership has sought to alleviate the crisis by broadening the mobilization pool and offering new incentives for volunteers.

In April 2024, Kyiv lowered the draft age from 27 to 25. In February 2025, the country introduced one-year contracts for 18-24-year-old volunteers with added financial incentives.

The new law is expected to help address staffing gaps in technical, logistical, and support units, where experienced professionals are in high demand.",2025-07-29T13:04:24

Russian defense industries are backward in many regards sadly when it comes to drones they managed to scale up tremendously and exponentially with Iranian and Chinese help and due to Western companies and front companies in Central Asia that make these sanction evasion schemes are only possible as long as the West does not bear down on them with harsh prison sentences for the traitorous companies that work against our common interests by supplying these terrorist in Russia with spare parts and microchips.

Plus, let us not forget industrial scale and exponential growth. Ukraine might very soon be able to produce these interceptors in much larger quantities just as they managed to scale up drone production estimates for 2025, which range from 3 million to 4.5 million for 2025. Next year they will likely go beyond 5 million if we take industrial scaling into account.

One of the interceptor drones costs 1000 euros, and each shahed costs around 30.000 euros. If not more, it is hard to tell how much Russia pays for them. But this is the kind of ratio Ukraine would want to make it worth it from a monetary economic perspective.",2025-07-29T13:00:49

Ukraine is testing them, too. The Economist: Each shot costs &lt;$10 vs. $100K+ per missile. In 2024, a 20 kW US LOCUST laser downed Iran drones at a Mideast base. Ukraine’s Tryzub laser destroyed Russian FPV drones in April 2025.

https://x .com/ Mylovanov/  status/1949160564363502054

These interceptors are just one of many different technologies currently being scaled up that will soon provide a much better defense capacity of Ukraine against these drones plus war can change quickly I still hope that Ukraine will also manage to scale up sabotage and direct kinetic and cyber attacks against Russian production sites.

Plus, Russia is even more helpless against the strikes of Ukrainian drones as their land area is massive, and Ukraine and her allies are, of course, nowhere near the maximum of industrial scale in terms of their potential capacity. 

Much more money and resources should be invested into the Ukrainian drone production sector, and Ukraine should be finally given a free hand to target these Russian drone production facilities with our missiles.

In total, to bring Russia to heel, a much more aggressive and less timid approach should be pursued as moderation in war is imbecility. It is violence in its essence. It should, of course, also be allowed and carried out to go after the worker quarters of these factories. Those workers have been a valid military target for the allies in WW2 and by working for the terrorist Russian military complex they make themselves a target and in these remote factories the mere destruction of the worker quarters even without the workers inside could proof quite effective.

And Russian attacks are higher than before yes, but there is fluctuation and what is happening today is no guarantee for how the situation looks like in three months or 6 months war is highly complex and things can change quickly for good or worse so making any estimates on how the drone war will evolve and if Russia has the upper hand is not easy to assess unless we do it ex post to connect the dots.

I see Russia fire a lot of their drones and missiles at non military targets, which is usually not a good strategy to win the war. And Russia keeps on creeping forward so maybe they should rather their focus on the military targets unless the only goal is to terrorise the population which will only result in more resistance by the Ukrainians and more support by her allies.",2025-07-29T13:19:36

The western allies have unmatched economic and industrial capacity compared to russia. Yet russia outmatches them all when it comes to military industry - even after loud and bragging words. 


Russia has about 10:1 advantage in nearly every piece of equipment except FPV drones. And yes, it's despite the Czech initiative that brought about 1.5 millions artillery shells - russia had received about 7 millions shells from NK (most of which are probably Chinese shells marked as NK), in addition to their domestic production which is still larger than the Czech initiative. 


The whole artillery war did not ended in the landslide only because Ukrainian drone teams targeted the artillery pieces as their priority target. But being often the ancient relic of ww2, many artillery pieces had survived the strikes - because otherwise 1000+ artillery losses would finish entire russian artillery park many months ago. 


The biggest problems for a very long time (since at least late 2022 - almost three years so far!) is the massive short and medium-range anti-air that can target russian shaheds, cruise missiles and frontline bombers that use umpk bombs (that are usually misnamed as KABs). Umpk threat was the biggest problem on the Frontline for years, because they can destroy even well fortified positions - and russians launch them about 100 bombs a day. 


The west has the abilities to counter these threats - from the delivery of required anti- air systems to the mission to protect Ukrainian sky as a plan of joint forces and direct involvement in the war. Russia cannot answer to these threats - it is very obvious they can't launch a war against any other country now, save for the entire biggest military power block. Yet Ukraine received none of that. Even russian recon drones that used to block the sun in eastern, southern and northern Ukraine - the eyes of russian military - they could fly undisputed until the recent development of Ukrainian anti-air drone interceptors that started to reap them by hundreds. 


The indecisive stance of western allies, their preference of loud and empty words instead of actions louder than words, their populist rhetoric and their inability to put pieces together costed Ukraine so many lives, emboldened russia to continue the war no matter what, and recently emboldened China to commit to the russian side. We can be sure that recent uptick of russian long-range strike drones capabilities is solely the result of Chinese military-industrial complex backing them up. Without Chinese investments, russia had not the industrial capacity to scale them so rapidly. And recent answer of China to the threat of American sanctions shows that they are committed to their cause and honestly that they call Trump's bluff and don't believe he won't chicken out (and they have too many reasons to think that).


And yes, I am grateful for every amount of assistance Ukraine had received so far. But let's be real: the whole western military support, while unprecedented, still hovers at just above hundred billions dollars, while russian and their allies' commitment is already in trillions. Unfortunately, at this stage of war the industrial capacity and spending are the most decisive factors, and let's be honest, western support is on the backfoot since 2023, while russians and their allies increase their commitment all the time. ",2025-07-30T04:01:11
1mc4nlm,"Zelensky sets 1,000-daily interceptor drones goal amid surging Russian attacks",Loki9101,780,2025-07-29T07:01:54,Loki9101,1,"The biggest problem is not of a military but of a political and economic nature. The Western allies maybe with the exception of Poland and the Baltics and maybe Finland have no direct interest in seeing Ukraine win at least not in a decisive and quick manner. The political approach and the policy is to support Ukraine so that she does not lose and to bleed Russia dry in the process sadly at the cost of turning Ukraine into a nightmarish battlefield where for example in the Donbas the economy is finished for a long time now and other areas only survive due to Western money injections and by turning the Ukrainian economy into a war economy.

However, in terms of tanks, for example, Russia maybe had a 1:10 advantage but surely not anymore given their losses and their moderate new production rates and depleting stockpiles as Covert Cabal and Himarsed have shown. But also Perun and others cited thet Russia can produce no more then 180 to 200 T90 M a year which is about as much as they lose within 1.5 months, the rest must come from dwindling and ever less sophisticated stockpiles of T 64 or T55 tanks.

I think in terms of BT3s they manage now to produce around 600 of them per year, which is better but still by far not enough to make up for their losses which are roughly three times as high. 

It is therefore also a quality and quantity discussion that we must have.

In terms of artillery the Russian army follows the Soviet doctrine mass over class and Ukraine is being trained by the West for over a decade now in point fire artillery such as Cesar systems or PZH2000 or Krab or their own systems of which they can by now produce about 12 to 14 a month and the scale will go up.

In the air and in terms of missiles, they still have a massive advantage due to the West being simply unwilling to change that there would have been enough time to massively expand production which has not happened.

And yet the times in which Russia has a 10:1 advantage in most categories are over. And in terms of artillery fire it doesn't depend on how much you fire but rather on whether you achieve your targets with your firepower. 


When I look at the map and when I look at the same map 3 years ago, then Russia has been highly ineffective in making use of their once massive advantages and they still prove highly ineffective with their now much smaller advantage compared to let us say the period from February 2022 to at least early to mid 2024 when their advantages in terms of fire power and heavy armor were still much more pronounced than they are today.",2025-07-31T14:19:56

So far in July, Russia has launched a total of 4,929 drones and 148 missiles into Ukraine, according to Ukraine's air force -- at an average of around 234 drones and seven missiles each day.

June saw 5,438 drones and 239 missiles fired into Ukraine, with a daily average of 181 drones and nearly eight missiles.

And in May, Russia launched a total of 3,835 drones and 117 missiles, for an average of around 124 drones and nearly four missiles each day.

Though smaller in scale, Ukraine also appears to be increasing the intensity of its drone attacks into Russia. So far this month, the Defense Ministry in Moscow has reported downing 2,303 Ukrainian drones at an average of 109 per day.

In June, the ministry reported downing a total of 2,368 Ukrainian drones, with an average of almost 79 drones per day across the month. Those figures were down from May, during which the ministry said it shot down 3,611 drones with an average of 116 per day.


Plus, it is, of course, not a thousand drones per day but a lot less from Russia, as you can see above. The goal of Ukraine is to increase their interceptor production output to 1000 pieces every day as I suppose you need a lot of them to cover such a large country as Ukraine to make a meaningful impact.

Ukraine already uses listening  posts to locate artillery fire by triangulation.  If those microphones are extended in a grid or network as soon as an incoming drone is heard by two or three it's course and speed can be determined and a counter drone sent up to meet it. If the network is dense and extensive enough mid flight tracking and course changes can detected in real time to insure the counter drone finds it's target. It would not surprise me to hear that such a system is already being built or in service.,2025-07-29T23:30:15

1m9mmbq,"Zelensky's big Ukraine blunder, explained",yorkiecd,69,2025-07-26T06:46:33,Le1bn1z,1,"Let's go through it one piece at a time.

First, what happens if the people immediately around him go down? Answer: Ukraine has a large and well staffed administrative state, with layers of educated and trained deputies and experts outside the current government leadership. If they go down, someone else steps in. This is common, and is why Zelensky has been able to shuffle key leadership positions in his own office and in the military.

Second, is it possible to have a president of Ukraine who does not have corrupt people around them the let slide? Answer: Yes, eventually, as long as society remains mobilised and defends its independent press and power. Currently? It would be difficult, but possible. It would just mean a major internal fight.

Wherever it is pervasive, corruption is structural and endemic. Generally, corruption and other extractive economic and political institutions are self reinforcing. Gateways to advancement are guarded by the corrupt, with striking corrupt deals being the price for advancement. Ironically, playing the corruption game becomes critical for forming coalitions capable of challenging that corruption. To root out the corrupt, you have to go to war with the institutions of corruption that infect the state and business, which tend to invest heavily in defending themselves.

Likewise, the corrupt tend to be powerful - which they have to be in order to succeed in their corruption. So fighting corruption means fighting powerful organizations who can and will do real damage if confronted.

It's particularly tough for Zelensky. Early in the war, Ukraine suffered some serious losses due to Russian infiltration - perhaps most infamously in Kherson, where Russia bought out local administrators to sabotage key defensive measures, allowing Russia to rapidly advance. But this is hardly isolated.

It would be understandable for Zelensky to put a premium on loyalty for his inner circle, given the critical importance of infosec and very real fears of assassination or coup. This is a *huge* problem for fighting corruption, however, as hyper-loyal lieutenants tend to be more focused on protecting and consolidating power than anything else, and that is incompatible with fighting corruption which requires strong institutions that either apply independent or popular pressure to uncover and defeat corrupt groups in government.

There has to be real fear, however, that Zelensky knew of and condoned some corruption in his government in the name of not having to confront powerful corrupt interests and instead bring them onside in the face of an existential threat. This has been a constant in history. Pitt the Younger and Henry Dundas would empathize. But that still poses a real political and strategic threat to Zelensky.",2025-07-30T19:49:21

Im sure the stronger ties with EU will change this a lot but could take some time for the field to change their ways and integrate with the Europe.

&gt;Explain why it's done. (Heavy RuZ infiltration and corruption of NABU)

This was really only a scapegoat nonsense that has came up from the government and the administration. Aside from one or two cases, this is completely unsubstantiated.

&gt;Protest erupted (as expected, not hard to predict). Non-violence and Non-suppression are important, which Zelensky supported.

He has to do that unless he literally wants his regime to fall. Loose the general public and you loose the soldiers on the frontline (whoa re fighting for the people, not the regime).

&gt;Using the widespread protest as justification, consult with Western partners to revise the bill. Restoring NABU independence, but with the condition of stronger oversight for all intel agencies.

&gt;Those who supported the original bill are now under public scrutiny, so they will be on their toes. If they don't wanna get investigated.

&gt;The corrupt/traitorous elements in all intel agencies are also on their toes, no more immunity.

This is also nonsense, just back-justification of the mess the government created. They have to revise the bill cause if they don't, they'll loose support of their single most important ally (one on who's support now hinge even the US weapons), the EU. The whole administration and the whole Rada were for this, so now the whole government is under scrutiny per your post? Also, there was NO IMMUNITY for the NABU or SOBA, their employees could have been (and have been in the past) prosecuted for espionage and treason. Without shafting both agencies completely.

&gt;Result: A stronger, democratic, less corrupt Ukraine. Basically, a partial detox/reset of the government and intel agencies. Gains more trust from the people and Western allies.

No cause it makes him look like a bumbling fool who tried to do a bad thing, got caught, spanked by the allies and by the people and had to back down. The optics Ukraine lost on this issue are not magically going back and the RU-supported propaganda machine is going to take full advantage of this.

It also created several really really bad situations - The taboo on war time protests was broken and if the Russians took the advantage of this, there could have been just a crapton of people killed. Russian propaganda has spun a ton of negative ""look ho corrupt Ukraine is"" stories that are very detrimental to the already worsening imagine of Ukraine throughout the EU.

Veneration to the point of seeing our leaders through rose tainted glasses is a tempting but dark path. The Ukrainian people evidently get this. It's a human instinct to justify actions of leaders; the leaders (kings, chiefs) have selected us for it throughout ages by killed dissidents. People must keep this instinct in check to ensure that they are the real leader. Loyalty towards leaders/parties/ideologies/""our side"" is an anti-pattern in democracy, it dulls the leaders loyalty to the people, because they can take their power for granted.   
  
Many democracies are deeply flawed in this way for various reasons, often to the point not being true democracies because of it. We can all think of some obvious examples. The strongest democracies also are constantly being held back by loyalty from the people towards leadership. Concretely, for full democracies it takes the form of big old parties getting uncritical votes that they don't deserve based on their latest agendas or performances, for reasons such as apathy, habit, personal social dynamics, rigid ideology, or straight up principally misguided unwavering loyalty. It's on the people to continuously nurture a democratic culture that remedies it, and the longer it's been since it has experienced authoritarian rule, the harder it is to remember, and the easier it comes back. For flawed democracies, it takes the form of propaganda that fosters loyalty in the wrong direction. Not the only reason for flawed democracy, but alone a sufficient reason to call it flawed.   
  
That's why I'm extremely encouraged by these latest event, flipped from my initial discouragement. I knew Ukraine was was an institutional democracy, but I didn't know there was such a strong democratic culture to enforce it.",2025-07-25T10:34:01

I think this was very reactionary because once Russian Spies were found, Zelensky and Parliament acted with a full ""Scorched Earth"" Policy.

They are at war: Spies, in any agency, don't just get arrested, the whole branch needs a full clean-out.

That was the goal.

Was re-establishing NABU part of the original goal?  More than likely it was, because Ukraine wants to be in the EU.

Was it part of the goal this quickly?  I don't think so. 

I don't think the public outcry was expected, especially during wartime. 

It's clear Zelensky held no opposition to re-establishing the NABU oversight but I think this was something he originally intended to do once the war was over.  I mean... if Ukraine loses and Russia takes it, obviously NABU is getting dismantled anyway, if Ukraine wins the war, obviously the NABU needs to be put back for EU consideration.

Unfortunately they've demonstrated repeatedly that they are still able to take ground through small unit infantry assaults rather than armored spearheads. In fact, practically the only way they've taken ground in the past year or two has been through small unit infantry attacks. The downside of this strategy is that it results in very high casualties. But Russia has a strong ability to shrug off casualties. 

Their bottleneck at this point is very likely to be financial, at some point they won't be able to keep paying these very high signing bonuses and then they'll start running out of men, but when that will actually happen is unclear. Some people are saying late 2025 or early 2026, but those are just guesses. 

Drone warfare has also definitely changed the game here, armored vehicles still have a big role to play on the modern battlefield but only if they're covered by anti drone units, and right now neither side has shown an ability to consistently provide cover to armored units. There's a reason why Ukraine is always asking for AD assets and drones rather than more tanks.",2025-07-25T14:31:35

No one is disagreeing that corruption should be challenged constantly. We are saying the timing and blasting across all social media of specific viewpoints of this topic is worth raising an eyebrow about.

There is a time and a place for making a stance against something wrong. You do not stand up to an injustice, alone, just to get killed with no witnesses. Nothing is accomplished by that sacrifice. You're just another potential for good swept away into the darkness. 

Trust is something that is always blindly given. You can never know what the person you are trusting intends to do. So many people trusted Zelensky for years, but now that he makes one decision people do not understand, they turn on him and the rest of the government? That was never trust to begin with. That was mutual benefit that ended the second there was a disagreement. 

This is a complex issue that requires time and discussion to get a full understanding of. It requires more than childish binary logic.

With the start of full-scale war, the country rallied around him and people supported him in everything. There was even an unspoken agreement to forgive minor mistakes and not criticize the government, because it would harm the whole country. 

But people still saw what was happening, and the audacity with which this law was pushed through in 24 hours was comparable to Yanukovych's attempt to renounce association with the EU (which sparked the second Maidan). This is what sparked the protest; it was a refusal to join the European Union, and that is a red line.",2025-07-24T16:20:45

I do not personally think he is himself corrupt but some of the people around him are shady. I dont think you can become wealthy and successful in ukraine withour having corruption around you. He shows loyalty to even those accused of it and i dont know why but i suppose it is really risky especially now during the war to not have people totally loyal for protection even if they are shifty.

The entire party he got into the Rada is mostly made up of his personal friends and business partners, who weren't necessarily the best for the position, which just screams nepotism. Some of these people include anti-Maidan fuckers who used to back Yanukovych.

He did a phenomenal job at the start of the war by staying and galvanizing hope and resistance, and his relentless pursuit for international aid and keeping Ukraine in the media cycle is impressive. But nobody is perfect, and for decades corruption has been cultural and institutionalized in Ukraine. You don't get rid of that in a few short years.

There is also the other side, though: these anti-corruption agencies have been busted multiple times for having people in there who worked with the Russians to undermine Ukraine. So when Zelenskyy says that the whole institution is corroded by Russian-sympathizers or outright agents, he's not wrong... but he knew that for years. Until now the approach was individual: arrest the bad eggs, leave the institutions alone. It's certainly an interesting ""coincidence"" that he and his party rapidly pushed through this law NOW, right after it was announced that multiple high profile corruption cases were about to be prosecuted by these agencies against his personal inner circle.",2025-07-24T06:29:26

- Never took a public stand during key national events like Euromaidan or early phase of war. Not a single pro-Ukrainian statement from him. Quite the opposite if you listen to his previous comedy content carefully.

- Rose to power via oligarch-linked media (1+1). Appointed allies of Kolomoysky. Delayed action on PrivatBank case.

- Continued sweetly earning from Russian audiences after 2014 invasion - had production companies there.

- Promised to end the war by ""just talking to Putin"" and ""stopping to shoot"". Ran on bizarre populist slogans, not actual plans.


- Replaced actual reformers with loyalists. Judicial reform stalled. Filled top government posts with comedy friends and TV producers with zero previous expertise or competence.

- The infamous ""barbecue speech"" to the public in Jan 2022 when asked about the probability of a full-scale invasion. 

- Wasn't able to answer a single question on government matters coherently in the 2019 - 2021 period. What you see now is a very different image to what Ukrainians saw before. And it is a carefully engineered one.

- Downplayed threat from Russia in late 2021, despite as we know now being aware of intelligence to the contrary. Disbanded or neglected some defence initiatives, leaving areas vulnerable.


His approval ratings were very low just before the war. Make no mistake, with the war Ukrainians rallied behind the flag, not behind the president. As long as he continues to fulfil the mandate he's been now given by the current social contract (which is mostly limited to international representation where he's doing very well), people will continue to tolerate him.

It was an organized and timed attack from the inside:

1. NABU, SAP and the Anticorruption court faced many, many systemic challenges in bringing large corruption offenders to justice. It's not easy, but they were finally becoming more efficient, and announced investigations into a couple high-placed people close to Ze.

2. SBU and Prosecutors come to NABU with searches, under the guise of investigation into one guy with alleged russian links (no proof shown yet) and a couple guys with traffic accidents in like 2021 and 2023.

3. Parliament is about to have a final vote on a law deregulating some bureacracy regarding looking for missing persons. A most odious MP from SotP adds amendments to this law that take away independence from NABU and SAP and subordinate them to General Prosecutor (a political appointee loyal to President).

4. Parliament votes the law in. Protests online start immediately, people gather in the streets in a couple hours demanding Zelensky not sign it, but he signs it almost immediately. Parliament goes on a summer break for 4 weeks

5. Now he's saying ""I hear the people's concerns, I asked the law enforcement orgs to come up with a draft law to change the system, make it better, more independent, blah blah blah""

6. And this is just my speculation: The independence of these bodies will (hopefully) be restored, because of pressure from the people and the EU, but it could take a month or two or more, meanwhile those investigations into the close circle will be dismantled, evidence will get lost in transfer, etc. Voila.

1m7d7kt,Ukrainian lawmaker's warning amid Zelensky’s anti-corruption crackdown,KI_official,49,2025-07-23T16:02:14,Balancing-Unbalance,1,"""Now, I know I'm not very comfortable for my own fraction. Let me just say I have zero intention of becoming comfortable.""

As long as politicians like Anastasia Radina can speak out like that against their own, as long as peaceful protests can be held, Ukraine is on the right track it seems to me.

I may even go one step further and contend Ukraine is perhaps a step ahead of the curve as compared to many western ""democracies"" atm, where protests may or may not be allowed to continue - depending on the topic - but politicians certainly can't be bothered in the slightest by them. And politicians speaking out against the partyline is becoming far too rare over here for my liking as well ...",2025-07-24T11:35:10

if Ukraine is not part of EU it will become part of Russia. Like it or not, the goal of Russia is to have full control over Ukraine. Europe doesn't destroy sovereignty, but it understands that corruption is what destroys a democracies.

Maybe NABU is corrupted as you said, but this step isn't in direction of fighting corruption, but consolidation power (i.e. the opposite), unless Zalensky will deliver on his promise, this doesn't look good.

If Ukraine won't destroy corruption it will naturally drift toward Russia (kind of like you see with Belarus).

Only one of them (15 votes) is independent of president and his office.

All others we can split in 2 groups: 1. Servant of People (Zelenskyy’s party, fully controlled by him, absolute majority of members always vote as he/his office dictates). 2. Few fragments of the former Party of Regions (Yanukovich, I guess you know the name). These are always voting together with Zelenskyy’s party for all important decisions. Why so? They were in a very vulnerable position when full scale invasion started in 2022 (because they were perceived as a pro-ruzzian force, rightfully so). Zelenskyy’s office used that… no, not to find a way to remove that scum from parliament. To guarantee their safety in exchange for a guarantee of their votes (because otherwise Servant of People would have had to bargain with their political opponents for big decisions, they lost quite a few members until then and wouldn’t have had a majority on their own).

Even if every single member of the anti corruption board is a russian spy you shouldn't take the Independece from such an important organ.But instead replace it's members.If you take away their Independence you make them unable to prosecute high officials making their entire reason to exist questionable.

In my personal opinion the Connections to russia are an excuse and this is a power grab to keep the News on curruption of Military Investmentments Secret.It is a bad look if Money from other countries by for example Germany partialy goes into the pockets of a corrupt politican instead to the war effort and this could make news,be used by Russia for Propaganda ,and worst case stop further Investment by other countries.I think it is an open Secret the Corruption existed before the war and exists now.and i think selensky wants to Fight Corrupt politicans in secret without causing ""Problems"" for the war effort.

However all this Reasons he might have aren't a valid Reason.And Ukraine really really need and Independent anti Corruption board with Trustworthy people.and ukraine people are rightfully enraged and see the dangers in this step Back.

The recent law was intended to bring Ukraine's anti-corruption machinery under more direct control from the central government — not to abolish the agencies entirely.  That is just made-up nonsense.  They used to be highly independent and autonomous, in order to do their anti-corruption job better.  The new law makes them less so.

This is contentious because independence and autonomy are important.  But at no point did anyone propose abolishing the agencies outright.

The issue is that the agencies had apparently been infiltrated by Russian secret agents who had risen to positions of influence and power.  Thus they had de facto already lost their independent and autonomy — not to the Ukrainian state but rather to the Russian state.

That is not a claim that beggars belief.  The Russian foreign espionage services are trying to infiltrate literally every part of Ukraine and use their influence to turn Ukrainians against each other.  An independent watchdog agency with broad investigatory powers and intentionally very little oversight is an ideal target for that work.

However, people in Ukraine are very wary of any system in which anti-corruption investigations could be subverted by the ruling government.  So they have been demanding that the recent law be repealed or amended, and the problem solved some other way aside from the agencies coming under more direct central government control.

Naturally, Russian psy-ops and propaganda efforts have been trying to make the most of this disagreement.  But so far at least it is really just democratic politics playing out openly, in public.  Such disputes naturally can get a bit messy and loud, but so far it is all just part of the people of Ukraine working out how they want their nation to operate.",2025-07-23T20:27:37

You can’t fight a war of national survival against a vicious enemy and be a model of open government at the same time. Some protections have to be made. Fully independent anti-corruption agencies can too easily be targeted by Russians or others, to then take mischievous and damaging actions against government administration. The logical step is to put the anti-corruption agencies under the oversight of the Prosecutor General. These arrangements can be revised once the threat to sovereignty has passed. I see that adjustments are being proposed already, which is good.

Mostly independent, but requiring a certain amount of oversight and control, as all public agencies surely must.

The new law is not ""anti-NABU,"" in some sweeping sense.  It simply places the NABU and the SAP office more firmly under the direct control of the Prosecutor General.  The existing heads of these agencies are unhappy with that, which is not unreasonable... but they also have a really big problem right now.

The problem is that the national security service just busted several prominent members of the NABU and the SAPO for being Russian agents.  The bureau head and the Special Prosecutor have not, as far as I know, contested those allegations at all.  In fact the SSU claims that the agency heads knew about the allegations already but did not protest them nor act on them at the time.

This creates the impression that the agency heads knew about it, accepted it as true, and chose to do nothing until the SSU acted.

Needless to say this has raised some eyebrows.  The Rada as one of the main existing oversight bodies for the anticorruption agencies is bound to be unhappy with this revelation.

And it's very bad for an argument that you must remain unsupervised and nearly completely autonomous in order to remain pure and uncompromised, if it turns out that you yourself were actually thoroughly compromised all along.

So... what is going on?  Did the SSU make up the allegations?  NABU and SAPO do not claim so.  Is this some distraction to protect an anti-corruption investigation target?  Such a high-profile move does not seem likely to lead to less scrutiny.

Or... is it what it seems?  A serious problem with GRU infiltration, under cover of agency autonomy and independence from oversight, that requires rethinking how the agencies should work?",2025-07-22T21:12:19

Especially if, as the SSU claims anyway, the agency heads refused to ""do their own housekeeping"" when the SSU supposedly notified them of these infiltrations earlier.

Like... the agencies are already compromised.  That already happened.  It happened while they were independent and mostly autonomous.  Doesn't that seem like something already went wrong?

Maybe making them less autonomous isn't the answer, it is as always up to Ukrainians to decide on matters of how their constitution and government should operate.  But it seems that the way things were going before wasn't working very well.

1. Control over the negotiator = control over the results

Peace negotiations will require concessions: perhaps territorial, neutrality, amnesty, restrictions on the armed forces.

If various Ukrainian actors (reformers, opposition, prosecutors, journalists, civil society) participate in the negotiations, Zelensky's team loses leverage.

But if Zelensky’s circle monopolizes the negotiating team, documents, and communications, they can:

Hide concessions

Drag out or falsify internal consultations

Offer personal guarantees (e.g., amnesty for collaborators)

Form an international version of events

Remember how the Minsk agreements were signed — behind closed doors, without real control. This model may return.

2. Preventing leaks from independent structures

The National Anti-Corruption Commission, the Prosecutor General’s Office, and investigative journalists pose a threat to secret diplomacy.

If the agreement includes:

Compensation from Western funds for oligarchs or officials

Legalization of the loss of territories

Amnesty for collaborators

Guarantees of security from corrupt individuals

→ and this becomes known in advance — public anger may disrupt the agreement.

Closing or neutralizing these structures eliminates internal sabotage of the negotiations.

3. Avoid legal consequences after the deal

Imagine that Ukraine signs a peace agreement that:

Implements a ""special status"" or cultural/political zones of the Russian Federation in the East

Removes responsibility from collaborators

Redistributes confiscated property to achieve peace

The NACP or SAPO may regard this as abuse of power, treason, or illicit enrichment.
Zelensky's team needs to protect itself from:

Future courts

International tribunals (with internal leaks)

Political revenge after the deal

Without anti-corruption structures — without responsibility — deals can be concluded without fear.

4. Monopoly on information = legitimacy

Negotiations are also psychological warfare.

If the team controls the media, the prosecutor's office, and the parliament, it will be able to:

Present concessions as ""victory""

Discredit the opposition (""traitors,"" ""Kremlin agents"")

Sell a difficult peace as ""strategic patience"" or a ""phased return plan""

Possibility 1(Official): NABU was infiltrated by Russia. 
This possibility makes Ukrainian counter-intelligence, Zelensky's administration and Ukrainian government look terribly inept because either it took them 3 years of active war(when attention to national security should be paramount) to detect an infiltration of a major law-enforcement agency by agents from a country they are at war with, or they allowed enemy agents to infiltrate it in the middle of the war, which is just as bad. And the infiltration is so massive that it requires a dismantling of the entire agency. That's really bad. An obvious question from other countries supporting Ukraine would be ""If you had a breach of security this massive, how can you guarantee you don't have another one that you haven't caught yet? And if so, how can we trust you with any intelligence or classified material?"" 
Nevermind the fact that all the criminal corruption cases investigated and prosecuted by the agency can now be thrown in the garbage. Because what if they were fabricated to make honest and innocent businessmen and politicians look bad to hurt Ukraine?  

Possibility 2: Zelensky is consolidating power. 
The NABU due to their mission are supposed to operate somewhat autonomously, outside of the control of the office of the president, and even have the power to investigate the presidential administration and the president himself. Since Zelensky can't directly control it, he sees it as a threat and decided to use his emergency powers to eliminate the last governmental entity outside of his control. That's a worrying sign because that's a step in the direction of authoritarianism. 

Possibility 3: NABU uncovered corruption of someone very high up in the echelons of power who has influence over President Zelensky, or of a large enough group of politicians that they can exercise their influence over Zelensky as a group. And just throwing it out there, it's possible that NABU caught Zelensky himself and now he's covering it up. 
That's terrible for obvious reasons - either Zlensky is corrupt, or he's being manipulated by people who are corrupt. Not good either way. 

Possibility 4: Zalensky is sacrificing NABU as a scapegoat. 
If you follow what's going on in Ukraine from the Ukrainian sources(I worked in Ukraine, have family in Kyiv and speak Ukrainian, all that helps) then you'd know that Ukrainian businesses have been screaming bloody murder over being fleeced out of existence by never-ending taxes, fees, regulations, inspections and restrictions. For those who don't know, it's a regular practice for draft officers to approach a business owner and demand that he pays a certain amount otherwise they'll draft all his employees. Never mind that all the other inspections(like fire, safety, health, shelter preparation, etc.) are still going strong and each inspector needs his share. It could be that Zelensky asked to find a scapegoat to be sacrificed on the altar of public opinion and government bureaucrats were happy to offer their least liked agency. 

These are my explanations. If you disagree, feel free to suggest your own.",2025-07-22T23:13:43

LKA Berlin (a major german law enforcement agency of \~ 1200..1400 staff) was fully restructured for the misconduct of 4..6 corrupted employees (between 2000..2010). In this particular example the agency was subordinate to Department for the Interior.

The almost full restructuring was needed because the unit was exposed to bribery and coercion by the nature of their investigated targets, the prior given autonomy and with it informal practices reduced accountability, loyalty within the unit created a code of silence, leadership allowed the escalation visible in the detected incidents, the systemic issues made a shallow intervention useless.

I get that Ukraine is fighting for it's survival, it is total war for Ukraine. But their best bet would be to maintain or implement policies that their biggest supporters like. Ukraine is backed by the EU, UK, USA (limited), others, but no western democracy will see this and ignore it entirely.

Ukraine might get away with it because war, but that is not guaranteed. It just provides ammunition to political opponents (think Russian financed far right parties of any western democracy) of continued military and economic aid to Ukraine by the countries supporting Ukraine.

Take Andriy Melnyk in Germany as example. Great dude, passionate for Ukraine. But too much for the country. He got backlash countless times by the media and population. Not because he said something wrong, or because he wasn't right about the things he said. 

It honestly was a bit of pride and the slow government. Insulting the chancellor is a national sport, if he does it however, everyone is mad. Asking for more weapons all the time is obviously perfectly understandable. The government and media however took it as disregard to the many things they did and planned on doing and were upset. 

There is a very thing line in trying to raise support for your country, and not pissing of the country you are stationed in.

Just sayin'.",2025-07-18T20:16:16

This helps Ukraine's military industry, expand. I can't overstate how important that is.

The simple fact is war needs industry, you need your war industry in order to actually make the weapons, and you need the civilian industry, in order to keep the military industry going. Without the military one, you can't fight, without the civilian economy, your country literally falls apart as its economy implodes. 

What does this deal actually do for Ukraine's economy and industry?

It helps expand it, the US will buy these drones, and in return, Ukraine gets money and technology it needs, this money and technology allows it to both expand and modernise her industry. Which frees more manpower than any weapon ever could.

To give an example my teacher gave me, 50 years ago, a farmer would need a team of 150 people in order to tend the fields, which would then be sold and then given to the population. Nowadays, to tend the same field, you need 2.

2. 2 people, for the same field. That's 148 people freed because of innovation.

That money goes into Ukraine's ability to fight, it goes into their ability to modernise their industries, it allows them to focus more money onto the war effort, it allows more supplies for the front, more money to not collapse.

It also means, if that money was used for the industries, more drones, but less people, and that frees up people for the frontline, which is important at the moment, however, with more drones, you wouldn't need as many people, so more people could go to the civilian economy, which ultimately helps Ukraine in the longer term.

In the long term, over the course of 5-10 years, Ukraine could make billions of dollars, if the rest of the West wants these drones and Ukraine is willing to give them, you could be looking at billions of dollars worth of exports to the West, and that cannot be overstated how important that would be to Ukraine. 

If the US buys these drones, and continuously buys them, because you can bet your sweet ass they will as they're cheaper in Ukraine than America right now. That effectively makes Ukraine have actual influence over the US. Not the kind of influence that Russia has, actual soft power that could make the Ukrainians decide what the US does in some cases.

Basically, the US, and NATO as a whole, could see Ukraine do what the US did to NATO. Just on a much smaller scale related to drones. 

It also means that the US, and the Europeans, would have actual economic interest in seeing Ukraine survive, as well as military interest to see her prosper, because if she falls, you lose those cheap drones, and now you're in a worse position than ever before. On top of the fact you've also lost the technology that builds those drones, because a majority of that is in Ukraine, those cheap parts? Gone. Those cheap drones? Gone.

If the Ukrainian drone production moves to the US? That only secures the Ukrainian future, because now, if Ukraine then fell, what's not to say the Ukrainian drones production continues outside Ukraine and is then delivered to the Ukrainian special service, which would still be operating within Ukraine, and has been responsible for the almost guerrilla war that has been going on in Ukraine since 2022?

Basically, this deal, if Ukraine sells those drones, would massively benefit her, it would mean the West has more of a reason to keep her around, it would benefit the Ukrainian economy massively, especially during this time of all things considering she is in a war economy going into her fourth year, it would benefit her industry, her manpower, it would greatly increase her influence both across the West and in this war, and it would undermine Russia's ability to then occupy her even if she then lost. 

TL;DR: This could be the best thing that's ever happened to Ukraine.",2025-07-18T21:12:41

Ukraine is outnumbered in crucial places on the front line by as much as 3 to 1. Russia has concentrated over 100,000 troops on the Pokrovsk axis alone. Drones can kill enemy soldiers, but they can't hold territory.

Russia also has some very effective drone attack units, and wherever they get moved, we see them having success against Ukraine. Apparently one of their best units is currently operating near Pokrovsk, making it very difficult for Ukraine to keep their troops supplied.",2025-07-17T15:11:12

It's hard to get concrete information on exactly which Ukrainian units are deployed where. It would likely require moving elite units from elsewhere on the front to that area and flooding the salient with drones and artillery fire. But Russia is able to contest each of those steps. 

Finding a way to attack and degrade the Russian drone unit would also be very important, but Russia has massive numbers of drones available and no shortage of drone operators either. 

These difficulties are a big reason why Ukraine has shown little to no ability to cut off and destroy major Russian offensive salients in the last year or two. When the Russians push hard in a certain place, they simply have far more resources to throw into the fight and can stomach severe losses.

I think the best case for Ukraine here, unfortunately, is an orderly withdrawal from Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad sometime in the next few weeks.",2025-07-17T16:02:18

The Washington Post also reported that, according to its source, Trump asked the Ukrainian leader why he had not struck the Russian capital. Zelensky allegedly replied that such an attack would be possible if the U.S. supplied the necessary weapons.

""Volodymyr, can you hit Moscow? . . . Can you hit St Petersburg too?"" Trump said, according to the Financial Times, reportedly encouraging the strategy so that Russia can ""feel the pain"" and agree to negotiations.

The news comes as Trump seems to be warming up to Ukraine after months of a rocky relationship, offering advanced weapons to the war-torn country via a deal with NATO and threatening Russia with ""severe tariffs"" if Putin does not agree to a peace deal within 50 days.

The conversation reportedly took place during a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 4, only a day after the U.S. president talked with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Following the call with the Kremlin's chief, Trump complained he had made no progress toward peace and that Putin remained determined to continue his war against Ukraine.

According to the Washington Post, Trump considers authorizing Kyiv to use the 18 ATACMS missiles currently in Ukraine at their full range of 300 kilometers (about 190 miles) and supplying additional missiles.

The outlet also wrote that Trump previously considered supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, weapons capable of striking Moscow and St. Petersburg, but their delivery is not on the table at the moment.

After the July 4 call between Zelensky and Trump, Ukraine was provided a list of long-range systems it could receive via third-party countries, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.

Speaking at the White House on July 14, Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Ukraine would be receiving significant military support under a new U.S.-NATO scheme, including missiles and Patriot air defenses.

Ukraine has previously received a number of ATACMS missiles from the Biden administration, though it was given permission to use them on Russian territory only in late 2024. Trump criticized the decision to ease the restrictions at the time.",2025-07-15T11:20:17

Ukraine has been very careful not to hit targets that could result in civilian casualties; it could provoke negative reactions from European allies.

Neither Trump nor Putin give a damn about that sort of thing, and Putin might welcome a few such attacks in exchange for softened support for Ukraine. If Trump is suddenly suggesting that Zelenskyy do this, I’d be wary. He cannot—and should not—be trusted.

Trump is likely to complain later that Ukraine is “out of control” and deny he ever suggested this strategy. It wouldn’t be the first time he has denied support for something he once claimed to support, and he doesn’t much care if his prior support is on record, because he knows his sycophants will accept whatever he says today as the “truth.”",2025-07-15T13:31:38

Though as much as I hate to say this, I kinda agree that some pain should be dealt to moscow. Obviously Ukraine should not attack civilians directly. That's stooping to the level of the invaders. But maybe a little inconvenience like hitting Power Plants, Water Supply system, public telecommunication facilities? IDK. Just something to inconvenience them. IF there are spare weapons, which I don't think there is. The AFU has better targets for sure. With deeper hitting weapons, that opens up jucier military targets inside ruzzia.

That is not immediate action.  That is just words.

That is also not immediate action, it is still just words.

None of those things are action.

It’s just heartbreaking
This will not stop until they are thoroughly pushed back and put in place, and it seems to me this is only achievable through force.
Ukrainians living abroad because they had to flee their beloved home city even not get air raid alert notification 10 times daily, telling them to immediately find shelter as drones and missiles are incoming. The ones who left are out of harms way, but every time there’s a notification they are left wondering if their families are the next to be buried in the rubble.

I remember an especially haunting picture of people dead in the street in a larger city, fires and smoke in the background, and the dead were not in military or even work clothing… I especially remember one of the (young)  victims on the street wearing a pink soft shell jacket, now dead in a pool of blood in the middle of a busy street.

Earlier in the day, the president and First Lady Olena Zelensky arrived at the two-day event focused on mobilizing political and private-sector support for Ukraine's reconstruction. The previous three conferences have taken place in Lugano, London, and Berlin.

""We need a Marshall Plan-style approach, and we should develop it together,"" Zelensky told representatives of governments, international organizations, and businesses who gathered in Rome.

The Marshall Plan was an economic aid program that the United States offered to European countries after World War II to help them rebuild their economies.

""Rebuilding Ukraine is not just about our country. It's also about your countries, your companies, your technology, your jobs,"" Zelensky said.

Drawing comparisons to existing international coalitions supporting Kyiv's military efforts, he called upon international partners to form a recovery coalition and help Ukraine rebuild with a systematic approach.

""The way we rebuild our country can also modernize your infrastructure and industries. And I ask you to support the recovery coalition and help define specific financing mechanisms.""

Zelensky stressed that Kyiv would welcome only ""true partners"" in the initiative, ""those who are not helping Russia continue this war.""",2025-07-10T12:53:20

This will be the president's second meeting with the pontiff since his Vatican audience in May. Zelensky is also expected to meet with U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg and Italian President Sergio Mattarella.

The trip comes only a day before the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, which Ukraine and Italy will co-host on July 10 and 11. Zelensky is expected to meet Kellogg on July 9, a day before the event Reuters reported.

Rome is hosting the fourth Recovery Conference, bringing together political and business leaders to work toward Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction amid Russia’s full-scale invasion.

The event comes as Russia intensifies aerial strikes across Ukraine and mounts ground offensives along the front line, causing destruction and putting ever greater strain on the Ukrainain economy.

The challenge is compounded by the Trump administration's growing reluctance to sustain large-scale support for the war-torn country.

The Financial Times reported on July 8 that Ukraine faces up to a $19-billion deficit next year, linked mainly to reduced U.S. support and slim prospects of a ceasefire. A senior EU official told the outlet that many of Ukraine's partners had previously counted on a peace deal in 2025, but are now forced to revise their funding plans.",2025-07-09T11:59:09

It's as much as confirming he is advisor and as such of course influences the one he advices, thats what advising is. The rest implies accusations that are unproven and actually come from the Economist.

Guess how you'd attempt to discredit someone from outside if you can't find any other lever.

What officials, to whom at the Economist, non proven, yes, no, maybe, but anyway he is advisor. It also suggests Yermak holds an actual office to 'allow' or 'freeze', which he certainly can't, unless he speaks with the one he advises and that one does it.

In a system that shall be based on checks and balances it is totally unsurprising that investigations run, regardless against or for whom.. important is only that the process is lawful and strict following protocol and accused also acquitted if nothing turns up.

It might be rather an attempt to actually find out who requested investigations by accusing someone did so, forcing him to reject or confirm such claims.

For most things, you can get effectively infinite number made in about a year to year and a half IF money is not a problem. Infinite because the first step is building new factories

Chips are one of the hardest parts to source, there may be a few thousand in distributor stock but you can get a million from the factory with a 6-9 month lead time

Things other than chips, you can build a factory in around 6 months, and get it up and running in another 3 months or so. Automated production lines, one part rolls off the production line every minute

So I’m absolutely certain that there are people who, if you went to them and said “here is 50 billion dollars, I want you to make me a 10,000 Patriot missiles as fast as possible” would tell you “no problem, it’ll take about a year and a half” and would actually be able to deliver

1lskvki,Zelensky describes phone call with Trump as 'best conversation in all this time',cookiecutterhipster,2618,2025-07-05T21:40:26,DanielDynamite,2,"If you refer to Covid deaths, I still think that is a stretch pinning every covid death on him. Only excess deaths from wrong actions that were known to be wrong at the time. No country got through without deaths.
That being said, blame for US covid deaths should be shared amongst every administration since world war II for failing to make a system of free universal health care and for allowing the American population to become one of the most obese populations in the world.
Compare with Denmark and Sweden. Similar systems, populations, etc. Neither country had huge excess mortality but Sweden kept the society more open than Denmark. On the short term Sweden had more deaths but in the end, they actually had done better than Denmark. Even in the beginning, when Sweden had a lot of excess mortality, it was at levels that would hvae made it the third worst influenza season in 30 years, had covid been influenza.
The only way to have better statistics is by first spending a month or two suppressing all knowledge of this new illness that appeared in your country, disappear doctors that talk about it and then make a big show of how you are working hard to contain it, announce that only a few regions got affected but most of the country never had any of it and then fudge statistics so it appears that you had less deaths than countries with 230 times smaller populations.",2025-07-06T08:22:57

Sweden had more lax restrictions than Denmark. The two countries are very similar but Sweden ended up doing better than Denmark in the long run despite seeing more deaths early on.
The fact that many Americans can't afford to go to the hospital without facing bankruptcy and that the average BMI is amongst the highest in the world (making people more susceptible to serious illness) probably has had a bigger influence on amount of covid deaths than what restrictions were and were not imposed by Trump.

According to Zelensky, as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were talking on the phone on July 3, air raid sirens blared across Ukraine.

""Moreover, the first air raids in our cities and regions began yesterday almost simultaneously with the start of media discussions of President Trump's phone call with Putin,"" Zelensky wrote.

""This was one of the most large-scale air attacks – deliberately massive and cynical... Russia is once again demonstrating that it is not going to end the war and terror.""

The overnight attack struck Kyiv and several other regions, injuring at least 23 people and setting off dozens of fires in Ukraine's capital.

The company paid ~1m USD for operating in Ukraine. They provide services other than the distribution of pornography and have to pay tax to the state.

“Today, I also signed a decree enacting the decision of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council regarding the Ottawa Convention – the convention banning anti-personnel mines. Russia has never been a party to this convention and uses anti-personnel mines with extreme cynicism. And not just now, in its war against Ukraine – this has long been a trademark of Russian killers: to destroy life by every means available. They use chemical and ballistic weapons, including medium-range missiles, and various types of mines, including anti-personnel ones. Unfortunately, that is the reality. Of course, we see how our neighbors in Europe are reacting to this threat. We are also aware of the complexities involved in withdrawing from such a convention, especially during wartime. But we are taking this political step and sending a signal by it to all our partners – this is where attention must be focused. This concerns all countries along Russia’s borders. It is anti-personnel mines that very often have no alternative as a tool for defense.”

A day earlier, EU member states' leaders gave their political consent to extend the sanctions previously imposed on Russia for its war against Ukraine. Meanwhile, the participants did not approve the new 18th package of sanctions, which targeted Russia's energy and banking sectors, due to Slovakia's veto.

Zelensky's June 27 decree implements a decision by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council's (NSDC) to synchronize the sanctions against Russia with the EU and G7.

According to the document, sanctions approved by partner states must be submitted to the NSDC for consideration and approval no later than the 15th day after the partner state's decision comes into force.

The Cabinet of Ministers, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and the National Bank of Ukraine must also ensure the implementation of sanctions approved by international partners in Ukraine.

After the 17th package of sanctions against Russia took effect on May 20, Ukraine's allies announced the following day that another round of restrictions was already in the works.

Speaking after his meeting with Trump, Erdogan said on June 26 that the U.S. president expressed interest in participating if the meeting were to take place in Turkey.

""He said,'If Russian President Vladimir Putin comes to Istanbul or Ankara for a solution, then I will also come,'"" Erdogan told reporters. ""We will hold the necessary contacts and, God willing, realize this meeting as soon as possible.""

Zelensky and Trump met during the NATO summit on June 25, where the two leaders discussed battlefield developments, Kyiv's need for additional air defense systems, and the potential for co-production of drones.

Zelensky has previously voiced openness to a trilateral meeting. On May 27, he told public broadcaster Suspilne that he was ready to sit down with both Trump and Putin.

Putin has claimed he is also willing to meet, but did not attend previous talks proposed in Istanbul, opting instead to send lower-level delegates to peace discussions held on May 16.

The Kremlin has long sought to portray Zelensky as ""illegitimate"", with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in February claiming that any talks must consider ""legal aspects"" of his mandate.

Turkey previously hosted direct peace talks in March 2022 and has remained one of the few countries with open lines to both Kyiv and Moscow. The latest round of direct talks on June 2 was held in Istanbul.",2025-06-26T13:59:21

The wooden fence between her and my house is terribly bad, and therefore I planted a hedge, and I paid it. I planted it on my side of the fence..
And the next neighbor has the same fence, so... 
I just did it, I knew she was old, and I just moved in..
no big deal, and not a lot of money..

what did she say?..I mean yelled with fire in her eyes.. ""You planted the hedge 10 cm in on my land!!!.. 20 cm on your side of the fence belongs to me, understand?!!!!?? or should I call a gardener to fix it for you, for your money? shall I???
huh??..10 cm? I didn't know, I said ..you know what.. I'll move the hedge 25 cm in my direction no problem..
GOOD.. and maybe I can't see good, but you can't fool me.. and she left in slowmotion with her walker .. and yelled, my gardner will check up on it..

The White House confirmed the meeting on June 24 but did not release further details. According to a diplomatic source cited by AFP, the talks between Zelensky and Trump were scheduled for early afternoon, with both sides finalizing the agenda.

The two leaders are expected to discuss Ukraine's planned purchase of a new defense package, including air defense systems, as well as additional sanctions on Russia and an international price cap on Russian oil.

Speaking at a press briefing at The Hague on June 25, Trump was asked by a reporter what he would be discussing during the meeting with Zelensky.

""Obviously we'll be discussing his difficulties, he's got a little difficulty,"" Trump replied.

""Zelensky is a nice guy, I'm going to meet him today. I don't know, I assume we're going to be discussing Ukraine. It seems the most likely,"" he added.

Trump did not elaborate on what he meant by ""difficulties"" but the NATO summit comes at a time when U.S. support for Kyiv is waning, and just a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared ""all of Ukraine is ours.""",2025-06-25T11:10:04

""After the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, there was an uproar from Moscow,"" Zelensky said.

""The Russian leadership demonstratively condemned the 'missile and bomb' actions. Today, Moscow is silent — after its own army launched a cynical attack using Russian-Iranian 'Shaheds' and missiles on civilian infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities.""

Moscow on June 22 condemned the recent U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.

""The irresponsible decision to subject the territory of a sovereign state to missile and bomb strikes, no matter what arguments are used, is grossly violating international law, the U.N. Charter, and the resolutions of the U.N. Security Council,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Overnight on June 23 a devastating Russian missile and drone strike on Kyiv killed at least 7 people and injured dozens more, including children.

The attack was one of the largest air assaults on the capital this year, with 368 aerial weapons launched, including 159 Iranian-made Shahed drones and 16 missiles, according to Ukraine's Air Force.",2025-06-23T11:33:37

His entire career has been either getting his way or escalating until he gets his way. 

We can view the Putin regime as an *escalation machine* that would lose power the moment it backs down and refuses to escalate when challenged. 

This is the ideology of a gangster. 

Other side of the coin is that Putin doesn't know much about economics and can't fathom the idea that force cannot control the economy. 

He understands how force can make economists do what he wants in economic management, but he goes not understand that hard economic limits exist and will work against him ultimately. 

Unfortunately this strategy has worked for him so long, and for Russia generally in international affairs, that they know no other way, it's become culturally ingrained. 

It would've been like asking Hitler to stop blaming the Jews for everything. Wasn't gonna happen.

According to Zelensky, Ukrainian authorities have confirmed that at least 20 of the bodies Russia returned as Ukrainian were actually Russian soldiers.

""Sometimes these bodies even have Russian passports,"" Zelensky said. He also cited the case of a deceased Israeli citizen fighting on Russia's side, whom Moscow had passed off as a Ukrainian soldier.

""Putin is afraid to admit how many people have died. Because if the moment comes when he needs to mobilize, his society will be afraid,"" he said.

Zelensky's remarks follow the June 2 prisoner and body exchange agreement in Istanbul, the most extensive of the full-scale war. Under that deal, Ukraine recovered 6,057 bodies of its fallen soldiers. Russia, according to Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky, took back only 78.

Explaining the difference between the two numbers, Zelensky said that the bodies of the vast majority of Russian soldiers currently killed on the battlefield remain in Russian hands.

The same is true of any flexible ballistic material because of the physics of its mechanism of action. When a bullet hits a correctly-fitted Kevlar vest, it pulls on the threads of the weave, distributing the energy of the impact around the wearer's body. A loose Kevlar jacket would only distribute the energy over a few square inches, so much lower-energy rounds would be able to penetrate it, and high-energy rounds would do much more damage.

This jacket is absolutely not effective soft body armor on its own. It could possibly be a light plate carrier. The fabric could be an added layer of protection, but I'd bet it's just warm, practical, and projects the right image.",2025-06-21T03:57:39

Quality now is excellent.  When St. javelin started, they had to scale up very quickly from a journalist who wanted to print some stickers to raise money for the Ukrainian army to a full-blown clothing manufacturer.  The initial orders were sourced from many locations and manufacturers, they were not in house, St Javelin just made the designs.  They had no control over quality etc.  think sort of ordering a lot of printed tshirts from a Website or direct manufacturers and you get what you get.  some of the early stuff was good and some not, in particular I had a few experiences with the prints coming off.  But tshirts were like $30 or $35 then, not $70 or $95. Just looked and one i ordered in 2022 was made in Haiti. 

Since then St Javelin has taken manufacturing in house, and in Ukraine. Quality has gone way up, and pricing has too.

I found an article with several brands, but they are about his previous military look (maybe you can translate it with in-built google tools) https://marieclaire.ua/fashion/stil-volodimira-zelenskogo/

Brands I found:
- t-shirts - M-Tac
- vushivanka - Indposhiv
- shirt - Etnodim
- clothes he wore in Oval Office - Damiri
- shoes - Lowa

Wow, I found the thing you've asked: it is a custom thing from a designer Viktor Anisimov https://viktoranisimov.com/

As he doesn't want to stop it regardless he reveals his reign could get a real dent and even more likely come to a sudden end. And as he can't admit that simple face drop alive he must keep the paper tiger (bluff) up and find excuses, hence any repeated acknowledgment to the need to talk must be bound to another excuse, rinse repeat. So the dilemma already unfolds in slow-motion. With any new excuse he presents that he has no idea how to get out of it until his credibility is all eaten up, also by simply not winning it.

Which inherently reveals that Europe could actually push (a bit or also a lot) and has the cards for the speed of the outcome in its hands. So in short: he told us the west can decide if his reign ends sooner or later.",2025-06-19T02:12:44

See also the use of “proxy war” as chanted by their useful Western stooges, or the line “the US will fight to the last Ukrainian.”

Basically insisting that Ukrainians are NPCs and/or simple dimwitted peasants easily led astray by shiny foreign glamor such that they’re willing to fight, die, and sacrifice under the modern equivalent of the Blitz, in spite of really deep-down loving their old imperial masters. Because why else wouldn’t they want to be back under the Kremlin boot after 30 years of freedom?

This meant it used to have lots of money spare - despite the massive debt.

It's why most investors used to have at least something in a S &amp; P 500 tracker or NASDAQ and US Treasury Bonds used to be the go-to asset to reduce risk.   As Buffet used to say, ""Never bet against America"".  Under Biden, the economy grew about 2.8% a year and the economic indicators were all good.  There was a temporary rise in inflation due to the after effects of the pandemic followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Growth and moderate inflation - handled right - could have slowly reduced the debt.

Yet all that American voters whined about was how poor they were, how they were suffering and how much eggs cost.  People like Trump and Musk will never be the solution.  They are always part of the problem.   Because of them ""never"" has happened.   Growth for this year is projected to be at best 1.6% with inflation rising to 4% or more.   For the first time in a generation US Treasury Bonds have lost their AAA status.   Next year will be worse.  The yield is just going to get worse and worse as folks lose confidence in bat-shit crazy Uncle Sam - massively increasing the cost of servicing the debt.

Trump is making all Americans poorer - with the exception of his family, his cronies and the super-rich.",2025-06-18T07:05:45

The front is always going to be fluid until a decisive advantage is gained, and I think it will be Ukraine that gains that advantage.  Ukraine has motivation and ever improving technical resources on its side, and committed allies notwithstanding America.

I also believe per many past statements by the UA military that they are not ""wed"" to any little piece of territory.  Preserving their manpower is more important.  Yes, sometimes mistakes get made or situations are misjudged, but we have seen time and again Ukraine trade a km here and km there in return for thousands of Russian lives.  And yes Russia may still be signing up some new men but the core cadre of well trained troops is vanishingly small and the new fodder is being expended at a very fast rate.

Zelensky rejected claims of Russian advance as ""a Russian narrative,"" insisting that Ukraine's forces have been holding off a renewed offensive for nearly three weeks.

""The Russians are not so successful, to say the least,"" Zelensky said.

His remarks come amid a surge in Russian military operations across Ukraine's eastern and northern regions, including Russian claims of territorial gains in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts — assertions Kyiv denies.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Russian state media on June 9 that the offensive in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast aims to establish a so-called ""buffer zone"" on Ukrainian territory.

The statement followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier announcement that Moscow intends to create security corridors along Ukraine's borders with Russia's Kursk, Bryansk, and Belgorod regions.

Ukrainian officials denied any Russian advances into Dnipropetrovsk.",2025-06-12T09:50:47

Russian gains are immaterial at this time, and most likely will collapse or result in a very minimal change to the front line.  At the cost of thousands upon thousands of Russian lives.

Ukraine has different goals.  It is still in a rebuilding and transformative stage for its military.  So instead of being stuck on holding land it generally chooses a dual strategy of preserving manpower and exacting a high penalty to the enemy for the meters of land they give up.  And by all accounts it is succeeding.  No more boasting from Russian propaganda about endless tanks and IFVS.  And the Russian treasury and economy is starting to be truly impacted by the burden of the war.  It is not just tough times now for Russia, but only bleaker prospects down the road despite the bluster from Putin.

Up by Sumy I hear some mistakes were made by the UA regional command.  Its war.  It sadly happens.  UA revised some of its leadership structure taking this and other recent matters into account.

&gt;Mobilization is a problem in every war. Ukraine is no exception, as we want the war to end. People are getting tired. We can mobilize 27,000 people a month, while the Russians can mobilize 40,000 to 50,000 because their losses are greater. Mobilization is possible in our country because of the state of war. No one else has any experience in how to stop Putin. We were the ones who stopped him. You are right in that this is a difficult period. We did not mobilize 18- to 24-year-olds, but offered them one-year contracts. I have never spoken about this before, but since you asked, I will tell you what I think, because it is a sensitive issue: I do not believe that we should mobilize people from the age of 18, as the leaders of other countries have thought. Operation Spider Web has shown that it is not the number of people that matters, but weapons and technology. And money and exerting pressure. The sanctions would target the money that the Russians are using to finance the war. However, when it comes to sanctions, as Western partners list the reasons why they did not decide to impose them, they include that Ukraine did not mobilize people aged 18 and above.

&gt;To be honest, we gave 18- to 24-year-olds the opportunity to show that they can serve if our partners want them to. We have now given them that opportunity, in accordance with our legislation. But in the meantime, thousands are fighting on the front lines without adequate weapons.

You aren't really minimizing the risk and sometimes even increasing it, because operators are one of the first targets on the hit list.

Drones operators aren't far from the front lines too and they have bigger responsibility than an average soldier.

If they had dropped everything all at once, say slashed oil cap down to $30 immediately, there was a much higher chance that countries or companies would just ignore it completely as soon as they could or find workarounds. Plus, hitting a country like Russia in waves tends to be more effective than doing it all in one go. Why? Because waves create ongoing uncertainty. If you throw all your cards on the table from the start, Russia sees the full picture and can begin adapting; rerouting trade, building new trade alliances, adjusting strategy. But with staggered sanctions, they’re constantly guessing. That messes with their planning and keeps, especially their, markets jittery.

There’s also a strategic benefit for the sanctioning countries. Rolling things out step-by-step lets them monitor what’s working, plug any loopholes, and dial up the pressure when needed. It’s a more flexible and targeted approach.

And then there's the psychological angle. A single dramatic hit makes headlines, sure, but the effect fades. Ongoing waves keep political elites on edge, drag down investor confidence, and slowly chip away at morale. With the side benefit that those dickhead CEO's who thought their companies could weather the storm for a year or two and gobble up the market share of those who left Russia immediately, are now left out to dry even worse.

I know this is a very unpopular opinion but I think Zelensky and Ukraine's leadership at large are not doing enough to adres the manpower problem. 

It's not simply ""mobilize more people = problem solved"" Ukraine needs to adres the mobilization proces, the quality of its training and its command choices in order to stabilize the lines, minimize casualties and end the war on their terms.

There is also an ethical part to it. The men and women that grabbed an AK and signed up in February 2022, when the russians were at the gates of Kyiv, have been fighting non stop since then. 

They deserve to be demobilized after x years of service, go back to civil society, start a family, rest and heal. You cant expect people to fight for years with no end in sight except injury or death, whilst hundreds of thousands of adult men dont have to. 

  
To sum it up: 

* The front lines are thinly manned, allowing russians to push weak spots and make creeping advances. Giving them the idea that they're winning so they keep going. 
* Bad choices and micro management by high command lead to unnecessary casualties making the manpower situation worse (https://kyivindependent.com/azov-ex-commander-on-the-need-to-reform-ukraines-army/)  
* Training facilities are overcrowded and are of poor quality, which also leads to higher casualties because the recruits dont know how to survive on the front.  (https://kyivindependent.com/inside-ukraines-desperate-race-to-train-more-soldiers/ 
* The mobilization proces is poorly organized leading to poor results, demotivated recruits, more draft dodgers and even attacks against draft officers (https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-on-ukraines-draft-personnel-rise-fueled-by-social-tension-and-russian-interference/) 
* Mobilized soldiers and volunteers are not demobilized and have to fight until the end of the war or until they get injured or killed.",2025-06-12T14:53:01

""They even told our delegation: we know that our memorandum is an ultimatum, and you will not accept it,"" Zelensky said. ""Thus, the question is not the quality of the Istanbul format, but what to do about the Russians' lies.""

Zelensky said Russia's goal is to erode Western support for Ukraine and prolong negotiations while continuing military aggression.

The remarks follow the second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul on June 2, where the Kremlin submitted its memorandum listing conditions for a ceasefire.

According to Zelensky, the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul had a mandate to negotiate humanitarian matters such as a ceasefire, prisoner exchanges, and the return of abducted children — but not the country's sovereignty or territorial integrity.

""This is our own constitutional matter. It is my job to hold talks on territories — and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's, who seized them. I will not discuss my position on this with anyone else,"" Zelensky said.

1l3h85z,Following a previous post from SKC,Chip_Upset,216,2025-06-04T21:11:16,LefsaMadMuppet,45,"I find it interesting that those are dual mounts (and the TU-95 can have up to four dual mounts) but only two missiles per aircraft. The TU-95 has an unrefueled range of over 9000 miles, so it could easily have flown the mission profile with more missiles.

Maybe they are low on missiles? OK, fine. But if they are low on missiles, why waste so many flight hours on multiple aircraft? It would make more sense to load 4-8 missiles on one plane than 2 missiles on 2-4 planes. 

My guess right now is that the TU-95 bombers are having reliability issues and they are spreading the few missiles they have over multiple aircraft with hopes that a certain percentage will reach the launch point without issue. 

The damaged aircraft from this raid, even if they are no longer flight worthy, are worth their destruction to deny a dwindling spare parts reserve.",2025-06-04T23:03:02

They are video from this same raid on the tarmac that is covered by rain, and the other raid image with partly cloudy skies and a dry tarmac.

In both sets you clearly see mounted weapons, with several aircraft without missiles. I would say based on intelligence from several separate national assessment agencies, that the one that were not loaded with missiles were out of service, nor was n the process of preparation for loading of cruise missiles. 

Intelligence knew off an upcoming massive cruise missile and drone raid from the Russian into Ukraine. 

Ukraine decided to intercede and knock out the pre described attack.

Ukraine spent 18 months creating and implementing this plan. They decided to preempt the Russian swarm attack. 

The bombers have been tracked via satellite. Ukraine and other international intelligence agencies knew these long range bombers were being prepped for an upcoming attack.

Your profile, though old, has no content about the war until this post above. IMHO, I find it strange that you wait until an operation of this caliber, to take the time to undermine Ukraine and what they have done with this one mission. 

Have a beautiful day.

Then we see the raid where FPV pilots attack the exact spots.

It is difficult to take down and airplane with an FPV drone which doesn't carry much of payload. At worst, planes would get to expensive repairs for half a year. The war won't end in half a year.

So the intent was to breach the fuel tank and ignite the fuel, and the fire would do the rest. That's why the attack was performed before russian intended strike, so that all the planes are fueled to the brim and would burn like matches.

We know about the previous missile and drone attacks on russian airfields, also just hours before russians intended to launch a massive missile attack, likely with the same intent - to burn the aircraft on the ground.",2025-06-06T20:06:14

Two bridges in Russia’s Bryansk and Kursk regions collapsed overnight on May 31 in what Russian authorities have described as terrorist attacks.

Putin blamed Ukraine’s top leadership for the attacks: ""The current Kyiv regime does not need peace at all,"" he said during a televised meeting with senior officials. ""What is there to talk about? How can we negotiate with those who rely on terror?""

He added that the attacks showed Kyiv is ""degenerating into a terrorist organisation, and its sponsors are becoming accomplices of terrorists.""

Putin’s remarks signaled that Russia has no plans to declare an immediate ceasefire or agree to a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky — two key demands put forward by Ukraine during June 2 peace talks.",2025-06-04T16:06:42

The thing is that the Russians truly can't help but keep showing to us in the civilized world who they are as the proud guardians and de facto disciples of their erstwhile nomadic masters from the GоІdеn Ноrdе. They are the OG warmongers and without any external prompting validate the observation that every accusation is an admission. They do this as they flap their blood-soaked hands and stomp their unwashed feet about ""Western Hypocrisy™"", ""Double-Standards™"" or ""Russophobia™"".

Their history as ""Russians"" is [an unforgivably centuries-long reel of chauvinistic imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_Russia#Table_of_changes) combined  with a genocide of non-Russians every century or so. How else can anyone rational explain how a certain ragtag bunch of East Slavs originating from some swamps in the northeastern fringe of Europe just happen to have a ""homeland"" that now hogs 11 time zones from the Baltic to the Pacific?

The Russians, whether they have the guts to admit it or not, truly believe through their actions that the *only* path to civilizational greatness is to conquer everyone else and to extract others' wealth until stopped by man-made force or nature (i.e. an ocean). Until then, everything else is for suckers including what we in the civilized world take for granted in mutually-beneficial models for civilizational progress and socioeconomic development (cf. *Wandel durch Handel*) which do not invoke genocide and constant warmongering.",2025-06-04T19:00:37

All Russia has done and will do is try to murder civilians. Decimate their infrastructure. Hack their entire internet service and broadcast non stop images of dead Russians. Make THEIR civilians live in a perpetual state of unrest and fear. Russia is delusional and weak. Keep punching them in the nose. Stop asking for cease fires they won't give willingly. Beat them into submission. It is literally the only way they will stop. Destroy everything that makes their civilians feel like they are living a normal life and fighting a war that is just. Hammer them over and over in new and interesting ways. Make them paranoid and unsure. Eventually enough people will get sick of the bullshit and a window will open for them to remove Putin. Don't let up on them. Don't pretend there is some path to diplomacy. These people don't have any interest in peace. So bring the war to their door as loudly and as often as possible. Recruit disgruntled Russians to wreak sabotage on their factories and recruitment centers. Broadcast this shit globally. Keep repeating the truth through megaphones.

Check out the Wall Street Journal article that just ran, saying just that. Think about it. Three years ago when the war started, Ukraine had very little in the way of advanced weaponry and the Russians were bombing them with impunity. It was supposed to be over in three days.  Now, three years later we see rows of Russian bombers burning, 4000 KM from Ukraine. As an American who grew up during the Cold War, those Russian Bear bombers represented a threat and were designed to completely destroy my country. They were scary, because of both the brutish design and what they were designed to do. Seeing them burn and the one have the wing fall off, I must have watched that video 100 times already. This will go down as the turning point of the war, and it's clear to me who's going to win. It probably won't be soon, and there's a lot of fighting to do yet, but eventually Russia is going to crack. Just like the day we woke up to see all the bombers burning, one day we will wake up to an assassinated Putin, a revolution, something we weren't expecting and this is all going to be over. I will cry on that day, and they will be tears of happiness and gratitude for what Ukraine has done for the whole world.

""The Riddle of Steel""

https://youtu.be/P2EQ0FlVks4?si=OznbdQxieQ8rXbd0

&gt;Thulsa Doom: Ah. It must have been when I was younger. There was a time, boy, when I searched for steel, when steel meant more to me than gold or jewels.

&gt;Conan: The riddle... of steel.

&gt;Thulsa Doom: Yes! You know what it is, don't you boy? Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do. Steel isn't strong, boy, flesh is stronger! Look around you. There, on the rocks; a beautiful girl. Come to me, my child...

&gt;[coaxes the girl to jump to her death]

&gt;Thulsa Doom: That is strength, boy! That is power! What is steel compared to the hand that wields it? Look at the strength in your body, the desire in your heart, I gave you this! Such a waste. Contemplate this on the tree of woe. Crucify him!

Many of these were under-trained, poorly equipped or composed of older men and teenagers. It's a bit apple to oranges comparison, because Ukraine is unlikely to roll over entire russian territory, but it does show that the quantity alone goes only so far.

Besides economic collapse, there's also question of non-monetary cost. Russia just lost good portion of their nuclear deterrence capabilities which at this point is becoming their only state-level defense. They are losing the ability to fight internal revolts. They'd likely be hosed in case of something like 3rd Chechen war - they only won the second war by having considerable materiel advantage - especially in air and with artillery.

How much of the aviation can they lose to effectively have none? Look at Syria to see what happens when local militia with technicals is suddenly almost on-par (technologically) with russian army.

Personally I think that russia should have pulled out of this conflict much earlier. They could get very good concessions some time ago with a bit of diplomacy. So I do expect russians dragging this war way past what's reasonable for them just by being ambitious much beyond their real capabilities. I guess they assumed they'll be flinging drones across the border for years to come, but Ukraine just showed that the conflict is going to move onto russian soil and it's not going to be just the border regions.",2025-06-04T11:24:48

It's been in the face of western leaders and their citizens for decades, and yet most simply do not understand russian psyche or mentality. This is not a culture that honors their word. There is no deal to be made in a boardroom. Handshakes and contracts mean nothing to them. 

It's uncomfortable for some people to accept that russians seem to respond only to violence. If they punch you, you don't back down and try to talk them down. You punch them back in the face, then when they fall down and get back up, you punch them again. When they are on the ground, you step on their throat and make them beg for mercy. 

There no getting through to these guys with sanctions, visa bans, western politeness or the like. They only understand force, and force alone. How this hasn't been understood by the west in the year 2025 boggles the mind and is frustrating to witness. Perhaps we should listen to those who have felt russian boots on the necks like the Poles, Baltics and Ukrainians and actually listen to them when they say you have to force russians to submit on your terms.

Europe has made a lot of moves to get off of russian energy, hurting russia's energy exports.

Some countries will no longer buy russian arms.

russia has lost many skilled and educated people.

russia's military might has been shown to be a paper tiger. Only their numbers and reckless tactics give them any advantage.

russia loses if they don't to annex Ukraine.

Putin started this with the single goal of annexing Ukraine and has been saying it's the goal ever since. He has staked russia's and his own personal reputation on winning the war. Forced neutrality and forced neutering of the Ukrainian defense forces just delays this goal, allowing russia to reorganize and rearm.

Realistically, obviously nobody is expecting Ukrainian forces to march into Moscow. It was never an option and it will never be. Nobody wants to go one extra meter into russia if they can avoid it. The way russia loses is that they fail on their goal and it backfires, resulting in massive unrest back in russia.  
Just like tsarist Russia failed in WW1 and it was partly to blame for their downfall.  
Just like the fall of USSR was blamed partly on the failed war in Afghanistan.  
Both had other reasons as well but the failed military campaigns and the resulting losses were a catalyst that had significant impact on the start of unrest. It has happened before and it can happen again.

If Putin wins (annexes Ukraine), this is guaranteed to not happen. But if he fails (does not annex Ukraine), his throne is going to get very, very wobbly.",2025-06-04T06:58:05

Bernard-Henri Lévy4-5 minutes

By

Bernard-Henri Lévy

June 2, 2025 4:42 pm ET

The Ukrainian operation on Sunday was a coordinated attack on four airports in Russia reaching as deep as Siberia. It neutralized 41 “strategic aircraft” and was a brilliant technical performance.

Over more than 18 months, hundreds of drones were smuggled deep into Russia. They were loaded onto civilian trucks with double-bottomed trailers, where they were concealed inside mobile boxes. The tops of those boxes—remotely controlled by operators in Ukraine but connected to the Russian telephone network—opened at the appointed time, allowing the drones to take off. All 41 targets were carefully studied for months by Ukrainian intelligence, and they exploded simultaneously without civilian casualties.

This is the Ukrainian equivalent of the September 2024 pager attack in which Israel annihilated nearly all of Hezbollah’s active forces. It is one of those operations of crazy audacity and unparalleled ingenuity that make military history. It will be taught for ages in war schools.

This achievement was a slap in the face to Russia—and not the first. At the beginning of the war, there was the Moskva cruiser, the flagship of its fleet, sunk off Odesa by two Ukrainian-made missiles. Then, the double strike on the Kerch Bridge, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin)’s pride, the jewel of his cardboard crown and a symbol of the continuity he believed he was establishing between Crimea and Russia. Last year, half of Mr. Putin’s fleet in the Black Sea was destroyed. The other half retreated pitifully to Novorossiysk or the Sea of Azov. Also in 2024, Ukraine staged an offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.

Sigmund Freud spoke of the three humiliations on Western man—inflicted by Copernicus, Darwin and Freud himself. If Volodymyr Zelensky had the heart to laugh, he could speak of the five humiliations he has inflicted on that enemy of the West: Russia. Mr. Putin and his people stand exposed as braggarts, paper tigers. Ukraine is David to the Goliath of Russia, nearly 30 times its size.",2025-06-04T00:07:53
1l2pydn,Today the Wall Street Journal featured an opinion piece titled “Ukraine Will Win This War.”,TheRealMykola,3206,2025-06-03T22:52:16,regnull,25,"Sunday’s operation is further proof that the Ukrainian army, through sacrifice and adversity, has forged itself into the boldest, brightest and best in Europe. I witnessed its evolution as I prepared my documentaries on the war.

I filmed its geeks tinkering, hidden in forest huts, their first makeshift drones. For another film, the drone battalions of Lyman and Kupiansk closed the sky in place of their overly timid allies. This winter, in Pokrovsk and Sumy, high-tech command rooms where battles were fought at a distance. I even heard—at the time without fully understanding—Mr. Zelensky announcing that his engineers were developing a new generation of drones capable of striking Russia up to the Arctic.

Today, all the cards are turned. Mr. Putin terrorized the world with his nuclear blackmail. There was an army capable of calling his bluff—and it did.

“Just say thank you,” Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jd-vance) lectured President Zelensky during their February altercation in the Oval Office. All of us should thank Ukraine, a small nation that has grounded a third of the bombers that promised apocalypse to Warsaw, Berlin or Paris.

This weekend’s drone operation is a further step on the path to victory. I don’t know what form that victory will take, or whether it will be the front, the rear or its regime that will give in first in Russia. But the balance of power is increasingly clear.

On one side, a ridiculed general staff, an ultimate weapon that is greatly diminished and discredited, troops so demoralized that they fight only with the support of North Korean, Chinese, Ghanaian, Bangladeshi and Iranian mercenaries.

On the other side, a patriotic citizen army, motivated and knowing why it combats—an army that has proved its mastery of the most advanced military technologies, its excellence not only in trench warfare but also in the new remote and ghost warfare.

Ukraine will defeat Russia on the battlefield or impose the terms of a just peace. Either way it will win the war.

NATO has its tactic, that being, bomb the shit out of everything useful to the enemy and then invade, and it is incredibly effective, Ukraine is behind in tactics, the drones are the stopgap because of the breakdown of tactics, drones are very useful and can be useful against NATO, but NATO in war would make sure the drones either don't exist or whoever uses them doesn't exist. 

Ukraine is using the tactics they can because they don't have the ability to use NATO's tactics, it is simply too expensive, and Russia can always outproduce Ukraine because their economy is just that much bigger.

So Ukraine goes with where their strength, that being drones.

In the next war, they'll probably be the drone masters, the ones who use drones to help NATO.

They literally invaded Iraq, what are you talking about? Not NATO itself, but America and a group of countries invaded Iraq, and Iraq did have plenty of air defences, and they just didn't do much because the Americans planned and de-integrated them for that, sending drones forward, letting the Iraqi's shoot at them and then blowing them up with aircraft. 

NATO did lose a few aircraft, but the entire point is that, you neutralise the air defence before it even realise you're there, that's the point of stealth, and the F-35 is much harder to detect than the F-16 and other aircraft, and those were up against the Iraqi's in the Gulf war, and Iraq may not have super advanced AA defences

But F-16's are in Ukraine, and so far, no losses have been caused by Russia, hell, even Ukraine haven't suffered that many losses due to Russian air defence, and a lot of Ukraine's aircraft are old Soviet aircraft, which a lot of them aren't even designed for stealth.",2025-06-03T13:46:30

Mines are not American. we didn;t signed their cabal version of the treaty, roughly we only give up 50% of revenues from all future royalties related to resource assets.

Also, Russians can bypass places where those mines is situated, and that's it.

In terms of security guarantees we still have ""security assurances""  from Budapest Memorandum.

Also, USA calling article 5 over Ukraine? Don't make me laugh.

Why would they care if those mines will be in Ukraine or Russia, as long as they are safe and profitable for the US?

Mineral deal helped much for Afghanistan?

Russia is best frenemy of United States, USA constantly save their ass, USA doesn't care would Ukraine exists or wouldn't, only interest of USA right now is to bring back neutrality (min objective ) with Russia at all cost - if this will be Ukraine, they are willing to pay it. They are pretty much open about it.

All those ""economic guarantees == security guarantees"" wouldn't fucking work, because it would take ten+ years to start extracting, and Russia will attack again (in case of freezing the conflict)  in 2-5, add to this that a lot of people would just leave the country because they DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THIS BULLSHIT TRUMP SAYS ABOUT GUARANTEES.

We believed you once, when we gave up nukes for a piece of paper - where are we now? 20% country occupied, the biggest war since WW2 in Europe, 8 mln people left the country, the USA switched sides to Russia and demanded our capitulation.

Why should we believe again in something abstract and nowhere signed and ratified?

And this anger is not to the USA, but at the West in general. Because all this war is not only a fault of the USA policy towards Russia, it's the fault of all Western countries that ignored the threat for years, for years pumped money and technologies into Russia.

For context to those who didn't know yet, they didn't work in 2014 either

https://www.euractiv.com/section/eet/opinion/russia-s-silent-shale-gas-victory-in-ukraine/

&gt; Before the [russian invasion], Ukraine had agreements with the energy giants to explore and tap its shale gas fields in hope to reduce the country's heavy dependency on Russian gas imports. In the Donetsk Region Shell had a 50-year profit sharing deal with the government of Ukraine to explore and drill for natural gas in shale rock formations.

&gt;US energy giant Chevron also signed a similar deal for $10 billion, but it was focusing on developing shale gas reserves in the West of Ukraine. However, one year into the Russia-backed conflict, both decided to freeze or postpone their shale-exploring activities in Ukraine. Probably also driven by the low gas prices, the profit-oriented energy giants simply shied away from their shale projects in the conflict-ridden country, citing the lack of security for their investments and worsening extraction prospects as their main reasons.

&gt;According to Unconventional Gas Information Project expert Mykola Shlapak, it was indeed the fighting that scared Shell away from the Yuzivska project. “In the geographical sense there are two major regions with unconventional gas production potential. One of them is located in the east of Ukraine and is partially on the territories currently not controlled by the Ukrainian government, where the armed conflict is taking place.

What's the reason to believe they'd work now? With constant declarations of non-intervention and openly voiced fears of helping Ukraine too much resulting in WW3?",2025-06-03T19:37:14

The Russians themselves implicated themselves on this matter by matter-of-factly [admitting to their active participation in child trafficking under the guise of ""caring for"" Ukrainian orphans""](https://www.dw.com/en/how-are-ukrainian-children-faring-in-russian-adoptive-families/a-68138393). Only intellectually hopeless Russophiles not to mention stupidly proud Z-team cheerleaders would keep closing their eyes and ears to Russians themselves who keep giving away the affirmative answer to the question of whether the Russians abduct Ukrainian kids or not.

[The shameless self-admission of child abuse from some bitter (childless?) old woman in the town of Surgut](https://zmina.ua/en/media-en/russian-woman-admits-to-abusing-illegally-adopted-ukrainian-child/) nestled in the swamps of western Siberia is just one of the more egregious examples of this exercise in the Russians' latest genocide.

It's not Putin and the other siloviki who are the ""foster parents"" and ""camp counselors"" for the thousands of abducted Ukrainian kids scattered over the 11 time zones that form the oh-so-precious and irreplaceable ""homeland"" of the Gоldеn Ноrdе'ѕ heirs and guardians.

For the record, the only good Russians out there are the combined few thousand dudes in the Freedom of Russia Legion, Siberia Battalion, and Nomad Unit plus the few hundred civilians who've helped to cause smoking accidents or helped to smuggle out a few kidnapped Ukrainians.

It's sad that 1-2 losses aren't sustainable for Ukraine as those are impressive given they have to rely on a smaller economy. The upside is that Ukraine lost primarily cheaper IMV's that can be made from civilian donations while Russia primarily lost expensive vehicles. 


Pay attention what leaders do not what they say- Trump is just leading everyone on.  The assumed position should be that he doesn't want to do sanctions and that threats should be ignored. Hopefully Europe picks up some slack. The TACO comments might help here. ",2025-05-29T16:01:45

Russia has done a shitload of stupid things this war, but even they learn slowly. So ""50,000 troops"" (this is just some number cited by Zelensky; it could be completely off, deliberately or not. There could be no offensive coming at all, or in a different location. Take it with a grain of salt) are not going to be standing bunched up in one open field or driving in a giant exposed convoy along a single highway like during the initial invasion (never mind that the scale of that doesn't work out... 50,000 is a lot of people). That's not what 'massing' automatically means. Instead any operation of such a size will be conducted along **several dozen km** of frontline, with **significant depth** as well, and troops held further back in reserve.

Formations marked for the offensive may not be present in the trenches on the actual frontline at all until it starts in earnest, instead building up in the rear. Troops will typically be **dispersed** along a wide area, conceal their positions, place decoys, and dig some **trenches** at minimum, because you don't want to give your opponent an opportunity to take out thousands of soldiers with a single missile. That dispersion works against the concentration that is needed to breakthrough during the offensive itself, but it is necessary to make the survive in an age of very deadly precision weapons. 

The combination of *dispersion, concealment, and cover* on both sides makes it so that neither Ukraine, nor Russia can afford to use missile strikes on every single bit of trench that may have some grunts in it. There simply aren't enough munitions for that. The actual decision-making on what targets *are* worth spending what munitions on, are very freaking complicated and would take more than a few paragraphs to explain properly, so let me instead put it like this:

There's *always* 50,000 troops in another two dozen more places along the front, there's *always* hundreds of potentially very juicy targets for Ukraine to strike like nearly irreplaceable enablers/weapon systems/aircraft/infrastructure, and there's *never* enough unguided artillery shells period. Let alone enough precision weapons to wipe out a fraction of the (quite replaceable) 50,000 mobiks massing in ""some region"" that may be &gt;&gt;1000 km^2 big.",2025-05-28T14:56:41

It leads to a situation where people think that Ukraine can win off 'good thoughts and mentality'. 

Wars are not won by sending off men to perform an 'ultimate sacrifice' for their country, wars are won by making your enemy sacrifice it's troops. 'Sacrifice' is not a good thing in this context. 

The reason why Ukraine is taking so much casualties is because a large chunk of world is 'standing by Ukraine' instead of acting with it. More weapons we send, the more Russians can Ukraine kill, that's all that matters.

(sorry for the rant below, you can stop reading, but I need to get this out)

I am not from Ukraine (as many on this subreddit), but the common outside perspective mentality, seems to be that ""oh wars are won by sacrifice, but we are helping"". 

Help with what? We didn't send arms when they were most needed, now Ukraine is running out of men. And now we are just talking how Ukraine should make sacrifices? Fuck off with that bullshit. This shit was entirely preventable, yet people take it as something inevitable, but you know, ""we won WWII anyway because we were the good guys, no biggie"".

It's fucking infuriating, especially because Ukraine is forced to make that 'sacrifice' due to collective inaction of the western countries.

Russia launched 69 missiles and 298 drones overnight on May 25, according to Ukraine's Air Force. The attack killed 12 people, including three children, and injured more than 60, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.

Rescuers worked in more than 30 Ukrainian villages and cities, reacting to the large-scale attack, Zelensky said. More than 22 direct strikes were recorded, with additional regions affected by falling debris, the Air Force said.

""Without really strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will definitely help,"" Zelensky wrote in a post on Telegram on May 25.

Makes no sense, there'd be nothing in it for them.

Easy, China. China is already waiting to invade Taiwan, and are slowly stepping up support for the Russians. They don't want to see Russia lose the war, and open European involvement could easily push them to both step up their military and financial support for Russia and accelerate their timeline for invading Taiwan, which would potentially trigger a US response, and there you go, World War 3. 

Also, European nations directly fighting on the front lines in Ukraine would mean Russia would have the right to attack European military bases with missiles. Then one of those countries triggers NATO article 5, and there you go, World War 3 again.

I understand that doesn't feel fair to you. And you're right, it's not fair. But life isn't fair, and geopolitics certainly isn't fair.

The war technically ended right there with a DMZ similar to what the Koreas have, and it was written off as a job well done.

 The North waited two years after the U.S. left and made re-entry into the war illegal before they attacked the South again and the ARVN simply folded in half with little effort.

 Funny enough the reason the battle of Saigon took as long as it did is because when Operation Whirlwind was happening the NVA was in full hysterics because all they saw were waves of U.S. military helicopters over the city going back and forth and they thought a full fresh wave of U.S. ground forces were being redeployed rapidly and they knew they didn't have the manpower or resource to take on a freshly rested American military. 

 As the evacuation operation finished up and the NVA pushed in, Northern and Southern forces were actually walking up to each other with terms of surrender which caused mass confusion. 

 In the end Vietnam realized they were on the wrong side when their communist brothers in China invaded them next and they watched as U.S. backed South Korea and Japan exploded into world leaders both in technology and economy with the full protection of the U.S. military. It's kind of why they're now requesting the U.S. navy to port at their docks and sell them weapons to deter Chinese aggression.

As long as they can steadily keep bombing Ukraine, there will be no end to war. It can only end once Ukraine has the ability to conduct bombings on russian land to any location causing greater destruction than russia can counter and respond to.

My take on it as a lobbyist who deals with politicians is that the imperial dictator goal (likely Stephen Miller and the like pushing that mainly but Trump is all for it) of conquering greenland and canada and needing Russia empowered to the maximum to pull away European forces is actually interfering with the personal narcissist goal of pretending you are an important peacemaker worthy of a Nobel Prize (Bolton and others have specifically mentioned this wackadoo ambition of Trump’s). 

This results in the absurdity of Stephen “I quote Putin lovingly to Putin like mein führer” Witkoff replacing Kellogg so that there is NO chance of peace breaking out and so Russia remains a maximum threat to Europe. BUT. Trump cannot let his Nobel ambitions go and keeps setting up these pointless talks. Partially, Trump does it this so that in the event of peace, he can claim all of the credit for it to the annoyance of the parties as in India/Pakistan.

He loves profits. He is fine with short and sweet wars that gain easy money from the conquered. He called Putin a “genius” in early 2022 and personally advocates Manifest Destiny type aggression with America’s own neighbors. He’s a sociopathic bully. He’s also a coward. 


He dislikes wars of attrition, which happens when an enemy fights back effectively. In those circumstances, his instinct is not to fight on and stay the course, but to cut and run. Sometimes accepting defeat is a valid, smart move. But only sometimes, and usually only for the aggressor. And now it’s important we remember he’s the stereotypical dumb American. 

Americans have a warped perception of war. Many think it’s a choice. Because let’s be honest - it has usually been a choice for America. Defeats barely matter beyond the loss of ego.

Putin thinks he can outwait the decadent West. Fair enough. Never mind that their economy is much larger than his own, and while Russian revenue collapses, the West has largely shrugged off Russia’s flagging exports. If he is betting on staying power, he has likely already beaten America.


**But Russia is not fighting America. It seems that Putin has drunk his own propaganda**. Putin seems to think he is fighting Anglo-America and the EU. He plans around assumptions that are fever dreams. Because Putin refuses to accept the simple idea that Ukrainian nationalism exists. 

**Putin is fighting Ukraine. And here his strategy seems like nonsense**. Motivation matters in war, where soldiers are expected to make the largest sacrifice. Nationalists fighting with backs to the wall against imperialists have a very clear war aim. They usually have higher motivation and staying power, especially in the modern age of mass media and self-determination expectations. Historically, if I was betting on this sad war, odds say Ukraine can outlast one old tyrant. If Russia’s conscripts refuse to die in Ukraine, Russia loses. But even if Ukraine’s army collapsed tomorrow, all that would win for Russia is the largest insurgency since WWII.  

Odds of who can outlast who, do not favor the nation whose invading soldiers did not even know what they were fighting for.",2025-05-20T15:08:41

His strategy reflects FSB KGB assumptions about  nationalism and mass psychology, more than the reality of this war. 

Nationalists locked into existential wars of independence usually do not surrender. Not in the modern mass media age. 


Even if a leader like Zelensky wanted to surrender, that act would immediately be political suicide, leading to a breakaway resistance. We have seen that from Latin America to Spain to Yugoslavia to South Sudan and 100 other insurgencies. 

Nationalists do not surrender to imperialists. And those who try are tarred as Benedict Arnold traitors. And surrender has become even less likely after Russia embraced the brutality of a genocidal invader.

Just that, time. Time in control, time alive, time to keep playing things along to see if something breaks his way unexpectedly, time to delay the Russian people realizing just how horrifically he has fucked them and thus avoiding them rising up to murder him just like the Libyans did to Qaddafi, who died like a dog in a ditch. He has pushed things so far that there simply is no graceful way to back down with inviting unrest and regime instability.

Fundamentally, Putin is holding out because he thinks he can get a better deal entering peace negotiations at some point in the future (or never) than he can get right now. The costs to him of peace include increased regime insecurity. The benefits of the peace are limited to a fraction of what he hoped to achieve in Ukraine and represent a crushing humiliation for Russia compared to the expectations for their military performance pre-2022. The costs of continuing war are just more dead, ordinary poor Russians that Putin doesn't care about. The benefits include opportunities to seize more land and resources while further destabilizing the western political order that Putin so deeply fears and despises. He also maintains wartime control over the Russian people, including extraordinary powers over propaganda and internal security that represent dramatically curtailed civil rights for ordinary Russians compared to the much greater freedoms they enjoyed a mere 15 years ago, or even just before the full scale invasion, after which the Russian security services started tightening the screws on dissent aggressively. Also, the more soldiers that die on the front, the fewer veterans the Russian state will have to pay to rehabilitate, and the fewer potential disaffected Decemberist-style revolutionaries to threaten his regime. 

And right at this particular moment, the US negotiating strategy is remarkably stupid, in that it not only does not remove Putin's incentive to hold out, rather it actually enhances that incentive greatly. Trump has presented Putin with a win-win situation if he delays negotiating longer. Either he receives further concessions from Trump as Trump desperately struggles to bribe Putin to agree to a ceasefire, or Trump gets angry and washes his hands of the situation, leaving Ukraine and Europe at large with substantially reduced American security support and involvement. Either result would be an enormous victory for Putin.

Putin would **love**--and in fact **is loving**--to see the US withdraw from participating in European security by rhetorically and financially backing away from its support for Ukraine and for NATO, while drawing down the US troop presence on the continent. He sees the western order fracturing, with Europe too weak to stand up for itself and America too broken and stupid to protect the world order it created and which has ensured its geopolitical hegemony for decades. Why negotiate with an opponent who is in the middle of a self-destructing? If holding out only either increases the likelihood of the US abandoning Ukraine and Europe or of Russia receiving inordinate concessions from Trump, there's absolutely no reason for Putin to settle now, and plenty of reason to want to delay.",2025-05-21T04:15:12

The issue I am seeing at the moment is that russia is winning.... the information war. In different subreddits, youtube and comment fields in other fora, there is a shift to a ""russia is winning, this needs to end"" view, which is conveniently the common russian talking points. My question is, why do you guys think this message is gaining traction? It is not _just_ bots.

The way I see it is, yes, the US is a huge disappointment, but the combination of increased domestic production of weapons in Ukraine, the increase in production and donation from European countries, and the mostly European funded projects like the Czech ammunition initiative makes this mostly a moot point. The gap is anti air ammunition, and primarily Patriot missiles. At the same time that the influx of arms seems to actually significantly increase, russia is showing signs of actually in practice having run out of readily fixable equipment from soviet storage. Explaining the massive numbers in ""vehicles"" lost compared to tanks/IFVs/APCs. Ukraine has a formidable experience and drone army, and the current attempts at armored breakthroughs have been thoroughly smashed. The russian loss rates for each square meter gained has been steadily rising. Ukraine is heading towards artillery parity in available ammunition, and russia has never managed to make any significant captures without massive artillery dominance. So I, as a first rate armchair general, don't see any other outcome of the famed ""russian summer offensive"" than a failure, and a final culmination of the russian offensive actions. As long as Ukraine holds on, and support continues, the situation for russia will only get worse.

So why is the russian propaganda so effective?",2025-05-20T19:47:53

Trump is all about image. He’s going to go after whatever response that promotes the image he wants to project, which is a tough guy who has all the cards. The way I see it, Putin will make the mistake in challenging that and will give Trump the reason to support Ukraine and pressure Russia. 

This will leave Russia with the following options:
- total war
- not total war but committing more resources and more people
- find other partners to assist with resources and negotiations 
- giving up his demands


All this is dependent on China. I’m not sure of supporting Russia will be beneficial to their long term plan.

No way am defending Trump's stance with Russia but the US also has its hands full with the Taiwan straight issue.  There have been 5 large scale Chinese Communist Party military drills around Taiwan since Nancy Pelosi's visit.  China had just recently  the audacity to hold simultaneous live fire drills north of the Philippine-American Balakitan military exercises this past month.    Trump has put HIMARS in the Philippines and approved more missiles to Taiwan.

Russia is not interested in peace right now because it's moving forward to attempt the capture of Kostiantynivka.

As for its next objective after that, at least I don't think it has given up on taking Kramatorsk militarily.

Even if 2025 goes well for Russia and it does take Kostiantynivka, attacking Kramatorsk is impossible.

The earliest they can make a play for it is 2026, so I think that's the earliest they will look at a deal.

As much as I feel sorry for victims, it was kind of amazing to see a (relatively) large country completely revamp its defensive strategy in a span of few days - before images from Bucha surfaced, our “defense plan” was roughly to “stall and delay, up to roughly Vistula river, until allied reinforcements arrive, then gradually take territory back. 

After horrors of Bucha got uncovered, we basically switched to “not an inch of ground, motherfuckers. Even if we have to raze some neighboring countries’ areas to black earth. And St. Petersburg and Moscow, for good measure.”.

I don't really understand this comparison. 

Without wanting to defend Mussolini or his fascist government in Italy, historical research has established that he treated the native Jews in Italy and the territories occupied by Italian forces relatively well, at least in terms of their physical integrity (their civil rights and property, however, had been taken away from them in 1938). This comparatively humane treatment was a thorn in the side of the German Nazis:   
*""Unlike Jews in other Axis-aligned countries, no Jews in Italy or Italian-occupied areas were murdered or deported to concentration camps in Germany before September 1943. In the territories occupied by the Italian Army in Greece, France and Yugoslavia, Jews even found protection from persecution. The Italian Army actively protected Jews in occupation zones, to the frustration of Nazi Germany, and to the point where the Italian sector in Croatia was referred to as the ""Promised Land"".*   
*Up to September 1943, Germany made no serious attempt to force Mussolini and Fascist Italy into handing over Italian Jews. It was nevertheless irritated with the Italian refusal to arrest and deport its Jewish population, feeling it encouraged other countries allied with the Axis powers to refuse as well.""* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Holocaust\_in\_Italy)

Vance, on the other hand, could certainly use a concrete demonstration of the consequences of russian cruelty against the Ukrainian civilian population—but he doesn't even listen to his cousin, who fought on the front lines for Ukraine...",2025-05-19T13:39:56

Trump's amorality comes from his engrained narcissism and a rapidly deteriorating mind. Vance makes a conscious choice to be amoral, like how he chose not to reach out to his cousin Nate when he returned from fighting in Ukraine. Trump's a complete moron who has no idea what he's doing, Vance knows damn well what he's doing but doesn't *care*. I doubt Vance even personally agrees with anything he advocates for, I doubt he disagrees with those things either. He does whatever gets him the most power, being Trump's running mate and now VP fits his MO. 

Would anyone expect an obese octogenarian with apparent dementia and a diet consisting of McDonalds to even *survive* until 2028? If I were as nihilistic as Vance and given the choice between running for president myself and piggybacking off the guy waddling into his own grave who has what amounts to a cult supporting him, I'd go with the latter. It's the most efficient path to the Oval Office. I first had this hunch back during the campaign when Vance spread those rumours about the Haitian migrants eating animals. He pretty much said that he didn't believe it was happening so much as others would believe it. There were two outcomes either some dumbasses would believe him or it would sink Trump's campaign and Vance would benefit from both outcomes. Words mean nothing to him, they are simply *means* in and of themselves.",2025-05-18T16:53:34

1kplob0,President Zelensky met today with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome.,PjeterPannos,4020,2025-05-18T14:47:11,harperofthefreenorth,24,"Yeah, it's the entire schtick. At the end Vance gets to say ""well, the VP has to fall in line, so what could I do?"" All the while he's been actively trying to accelerate Trump's mental demise by feeding him bullshit, pulling bullshit himself (Vance knows damn well why Zelenskyy doesn't wear a suit, he's heard Zelenskyy say thank you to the American people *in front of Congress*), and letting the president surround himself with a bunch of whackos. Like, with the Greenland visit Vance *never* said he actually agreed with Trump's desire to annex the island, it was ""well my boss wants it so I guess we're doing it then."" If you pay close attention to how Vance has been speaking, he's always phrasing things along those lines. ""Well, the president says \[incoherent bullshit goes here\].""

Vance is the antithesis to Pence. While I don't like Pence that much and disagree with Pence on... well *everything*, he eventually realized that his President was insane and formed this impromptu coalition of adults with Barr and Esper... way too late but they did manage to make sure power was transferred to the Biden administration. The irony here being that Trump's erratic behaviour produced the ""Deep State"" he's paranoid about. Vance would have overturned the election just to make Trump look like a mad dictator. Really, because of how absolutely deranged Trump is it's impossible for him to distinguish between yes men and saboteurs *posing* as yes men. The Vice President is there to say ""no this is a stupid idea"" but Vance wants Trump to follow his stupid ideas to their logical conclusions. The dumber the President's ideas get, the more they harm the world, the better it is for Vance. For example, with Ukraine and NATO, Vance will pull a 180 the moment he gets behind the Resolute Desk and people are going to eat it up like you say.

In functionality, it's not all that different from how Putin took power after Yeltsin's incompetency, how Stalin managed to maneuver himself into succeeding Lenin. If you have the ambition, you can weasel your way to the top. Of course, I wouldn't say that Vance is like Putin or Stalin, he's more like the Millennial Richard Nixon. Like Nixon, Vance has no ideology beyond attaining power and like Nixon he's a cunning type. Hell, he's probably smarter than Nixon since Nixon managed to be VP for someone who served two terms and didn't reach the oval office for another two terms after that. Vance might not even need to *run* in a primary if he can get Trump slapped with the 25th.

Going into 2028 you could have an incumbent 44-year-old Vance, which is *insane.* Depending on how fast the administration implodes, he could become the youngest president ever, at most he'd be only the third youngest. Again, that's *way* easier than if he had run in 2024 himself.",2025-05-18T18:22:39

An encyclical is a formal letter issued by the Pope to the Roman Catholic Church. It is typically only on matters of doctrine, morals, &amp;/or discipline. It is usually only addressed to the bishops, however can also be directed to the wider Catholic community. It may even address all people of good will. Encyclicals often included global issues and offer (Roman) Catholic teachings on those issues. 

Only the following few Popes did not write one.

Pope Marcellus II (1555)

Pope Urban VII (1590)

Pope Leo XI (1605)

Pope John Paul I (1978)",2025-05-18T20:55:59

While it’s ostensibly addressed to the Corinthian church, it was pretty obviously designed to be an encyclical to the wider church. (Side note: many early Christians considered this to be part of a the Biblical canon, but it didn’t make the final cut).

------------------------------------

Essentially: 

The ""Vatican"" actually had far far more wealth and land area back a millennium ago, and into the middle ages--in which there were multiple land-regions throughout Italy that were deemed ""Independent Kingdoms"" and territory ruled over by the Pope and Catholic church, just exactly as the Vatican territory is ruled today. 

And for the most part, other forces back then respected those kingdom borders, and didn't generally tend to cross over the lines and invade. 

------------------------------------

Also very interesting side note: 

One of those regions has an insanely huge sized religious-palace, that probably rivals the Vatican in design and ornate artistry! 

In fact many movies are filmed there, including the recent ""Conclave"" movie, in which that palace was used/portrayed as the interior of the current Vatican! So if you watched that recent movie and thought, ""Ok, they must have filmed this in the real Vatican?!"" Nope: they filmed in just one of the former territory palaces. 

--------------------------------

Also keep in mind: this was a decision that the people going back about a millennium ago decided to make for themselves. 

Large numbers of people in the region of Italy just wanted to gravitate/convert to the Catholic church, and wanted the Pope and the Church to be their head of state, and they wanted to build huge religious palaces and churches in the region, and decorate those palaces/churches with works of art that are highly valuable today. 

Right or wrong, that's simply just what the citizens of that Catholic nation/region wanted to do! 

It was their kingdom/nation/borders. So that's what they did within their own borders. 

--------------------------------

BUT THEN... 

Outside and adjacent forces began invading/eroding that wealth and land, seizing it and holding it, and taking it away. 

And the reason they were able to take away alot of that territory is because the Church ruled kingdom often wanted to avoid war and killing, in those areas at least. They had some rather strong religious beliefs that tried to prioritize peace over war, but enemies took advantage of that in those regions. 

--------------------------------

So this continued, and even got worse after WWII, so that today: 

Only the Vatican remains! 

It's the LAST STANDING REFUGE of this centuries old nation. 

The Vatican is the last standing fortress against the regional forces that eroded the Catholic ruled nation over the last multiple centuries, in which the possessions/art/wealth of many of those regions were taken further and further back as they retreated. 

And so you see: That's why I think you got it backwards a bit! 

--------------------------------

Now, that said... 

If you're just trying to imply that the Vatican did some very bad things in the last few centuries, then I would agree with you! 

Sadly, the Vatican did some horrible unspeakable stuff to aboriginal people around the World, as well as horrific stuff to orphaned children. (I don't even want to tell you how bad that was--I've read a lot of details and it left me feeling depressed for months, that's how bad it was--but I think you probably already know some of it.) 

Anyways, in a positive hopeful sign: Pope John Paul first began apologizing for that to the aboriginal people, and visited them... 

And then the last Pope repeated the apologies. And hopefully this Pope does as well. 

But ya... I guess... Apologies/talk is cheap. Damage was done. 

Anyways... History is complex... And often depressing.",2025-05-18T23:09:34

Edit: 
Downvote me if you want to (as I see that coming) but I am a member of the LGBTQ community and I know people can change and I also know that the Vatican has never been as open as it ever has been in the last few years.

For example:

\- the historical meeting in the White House

\- the public peace and cease fire negotiations

\- the epic speech while walking alone over the streets of Kyiv around victory day

Furthermore, Ukraine is still standing in the 3rd year of the invasion. Perhaps that longevity has convinced hardliners who doubted he could keep up the fight. He has also never stopped visiting hospitals, schools and the front, which increases his reach over time, further increasing trust among a higher number of people.

And while it's easy to see how he appeals to those who want to win this war, he might nowadays also appeal to those who would accept peace and a degree of territory loss, because he has shown to be willing to be much more eager than Putin to enter in negotiations.

And there are those who might value his diplomatic skills in how he so far managed world class weirdo Trump.

Also remember that it's just a poll. We always have to be careful with rating poll results highly. You read a poll not by rating the exact numbers, but by identifying trends.

“Only Putin can decide whether the war continues or ends. That’s indisputable,” Mykhailo Podolyak told Russian journalists, ruling out talks between Zelensky and Russian ministers or negotiators.

“We understand how power is structured in Russia,” Podolyak said. “It’s clear that even people with formal ministerial status — or even someone like \[Russian prime minister, Mikhail\] Mishustin — are unlikely to be authorised to make key decisions.”

Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine would “do everything” to ensure that a summit meeting with Putin takes place in Istanbul on Thursday.

In a manner very characteristic of narcissists, he seems to have some unhealthy obsession with Putin, he sees him as a bro and a role model. Of course, they also align ideologically, but that can become secondary if he perceives some slight or betrayal from Putin. Narcissists can often do a complete 180 on someone they're obsessed with.

“I will be waiting for Putin in Turkey on Thursday,” Zelensky said in his daily address to the nation. “I hope that this time, Putin will not look for excuses … We are ready to talk to end the war.”

Zelensky’s offer came just hours after he had said there could be no talks with Moscow unless it agreed to a truce across the 600-mile front. “The very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire,” he said.

Putin announced at the weekend that Russia was ready to sit down for talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday in an effort to eliminate the “root causes” of the war. There have been no direct negotiations between the two countries since the early weeks of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022",2025-05-12T04:22:23

“Everyone in the world has been waiting for this for a very long time,” Zelensky said in a social media post in response to the Russian leader’s televised statement on Saturday night.

“There is no point in continuing the killings even for a day. We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire — complete, lasting and reliable — starting tomorrow, May 12, and Ukraine is ready to meet.”

Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, said on Telegram that first there had to be a ceasefire, “then everything else”.

 President Macron has stayed the distance and proved himself. That means everything and is why he is now a true friend.

For example the Russian border with Finland is apparently already de facto demilitarized.  Finnish border troops were reporting complete abandonment of sites on the Russian side during the first year of the war, even before the mass troop drawdown as Putin's folly sucked everything that wasn't guarding Moscow into the maw of the Ukraine debacle.

Now, you may ask, how did the Finns have such confidence in their assessment?  ""We would never sneak across the border and knock on the door,"" I'm sure they would say if you asked.  ""Stealing souvenirs from completely abandoned border posts on the Russian side would be an unthinkable provocation if anyone were caught doing it.""

He doesn’t spread his merchandise bullshit all over the tables every time his cabinet meets. He doesn’t have cronies who copy his dress and mannerisms. Nope. Not this president. He cares about others more than himself. President Zelenskyy is as true a leader as can be found in the world today. He makes the problems of his nation his own personal problems and then does everything within his power to find solutions no matter the personal cost. He doesn’t skip out and go golfing when his country needs him.,2025-05-05T23:04:05

Despite whatever the outcome our presidential elections will have you'll still going to have an ally in us since even if he wants our president can't get over the government in Romania. If he's trying he will be impeached by the parliamentarian majority.which is with you. 

Romania never made public whatever help it gave to Ukraine because we always liked to keep these things secret since forever. It's not a new thing. But I think the 70% of UA grains being transported through our ports is as good as a lot of ammunition, which we also gave. :)

If you can\`t reach the target with your missile then maybe move your missile closer to the target is what i sometimes think. For good vibrations at the right spot you sometimes need a hand to bring the rocket closer.

Because at the time nobody expected Russia to start full scale invasion? Spending lots of $$$ on program that wasn't expected to be useful wasn't best allocation of the limited funds. Ukraine is not USA that can throw immense amount of funds at their military programs.

The sanctions target Arestovych, a former freelance adviser to the President’s Office. Since his resignation in January 2023, Arestovych has positioned himself as a critic of the Ukrainian government and has hinted at possible political ambitions, drawing sharp criticism from Ukrainian officials and civil society groups, some of whom accuse him of spreading narratives that echo Kremlin talking points.

The restrictions were also imposed on blogger Myroslav Oleshko, political analyst Kostiantyn Bondarenko, and Dmytro Vasylets, the former head of the banned political party “Derzhava.”",2025-05-01T14:49:52

we need people in politics that ""dont want to be there"", so to speak, because people that want power, influence etc. are the worst to have in these positions.

elections should be about problems, not people.

and people need to understand that complex and difficult problems, require difficult and complex solutions that work in the long term. thats why populist politics are so easy, they only give simple, fast, easy solutions that dont work for long, or vice versa actually make problems and situations worse in the short term.

|**Behind Heads of State**|Royalty (Kings, Queens, Princes, Dukes — if not attending as Head of State)|

|**Following Rows**|Ambassadors to the Holy See (Vatican diplomatic corps)|
|**General Rows**|Government delegations, senior political figures, international organizations (like UN, EU)|
|**Public Seating**|Special ticketed guests, religious orders, and pilgrims from around the world|

Sadly there is little chance of that happening at the Vatican on Saturday — it will be an achievement of sorts if President Trump of the US even catches the eye of President Zelensky of Ukraine.

The reason is clear: a plan drawn up by Trump’s negotiators, largely to please President Putin, is essentially a declaration of Kyiv’s surrender. It has been carelessly drafted against the clock not to bring peace to Europe but to make it impossible for Zelensky to continue as the leader of a partitioned and permanently vulnerable Ukraine.

But I do think it's also important to understand that peace needs to be the goal here, and that the continuation of the war does hurt Ukraine a lot.

Oh, but he and over 140 million of his fellow Russians *are* interested in peace.

""Peace"" for these utterly unlovable losers means social ""stability"" via Moscow-centric despotism but with ethnic Russians at the top of a caste system in which they're ""naturally"" allowed to subjugate, enslave, exploit, and/or despoil non-Russians in perpetuity.

It's the Russians' fascistic and natively chauvinistic spin on [Pax Моngоliса](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica) which had its heyday 700 years ago when their ancestors native to the swamps along the Moskva river chose **dishonor** by becoming the most loyal ~~collaborators~~ bootlickers of the Gоldеn Ноrdе.",2025-04-24T15:49:43

Pretty sure that the population of Russia is no longer over 140 million.  Before COVID they had 146.5 million which included the population of the occupied regions of Ukraine.  They lost a bunch to COVID, a ton vacated the country to avoid conscription, several hundred thousand have died in Ukraine and the Ukrainians in the occupied areas shouldn't be counted towards Russia unless Ukraine officially cedes those regions to Russia (likely to never happen).  Combine that with the birthrate that is well below the replacement rate and it is highly probable that Russia is sitting below 140 million now.",2025-04-24T21:21:03

The plain and simple truth, is that we have negotiated, and the bully still attacked my son, there is no amount of damage that bully could cause that would convince me that my son should surrender, if my son wants to surrender, and actively does so, fair enough, but if he wants to continue, I will let him continue.

I have said it from day one, Ukraine should fight until they die, or Russia dies. There is no in-between, there is no argument. Russia has shown, every fucking time we've let them, they will just continue.

The Russian state and the Ukrainian state both came into existence around these borders.  There is no prior Russian claim to Crimea that matters, any more than there is a prior Turkish claim or a prior anyone else's claim that matters.

As Trump pressurises Zelensky to recognise Moscow’s control over the peninsula, Kyiv fears this would set a dangerous precedent and further embolden Putin. *Marc Bennetts, Kyiv, Thursday April 24 2025, 12.35pm BST, The Times*

For President Trump, the solution to the war in Ukraine is extremely simple: Kyiv should recognise the realities on the ground and put aside its objections to the Kremlin’s land grabs. For many Ukrainians, though, Trump’s demands are not only unrealistic but a threat to the very existence of their country. As he pushes hard for a peace deal before his 100th day in office, Trump has taken a sledgehammer approach to diplomacy, threatening to walk away entirely from negotiations and attacking President Zelensky’s refusal to acknowledge Russian rule in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that was annexed in 2014.

“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelensky’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. He said that Crimea had been “lost years ago” and that its status was “not even a point of discussion”.

For Kyiv, the recognition of Russia’s seizure of Crimea would set a “dangerous precedent” and only encourage President Putin’s appetite for Ukrainian lands, according to Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst who is seen as close to Zelensky’s administration. Although Trump’s peace proposal has not been published by the White House, a draft copy that was seen by Axios, an American media outlet, says that it would involve Washington formally recognising Russian control over Crimea and acknowledging its de facto rule in four regions in the east and south of Ukraine. Fesenko said: “If we have to choose between recognising Crimea as Russian and the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process, then Ukraine is more likely to be prepared for the US to pull out of the talks. For Ukraine, this is the lesser of two evils.

“Of course, these are potential risks for Ukraine in this. But we must understand that the risk of recognising \[Russian control of\] Crimea is much greater and more long-term than the risk of the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process. Crimea is a very serious and very fundamental issue for us. If the Americans agree to this, then after some time Putin will almost inevitably demand recognition of the rest of the annexed territories.”

In his Truth Social post, Trump said that Zelensky was not being asked to recognise Crimea as Russian territory. However, he suggested that he expected some kind of commitment from Zelensky that Ukraine would no longer challenge the Kremlin’s rule over the peninsula, a stunningly beautiful region where Soviet leaders once took their holidays. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” Trump wrote. He also appeared to repeat one of Putin’s justifications for seizing Crimea, writing that it had been home to Russian submarine bases “for many years”.

Putin has said that Russia was forced to seize Crimea to prevent Sevastopol, the home of its Black Sea fleet, from falling under Nato’s control after a pro-western government came to power in Kyiv in 2014.",2025-04-24T12:55:46
1k6qk1d,Why Ukraine would rather fight than give Crimea to Russia,TimesandSundayTimes,572,2025-04-24T12:08:05,DapperAstronomer7632,1,"### Sanctions against Putin’s regime would be lifted under the peace plan proposed by the US
The decision by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, to cancel a visit to London for talks on the war on Wednesday is said to have been made after Kyiv’s negotiators indicated that they would prefer to discuss a 30-day ceasefire than Trump’s blueprint for peace. Trump’s abrupt reversal of the Biden administration’s support for Kyiv in favour of improving ties with Russia has already made him deeply unpopular in Ukraine. His efforts to pressure Zelensky on Crimea have now provoked open contempt.

Illia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist, wrote on X: “This insane plan to blackmail and twist Ukraine’s arm — a scheme as foolish as it is detached from reality — will go down as one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of global diplomacy.” But not everyone is ready to write off Trump and his administration just yet. “Of course we are not going to give up on the United States, because the situation can change,” Merezhko said. “We need to work with Trump. Who knows, maybe he will come to his senses at some point.”",2025-04-24T12:58:04
1k6qk1d,Why Ukraine would rather fight than give Crimea to Russia,TimesandSundayTimes,572,2025-04-24T12:08:05,DapperAstronomer7632,1,"### Zelensky accuses Trump’s envoy of ‘spreading Russian narratives’
Tamila Tasheva, an MP who was Zelensky’s permanent representative for Crimea until last year, warned that “trading territory for a ceasefire” would not bring a lasting peace. “On the contrary, it could serve as a foundation for renewed aggression,” she said. “A precedent of conceding land to an aggressor would have far-reaching consequences for both regional and global security. The past 11 years of the occupation [of Crimea] have shown that partial concessions do not lead to de-escalation. Russia does not interpret them as compromise but rather as weakness.”

Fesenko said, however, that Trump’s threats and pressure on Ukraine could be part of a “psychological attack” by the White House aimed at extracting massive concessions from Kyiv in the shortest possible time. “So we have to wait it out, and hold out until Trump’s mood changes,” he said.
Although Zelensky has admitted that Ukraine is not at present strong enough to liberate Crimea and other Russian-occupied territories by force, he has said that Kyiv will strive to return them through diplomatic efforts. He has also said that Ukraine will discuss wider issues on how on resolve the war only after a full ceasefire has come into effect across the 600-mile front, a proposal that Moscow has not agreed to.

Crimea has held strategic importance in Europe for millennia. At the time of the ancient Greeks it was a boundary between the classical world and the untamed steppe. The Crimean Khanate, a Tatar successor state of the Golden Horde, was the primary power in the region for hundreds of years until Catherine the Great’s Russian Empire won the territory in a war with the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century.

Russia’s ambitions in the wider region met opposition from other big powers, including Britain, in an episode that culminated the in the Crimean War in the 1850s. During the Soviet period, Crimean Tatars were oppressed and deported to central Asia under Stalin, and Crimea was the setting of the Yalta talks that sought to reorder Europe after the Second World War. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the peninsula from the Russian Soviet Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1954. It is recognised as a part of Ukraine by a large majority of nations to this day.
Even if Ukraine wanted to hand over Crimea to Russia, though, there would be significant legal obstacles. According to the Ukrainian constitution, Crimea is an inseparable part of Ukraine and the government has no legal right to sign it away without a two-thirds majority vote in parliament and the approval of the Ukrainian people in a referendum. Another complication is that neither referendums nor elections can be held under martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in 2022.

“Ukraine will always act in accordance with its constitution,” Zelensky wrote, in an apparent response to Trump’s comments. He also posted on social media a “Crimea declaration” from 2018 by Mike Pompeo, then Trump’s secretary of state, which said Washington “rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea”. Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP who heads the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it was possible that Trump was putting forward “absurd” demands as a deliberate negotiating tactic and that he would lower them if Kyiv held firm. “This is the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic scenario is that [Trump] understands that Ukraine will never agree to recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea as legal and this is all a pretext to walk away from negotiations and to blame Ukraine instead of Russia.”

Although the White House peace plan is reported to say that Ukraine would get “a robust security guarantee” from its allies in Europe and elsewhere, there were no details on how a peacekeeping operation would function and no mention of any direct involvement by the United States. It also ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. “We need security guarantees, because without them this is a just a delayed death for us,” Merezhko said. “We need a guarantee of our survival.”

Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Ukraine has been reluctant even to discuss the plan, under which sanctions of Russia would also be lifted. In return, aside from the vague security guarantees, Kyiv would get back a small part of land that Russia has occupied in the Kharkiv region, unimpeded passage of the Dnipro river — especially in the Kherson region, where Russian forces are on the riverbank — and promises of compensation and assistance to rebuild.",2025-04-24T12:57:38

&gt;The Welles Declaration of 1940 was a pivotal diplomatic statement by the United States, refusing to recognize the Soviet Union's annexation of the Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This policy of non-recognition lasted for five decades and played a crucial role in enabling the Baltic states to maintain their diplomatic missions and financial assets during Soviet occupation. When the Soviet Union collapsed, the declaration's legacy helped the Baltic states re-establish their independence and gain international recognition.

&gt;In the context of Crimea, the Welles Declaration serves as a historical precedent for the principle of non-recognition of territorial changes achieved through force. It underscores the importance of maintaining international norms and could influence negotiations regarding Crimea's status by highlighting the long-term impact of such policies on territorial disputes and sovereignty.

If you disregard the monumental stupidity of ceding territory for what constitutes to a pinky swear for russia to end their aggression on this condition alone, it really is a very dangerous precedent to set for any future territorial wars, global peace, the rules based order and international laws.

And it is quite obvious to anyone who knows putins goals, has any understanding of russian ambitions and history, that this will only strengthen russia so they can restart a bigger war in a few years. This should not be allowed to be a short term vain political win for a geriatric reality-star who will die in a few years anyway.",2025-04-24T13:21:14

It's not even just that he doesn't care about the US and quite obviously only cares about himself.

I strongly suspect that trump is addicted to the high that he gets from making a deal. It's about ego more than money. It's about beating or crushing his opponent. And equally: he is a junkie. That would explain why he loses interest soon after a deal is made - mineral deal with Afghanistan for example - AND why he breaks deals to remake them bigger and 'better' - Canada Mexico for example. As soon as his high wears off, he needs another hit. It is never enough to satisfy. And the more dominant alpha/crushing that he can be - the better his fix but then he will always need an even bigger hit. 

Money? It's not as important. If it were, he probably wouldn't have gone bankrupt as often as he has. And he wouldn't lose interest so quickly after a deal is made. He very often fails with any follow through that is required for making money from his deals - even when a lot of money could be made. The Afghanistan mineral deal is a great example of this. Very soon after striking that deal, he threw the Afghans under the bus - completely sidelined them and made a deal with the Taliban... and we all know what was the result of that.

And of course that means he is the absolute worst type of person to make a deal with because he will never fill his cravings and he will always want to redo the deal in even more domineering ways (UA mineral deal for example - as soon as UA was on the verge of agreeing he massively upped his demands - he just wasn't getting enough of his drug). It seems to me that this is the perfect addiction for a narcissist. 

I imagine that not being able to make deals absolutely enrages him beyond any reason, too.

Costume is either a suit or a costume, like clown costume, depending on the context and he specifically used word - Costume.

As in I'll dress up as a clown for your entertainment when this is over.

It was a sharp and smart comeback that called out mockery without outright provocation.

I don't think Zelensky, not being a native English speaker and in fact sometimes visibly struggling to make his points clear in such a tense situation, was thinking about that nuance. 

I think what he meant was much more straight forward, as in ""I won't give a fuck about moronic formalities, protocols and ettiquete while my people is dying and your question is dumb fucking stupid and out of place, you fucking cunt""... just expressed in a way more diplomatic manner.",2025-04-20T10:58:28

I personally think that was another layer to his response and only people that speak Slavic languages picked up on it.

He don’t, this have been his formal wear during the war, and he have even explained why. 

So yeah.. it was a dick move by Trump, and saying that to the saudis or anyone else that came in their formal wear that was not tie and suite would also be a dick move. 

So Turkish guy point is Trump would not dear to do the same dick move (pointing out no tie) to the saudis. I think that point stands.

Turkish people feel very strongly about those who are fighting for their very existence against powerful invaders. 

We made great sacrifices at Gallipoli to stop the greatest invasion world has ever seen to that date. I think Ukraine’s losses just passed our losses at Gallipoli too.

Then we came to the brink of destruction ourselves when Russians reached few miles of Istanbul on one occasion, and then later Greek army was within 40 miles west of Ankara. 

Lot of Turks struggle with many hardships and their own problems at home -much of which is caused by Erdo- so they didn’t focus too much on Ukraine, not that we didn’t care but there was so much going on at home that it all looks like a big chaos 

But when Trump and his gang pulled that circus on  Zelensky everyone I know was outraged and furious. It’s a cardinal sin for us to berate and try to humiliate a man who is trying to protect his home.

The damage Trump inflicted on American prestige and image in such short time period is incredible. 

There may be a time when USA was respected as the good guy, WW2 and immediate aftermath, but it’s a far cry from that what’s happening now.

We just see them as that bully with high tech Air Force and nukes.",2025-04-20T06:37:18

The majority of Americans still support Ukraine, I don’t doubt it for a second, &amp; even those who are supportive of Trump no doubt shook their heads in total amazement at what happened. 

Zelenskyy didn’t deserve the way he was treated, it was a childish bullying attack, &amp; the fact that the bully’s, who didn’t even seem to grasp the very conversation in their own language, which brought it all about, &amp; who automatically chose the infantile, best line of defence is attack, strategy, brought shame to them, &amp; them alone, as by picking on &amp; blaming the very man who’s country Putin &amp; his Terrorists invaded, who’s having his people massacred, tortured, raped, molested, abducted, robbed, looted, his villages, towns &amp; cities turned to rubble by them, was the most cowardly &amp; disgustingly vile thing I think I’ve ever witnessed on that level, &amp; I believe what happened in that office will go down in history as one of the most shameful episodes in America History. 

Trumps utter stupidity around foreign affairs &amp; the absurdity of this meeting, along with Putin playing him like a fiddle, will leave an historical political stain on him like a white feather, in fact his behaviour has shown him finally for what he is, &amp; that’s a unworthy leader of a great country, a great country that has suffered generational Blood Sacrifice against Americas Russian &amp; Russian Proxy enemies, but yet who now seem to be Trump &amp; Americas friend, a total reversal.

Yet this chode has the gall to sit there as if his people aren't actively waging genocide on the Kurdish people?

The world sits by and lets Kurdish women be raped, Kurdish children be murdered and does nothing. But the US is the villain after giving magnitudes more than any other country to Ukraine and this fat slob jokes about politics as his country bathes in the blood of innocence.",2025-04-21T06:13:08
1k32cah,Liberal former Turkish politician Besim Tibuk on Trump’s Oval Office treatment of Zelensky.,kalbinibirak,3299,2025-04-19T18:03:24,Sensitive-Emu1,3,"No, there isn't any genocide waged against Kurdish people. You don't know what genocide means. There are proof Kurdish women raped by PKK members. There is an accepted fact by the UN that the PKK is a terrorist organization. Is someone raped? killed? Insulted? Tortured? That's possible. Governments and people who have power commit these crimes. But it has nothing to do with someone being Kurdish. Many minorities in Turkey, including Turks, experienced those. That's the effect of the Middle East. Even the USA committed those crimes in Iraq. The government didn't ask for it. But soldiers did.   
  
Anyway, this is not what I asked. I don't have any intention to educate you or change your opinions. I am asking why you think it's a good idea to badmouth Turkey just because this guy is Turkish? The topic is completely different. There is nothing related to Turkey in this conversation. This guy didn't commit any crime. Didn't share any opinion related to anything else other than Trump's behaviour. You are not helping anyone, including yourself. So I am asking what makes you think doing this is a good idea? What is your expectation from it?",2025-04-21T06:39:04

The new sanctions target 39 individuals and 60 legal entities, some based in Russia and China. The measures include asset freezes, trade restrictions, bans on property acquisition, termination of licenses and permits, and transit prohibitions.

On April 17, Zelensky previewed the move, announcing that ""two important packages of sanctions will be introduced tomorrow against Kremlin propagandists and Iskander missile manufacturers.""

Among those sanctioned are Ukrainian-born actor and singer Nikita Dzhigurda, Soviet-era clown Yuri Kuklachyov, and Russian actor Oskar Kuchera, all of whom publicly supported Russian aggression against Ukraine.",2025-04-18T12:10:45

Just in the radio news today:  
""Warning to US negotiators - Zelensky: Only we can talk about Ukraine's borders  
  
Ukrainian President Selensky has warned US negotiators against making unacceptable  
concessions in talks with Russia  
16.04.2025  
  
Only the Ukrainian people decide on their national territory, said Zelenskyi in Odesa.  
He accused representatives of the USA of talking about matters beyond their competence.  
In the opinion of observers, this referred above all to the special envoy Witkoff.  
The latter had spoken with Kremlin leader Putin in St. Petersburg last week and  
subsequently declared that a peace agreement would also deal with the areas  
that Russia had declared to be part of its territory.  
Following the annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014,  
these were the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia in 2022.  
Apart from Crimea, Russia does not fully control any of these territories.  
This message was broadcast on 16.04.2025 on the Deutschlandfunk program.""  
  
Translated with DeepL.com (free version)  
.  
While searching for a similar article in English I came across:  
April 15: ""Zelenskyy pushes back on Trump envoy Witkoff’s ""five territories"" remarks""  
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/04/15/7507723/  
And to my astonishment, also:  
April 16: ""Witkoff overstepped his authority when discussing Ukraine’s territory: Zelensky""  
Iran Front Page - ""... The Iran Front Page news website ... was established in 2014 after  
obtaining an official license from Iran’s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.  ...""  
Also there:  
"" ... US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin  
started the war against Ukraine, but he also continued to cast blame on  
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and former US President Joe Biden.  
...  
The remarks came as Prosecutor’s Office of Sumy Oblast reported the Russian attack  
on the city center of Sumy killed 35 people.  
...  
European leaders widely condemned the attack.""  
  
I am not saying that Iran is playing a good role in this war, and there is no free press either.  
Iran is traditionally anti-US and very probably there is no official information in Iran about arms deliveries to Russia.",2025-04-16T09:20:19

Let me just reiterate my comment from yesterday:

They went and voted that diaper-wearing, orange bum back in AGAIN! The same twat who, LAST TIME ALREADY, flipped the shitter so thoroughly that EVERY single American still has freckles.

This time, though, he’s got company: the ketamine-dusted, Temu-version of Lex Luthor.

Not to mention, an infantile, couch-humping man-baby with about as much foreign policy insight as a fucking slice of toast.

And let’s not forget their new Minister of Health—a man who looks like he’s already been prematurely embalmed. John F. Kennedy’s dear nephew honestly believes he can cure autism before September. (Wanna bet he blames vaccines or fluoride?) THIS is the same fuckwit now responsible for a medieval outbreak of measles. You’d hope maybe the CIA would broaden their repertoire and offer a family discount.

Meanwhile, one of their first official acts is to roll out the red carpet for a man wanted for war crimes… A guy who’s got his dick buried so far up Trump’s ass, the first person to pull it out would be crowned King of Israel. The US is now so invested in Zionazism that they think every single piece of land is fair game.

OH! And let’s talk about Trump’s talks with Putin, right over the heads of the Ukrainian people… Apparently America would appreciate if Bush had sat down with Bin Laden - or if Obama held talks with ISIS - OVER THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE THEY HAD JUST MASSACRED. 

*“They should just have struck a DEAL. A great deal with a great guy, or a great group, of FABULOUS people, who wants NOTHING MORE than peace in the world.”*

I mean… GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. 

And I haven’t even mentioned how America has now paused their own illegal deportations—for people working in hotels and the service industry. That’s like listening to Goebbels declare that Jews working in customer service are exempt from a train ride in a cattle car to the charming little village of Treblinka.

At the same time, most eligible voters are shocked to learn that tariffs and trade wars are basically just punching yourself in the nuts… while the MAGA-obsessed hillbillies are now whining because they’re getting fired from their jobs.

He promised you that he would hurt other countries, and you believed y’all would become millionaires overnight?

WELL GUESS WHAT?

A: Economics doesn’t work like that.

B: He doesn’t give an orange shit about you or your feelings—he’s laughing all the way to the bank.

Meanwhile, you’re left with the economy of a church rat, the healthcare of a Palestinian tent encampment, the supermarket prices of a Martian 7/11, AND you’ve become the laughingstock of the entire world.

Well YEEHAW—you got to keep your guns. (Hope that’ll help against all those planes you’ve got falling out of the skies.)

“Land of the free, home of the brave” MY ASS. You’re not even allowed unpasteurized milk. The only freedom you’ve got left is the right of any schmuck with a room-temperature IQ to own FUCKING ASSAULT RIFLES!? 

Meanwhile, you’ve got ICE agents picking people off the streets “Gestapo style.” And now they’ve started screening for people who AT ANY POINT might have criticized Israel—at the airport.

Tell me again how the right to own guns protects you, your family, your home, and your country? Because it sure as fuck looks like you just lost all of those things.

And now the rest of the world has to worry, because the US has gone from being a partner to being a nuclear-armed crackhead with mythomanic tendencies. All because of your medieval, piss-poor ideas of democracy—which, by any standard, do not match any other civilized country in the West.

You’ve gotta uproot every fucking inch of your ridiculous system. And then you MIGHT look like a semi-civilized African banana republic in 10 years.

This is some red neck dialect and comes from ""absolutely heard"".  
.  
Recently, there was a case that there was a top-secret chat  
in the top-secret Signal Messenger, to which journalist Jeffrey Goldberg from “The Atlantic”  
was invited for a top-secret reason:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_group_chat_leak  
When asked by journalists on a windy airfield about the undeniable,  
he also used ""absərd"".  
To have used ""absurd"" in this context would be totally absurd IMHO.  
  
Of course ""/s"" so far.  
""8D Vance"" is not a typo. 3D, 5D, ... chess. Here it's just 8D.  
.  
The ""ə"" that looks like an ""e"" mounted by a handyman having hangover  
is the ""mid central vowel""  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel  
Another example in English is  
written: ""rotten Putin""  
spoken: ""rottn Putn"".  
But even ""rottin Puton"" would give the same when spoken.  
There is some vowel, but it is spoken too short to tell whether it is a/æ, e, i, o, u/ø, ...  
and the linguist would write:  
""rottən Putən""",2025-04-15T13:35:53

The Russians' disgusting self-regard (and a good chunk of their history) boils down to a depraved and blood-soaked **myth** invoking the self-imagined mystical superiority of Russkiy Mir and the ""great Russian people"" self-evidently being a cut above everyone else which borders on the supernatural. It's a thoroughly Muscovite / Russian forerunner of the Nаzіѕ' take on the *Übermensch* from the first half of the 20th century.

Because the Russians are veering into the supernatural, it's not something that anyone in the civilized world can prove or disprove. Instead it depends on *irrationality* by being believed or not depending on how willing we are to apply the necessary mental gymnastics (for my part, *fuсk that noise* from the Russians).

But Trump insisted on putting restrictions on the missiles so they could never be used against Russian tanks.  Thats the part that gets lost.  The missiles needed to be kept in West Ukraine even thought the Russians were invading on the east.  Only if Russian tanks got through to west Ukraine could they be used.

That's why the very fist time one of those Javelins was used on a Russian tank was during the Biden administration.  Biden basically said, they bought 'em, they can use 'em.  Trump didn't do shit.

I fully expect Trump to sell the systems, but I guaranty he'll do something to neuter them.

Yep, Javelins were not used until 02/2022 due to the restrictions Trump put on them. And he was coaxed into giving them. 

I mean one was used during a training exercise in January 2022 (while Russia was amassing its troops on the border), which naturally led to a Russian hoax claiming it had been shot against them in an escalation from the Ukrainian side. 

It also seems relevant to mention that less then a year after the sale of these useless-until-full-invasion Javelins, Trump saw fit to ask Zelenskyy to help him win the election by creating evidence against Biden…

Though lets skip that example because someone's going to invariably claim it doesn't apply and all the ""old"" way of thinking is dead now.

So how about Afghanistan UORs? Yep. We totally didn't pivot on a dime for some equipment during that period. We absolutely did not suddenly scale up production in near record time either. Telling me USACE couldn't ""solve"" a production problem in record time tells me you've never worked with those weirdos. Give them a problem.. it *will* be solved. It might involve bulldozing half a state but it *will* be done. Of course the problem is amplified by recent economic attacks on our allies but we can hope those situations are overcome with time. 

The issue with seeker procurement was known before the first PAC3 entered testing. We elected to keep them rare because the patriot system inhabits a realm that isn't easy to replace. It was determined that a ready supply of these systems would decrease the need for US Military air protection and would inhibit our ability to strike targets in areas with high patriot coverage in Europe and other nations. 

TLDR We crippled the production intentionally because it chains nation to us for defense and it weakens those nations to retaliation from us should we require it. There is no reason those factories weren't overbuilt(as is policy for critical systems). We did this to ourselves.

France is the other one. They make their own shit. So buy it.

In the past, South Korea has sold to the USA and the USA has sold to others who pass it through to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy has to up his negotiation game and figure out a way to pry some air defence systems here. South Korea won't sell into active conflicts, but perhaps they'd work out a deal with Poland to manufacture their stuff under licence.

He liked ladybugs.
He was gentle.
He was innocent.

For power games.
For flags he didn’t wave.
For borders he didn’t cross.

April 10, 2025

Congresswoman Victoria Spartz  
416 S High Street  
Muncie, IN 47305  

Dear Congresswoman Victoria Spartz,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a proud Ukrainian-American, born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. My family’s history is deeply intertwined with the struggles faced by Ukrainians, as my grandparents escaped Russian aggression during and prior to World War II. My great-grandfather suffered a tragic fate, and my grandfather served in the Russian army under difficult circumstances.

I wanted to express my disappointment regarding your recent actions and statements. While I understand that your background includes being born in Kyiv, I feel that your current representation does not align with the values many of us hold dear as both Americans and Ukrainians. It is concerning to see what appears to be support for actions that many view as detrimental to our shared ideals of freedom and democracy.

I believe that President Volodymyr Zelensky embodies the spirit of resilience and courage, and I think it’s important to recognize the efforts of those fighting for justice. I sincerely hope you will reflect on your position and consider the impact it has on both our communities.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing how you choose to represent our shared values in the future.

Best regards,",2025-04-10T23:16:57

The second dude is likely used to working with foreigners as he's trying to relate a lot of data with accurate hand gestures. 

In his explanation of the accounts leading to his capture:

He was in a squad of five, him paired off with a Russian, the other three were two Chinese and a Foreigner. They got seperated in the chaos, he's not sure if the other three are dead or alive. He met up with another team, ""the 10th.""

He was laid out in a hole where his comrade died. And he is enveloped in a thick smoke/gas which was very dense and suffocating. He was in a daze and pretty sure he was going to die when a Ukrainian (水軍, Navy? Marine?) reached in and grabbed him by the collar. But then, he had already passed out.

Russia and China haven't had good relations since 1961, and China is still bitter about the lands Russia took 100-200 years ago.

Russia is also one of the most ethnically diverse countries on the planet, the only place you could say have real Russians is west of the Urals, and far-eastern Russia at Vladivostok. A lot of siberia is dominated by native Siberians, migrant steppe people from central Asia, and the Chinese/Mongolians. 

It shouldn't be weird that they would get foreigners to fight your enemy for you because they did the same thing in Afghanistan, they pulled out all of their Kazakhs and other central Asians and started using Russians to fight the Afghans since racial and cultural divide can make it easier and less demoralising to pull the trigger.",2025-04-08T18:13:28

Filming and distributing videos of Prisoners of War is a war crime.

Relevant article from the third Geneva convention which Ukraine signed in 2010:

&gt;ART. 13. — Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of war may be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation **and against insults and public curiosity**. Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited.

I support Ukraine in their fight against Russian aggression, but this article exists to protect both sides, because Russian troops might decide to retaliate, and this video doesn't really aid the war effort for Ukraine anyway. Russia will now have another example of Ukrainians committing war crimes, and during negotiations or for propaganda purposes they can state ""Hey! Look, we might bomb Ukrainian cities far from the front line and murder civilians, but Ukraine commits war crimes too!"". Then some Putinist asshole in America or Europe can utilize it to muddy the situation further and attempt to deteriorate support for the defense of Ukraine. Basically it doesn't help and can only really harm.

The small-scale incursion into yet another Russian region may be Ukraine's attempt to alleviate the pressure from the country's troops still fighting in the adjacent Kursk Oblast, military experts say.

Following Russia's recapture of the logistics hub of Sudzha in mid-March, Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw from a substantial part of Russia's Kursk Oblast, which was in Kyiv's hands for over seven months.

Now, using both mechanized attacks with engineering vehicles to clear obstacles and mines, as well as small-scale infiltration tactics, Kyiv has been attempting a new cross-border operation, said John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

He added that it is unclear which side controls the villages in no-man's land near the border.

""In general, it doesn't look like any gains Ukraine has made have been very significant in terms of territory taken,"" Hardie told the Kyiv Independent.

While it is too early to draw conclusions, the scale of the Belgorod Oblast raid and the proximity to Russian units already fighting in Kursk Oblast likely won't allow ""a huge diversion of Russian forces,"" according to Hardie.",2025-04-08T11:49:20

The article didn't mention it, but I will explain what is happening.

Russia are launching attacks over the Black Sea, where Ukraine lacks surveillance and front-line defence. If you go over land to reach Ukraine's interior, it is easy to stop.

By going over the Black Sea, they can fly right up at high altitude to Odesa or any coastal target without facing defence.

But that isn't even the worst part.

Their new strategy are drone and missile swarms. 

So they come up, undetected and undefended. Once they're in range, they drop an overwhelming amount of ordinance all at once, overpowering the defences of Ukraine. 

Sadly, Turkey will not allow any sort of military presence to enter through the Bosphorous, so sea-based defence platforms provided by the USA or EU cannot enter. It would be possible to send smaller ships via European rivers, but those lack the capabilities to intercept these kinds of attacks.",2025-04-06T23:37:37

With the way the Russians have chosen to view themselves and to construct their identity since emerging from the swamps of Muscovy in the 1500s, he won't be the last to call out the Russians' and their depravity, unfortunately.

See these [observations](https://vsquare.org/baltic-counterintelligence-officers-russia-cruelty-war-history/) by intelligence officers from the Baltic states, some of whom started their careers in the KGB when their respective homelands were under the Russians' filthy jackboots.

&gt;*However, officers of the Baltic security services do not describe Russia’s imperialism and brutality as a military tactic, but a rampant social norm.*

&gt;*„I believed that their mentality changed over the years and they had a reckoning after the war. That would have been normal,“ Jauniškis says. „But I was mistaken:“*

&gt;*Indeed, how could Russia have any reckoning when the country has never been held responsible? The Nazis temporarily rose to the top of the cruelty ranking during the Second World War, which has caused people to forget Russia’s atrocities.*

&gt;***„They’ve never been held accountable,“*** *Sinisalu says.* ***„And that has made them feel invincible.***

To be a Russian in the 21st century is to be a zealously hypocritical guardian of a gross double-standard in which *only* the oh-so-misunderstood Russians may get away with cheating and literal murder while  
**all** **non**\-**Russians** deserve only hatred and punishment for their misdeeds and crimes.

What's telling is that the Russians have *deliberately* worked in this century to subvert and shit on ""Never Again!"" of the last century.

For the past 15-20 years (i.e. *before* scratching their itch again to exterminate Ukrainians), Russians have increasingly bought into or quietly accepted the premise behind [Можем повторить!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pobedobesie#Propaganda_and_Putin) (**""We Can Do It Again!""**) which has been part of their trashy and bombastic parade for ""Victory Day"" on May 9.

The Russians celebrate not so much in outlasting the German invaders of WW II but more in *conquering* and *subjugating* millions of **non**\-Russians in Eastern Europe in the late stages of that war to set up the Cold War in the aftermath. It's clear as day that the Russians' idea of a Russian victory is for **non**\-Russians to lose or become the bitсhеѕ of the Russians. It fits neatly with their primitive view of life as a zero-sum game. For every winner, there must be a loser. When **non**\-Russians win then the ""great"" Russians must have lost. A Russian loss makes the Russians' pea-sized brains explode in vengeful rage even when the Russians are thoroughly in the wrong as they have been whenever they unilaterally commit genocide or start a war of aggression.

As their vile ""Victory Day"" crap shows, the Russians exhibit a militaristic death cult in which they genuinely glorify the sacrifice of the ~~heroes~~ [**hordes** of the Red Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_war_crimes#1944%E2%80%931945) to extend Russian tentacles into Europe by goose-stepping and meat-waving their way right to Berlin, Prague, and Vienna via Sofia, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest, Bratislava, and Warsaw.",2025-04-06T00:12:21

This is just like ordinary Russians who try to throw a pity-party by wallowing in [learned helplessness](https://granta.com/russia-verge-nervous-breakdown/) as their own kind repeatedly and openly humiliate and oppress them.

Should NATO members and the Chinese team up to occupy Russia so that the ""poor"", ""oppressed"" ordinary Russians will *finally* be liberated from their despotic rulers and self-generated societal rot of the last 500+ years?

The same goes for the ""Good Americans™"" now. Who's going to invade the US to save the ""poor"", ""misunderstood"" ordinary Americans? The Canadians? The Mexicans? The British?

The cheeto and his goons didn't seize power in a coup or revolt. They were duly voted in and enabled by millions upon millions of voters and **non**\-voters respectively without a shot fired.

This is the entire population of Lithuania. Reading it really hurt, I'm so deeply sorry for all these Ukranians. There will be brighter days, I promise.
It took Lithuania 50 years and tremendous battles to regain our Independence. But we did. Our ancestors and those still alive never gave up hope.

The world is different now, and you still have a huge part of your own country still free, sovereign, and fighting for you. And are supported, by a variety of meaningful ways, by many Democratic countries.
There will come a day when you can again proudly display your Ukranian flag, speak your own language without fear, and be free from this horrific oppression. Hold on to Hope, hold on to the incredibly brave souls of your own and those fighting for you. Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦",2025-04-03T22:33:55

However with Europe (not just EU) - the aid is intentionally given through smaller amounts while announcing the full some over time.
That's what benefits Ukraine the best - as instead of getting a huge sum all at once and not knowing when the next one will come, the smaller (but still very substantial) received aid allows to plan ahead while knowing more is coming. Apparently Ukraine's government asked for it to be distributed that way",2025-04-04T10:53:09

Putin is stupid enough to participate in this race, but if Europe shows determination, he has no chances. If it goes in that direction, EU can win without losing any soldier.


Surely, there are challenges on the horizon for Europe. But as a raw materials supplier, Mordor could develop only when there was no recession in Europe. 2008 hit them badly. They depended on Europe, not the other way around. Europe did not freeze without the gas from Mordor. ",2025-04-04T00:19:08

The narrative prior to this was that Ukraine would militarily reclaim the occupied oblasts but if it's now seen that diplomacy's the only way, the battlefield situation isn't looking great. Russia will never diplomatically concede the territory they've conquered either, unless there's a complete regime change. Even if Putin gets removed, some other nutcase will just take his place and make the same demands. ",2025-04-08T10:25:00
