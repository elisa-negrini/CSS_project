I read this week about Ukrainian units having a lot of success here by using drone dropped caltrops (an ancient anti cavalry defensive tool that is essentially spiked metal twisted up). The caltrops pierce the wheels of the motorbikes and ATVs that Russia has been increasingly using for assaults, rendering them useless. They claimed to have achieved a 66:1 casualty ratio between Russian and Ukrainian troops here, which sounds unbelievably high.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbvlbp7ik8gf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a2b2449a8d0458ddc7c3460ec22768163da1de\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtmuzfqik8gf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f89fb594646477ffa189eeec533cbb3e26f732\n\n* Russians expanded the grey zone west of Chasiv Yar, now covering the whole city, though I don't consider a city lost until it is entirely red. Still, that seems like it will happen any week now. Ukraine has fought long and hard for this city, and deserves a lot of credit for how long they have held the Russians here, just a few miles away from Bakhmut.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbkqt19jk8gf1.png?width=1099&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93327c015e2fdaa4a13cb1bd10f8a6eb9063fcfc\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf53t5pjk8gf1.png?width=1094&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8686ab7ee5a499ef1a47ba560528798edde251ab\n\n* More Russian advances between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and it seems at least one Russian assault group made it into the town of Pokrovsk itself before being driven out.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tmkcc0bkk8gf1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=929b8b2d8758a2bfad4d6ce82478a6fcae6aa663\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mqjib2qkk8gf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d0cb0b35cece561a2f650949744061dfe78c1d\n\n* Russians advanced here in three different places, though none of them are particularly large advances. This is tough defensive territory because there are no significant towns between Huliapole and Velykomykhailivka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump said that he is shortening the previous 50 days he had given Putin to come to the table, though he didn't exactly specify the time period (I saw 12 days being mentioned so I put that in the title). Still, he has been more and more critical of Putin and has repeated that he is the one who is blocking peace. He also threatened India with secondary tariffs if they don't stop buying Russian oil, which is very significant since India has been one of the biggest funders of Russia's war through these continued purchases. Trump and Modi have been very close in the past, so I was surprised to see him go as hard on them as he is, but I'm glad someone is finally trying to hold India to account for how much money they have supplied Putin with. India, as they love to do, is whining and trying to act like this is unreasonable, but what is really unreasonable is continuing to buy oil from a country that is killing thousands and thousands of people in an illegal and unjustified war of aggression. India is now being forced to take a side, and I don't see them ultimately siding with China and Russia here.\n* Under strong international and domestic pressure, Ukraine's parliament signed a law repealing the attempted gutting of neutrality for anti-corruption organizations. I'm still rather confused as to why anyone attempted this in the first place or thought they would get away with it, this whole thing seems like a big self-own from Zelensky, but I understand that he is under a lot of pressure from many different sides, and probably just made a bad call. Either way, it's good that they were forced to quickly recognize the error of their ways and repeal the law.\n* Ukrainian hackers hit major Russian airline Aeroflot with a massive cyberattack that halted the airline's operations and leaked tons of important documents. Russian media is now saying it may take as many as 6 months for them to fully restore their operations. Anything that causes disruptions of economic activity in Russia is very useful.\n* The Russian economy continues to face significant headwinds, as the Russian Central Bank runs out of tools they can use to continue their economic shell game where they move different debts around in order to keep the Russian economy moving. Non-military companies are facing increasingly dire economic outlooks, and British and European sanctions and aggressive enforcement against the Russian shadow tanker fleet are limiting their options for how they can sell their oil above the EU-imposed price cap. I don't expect anything to collapse overnight, but as I've said before, I believe that by the end of this year or the first half of next year, their ability to continue funding the war at the current level will be severely degraded.\n* Several major European governments are preparing to request billions of dollars in loans from the EU to purchase military equipment for themselves and for Ukraine under the new Security Assistance Facility for Europe program. Ukraine currently has tens of billions of dollars worth of military production sitting idle due to a lack of funds. If their military industrial complex was fully funded, they would be in a vastly better position, and it does look like that may happen relatively soon.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,432 (+35)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,082 (+7)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,076 (+5)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+0)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+0)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 163 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,493 (+61)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,232 (+6)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,430 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1053 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 611 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of greater overall Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russians, though it's important to note that in the most crucial categories of tanks and IFVs, Ukraine is very slightly below Russia, and many of Ukraine's vehicle losses are coming from easily replaced IMVs.\n\nThank you for reading!",

Only a few days later, the U.K. sanctioned 135 Russian oil tankers and two shipping companies linked to Russia's shadow fleet.\n\nBoth the EU and the U.K. also agreed to lower the price cap imposed on Russian crude oil from $60 per barrel to $47.60.",

There were rumors, even a hidden camera video with his brother talking about the price for appointing officials (not accusing, but proposing).\n\nIs he the *most corrupt*? I don't know. It needs a way to measure the corruption of different officials.\n\nIs he the source of corruption in Ukraine? Rather a minor one, but still one of those.\n\nWill the situation get better if Yermak is removed? I think so. Will it get better for Zelenskyy? I think he doesn't think so.\n\nWhy is Zelenskyy so dependent on him? Zelenskyy wasn't a politician and required someone to advise him. Yermak was his old friend (entertainment producer) involved in some politics, so he captured the place.\n\nThe worst part is probably that Yermak doesn't consider democracy to be a value but only thinks about misusing democratic procedures for his benefit. The good part here is that Yermak is only a president's aide, not an independent politician (and never will be one), so he will be gone with Zelenskyy out of his office.\n\nWith the possibilities open to Yermak, he could be one of the richest people in Ukraine by now (or make some of his associates such); we already had people like Kurchenko in the past. But it looks like his interests are elsewhere. Not sure where they are, though. Anyway, it's Zelenskyy's responsibility.",

Officer candidates must also be cleared by the General Staff or relevant military authorities.\n\nEach new recruit will undergo a two-month probationary period. If deemed unfit during that time, the contract may be terminated early. The law does not establish a maximum age limit for service, but all contracts will be voided automatically once martial law ends.\n\nUkraine faced serious manpower shortages in late 2024 amid a heavy Russian offensive in Donetsk Oblast. The Ukrainian leadership has sought to alleviate the crisis by broadening the mobilization pool and offering new incentives for volunteers.\n\nIn April 2024, Kyiv lowered the draft age from 27 to 25. In February 2025, the country introduced one-year contracts for 18-24-year-old volunteers with added financial incentives.\n\nThe new law is expected to help address staffing gaps in technical, logistical, and support units, where experienced professionals are in high demand.",

Ukraine might very soon be able to produce these interceptors in much larger quantities just as they managed to scale up drone production estimates for 2025, which range from 3 million to 4.5 million for 2025. Next year they will likely go beyond 5 million if we take industrial scaling into account.\n\nOne of the interceptor drones costs 1000 euros, and each shahed costs around 30.000 euros. If not more, it is hard to tell how much Russia pays for them. But this is the kind of ratio Ukraine would want to make it worth it from a monetary economic perspective.",

Ukraine’s Tryzub laser destroyed Russian FPV drones in April 2025.\n\nhttps://x .com/ Mylovanov/  status/1949160564363502054\n\nThese interceptors are just one of many different technologies currently being scaled up that will soon provide a much better defense capacity of Ukraine against these drones plus war can change quickly I still hope that Ukraine will also manage to scale up sabotage and direct kinetic and cyber attacks against Russian production sites.\n\nPlus, Russia is even more helpless against the strikes of Ukrainian drones as their land area is massive, and Ukraine and her allies are, of course, nowhere near the maximum of industrial scale in terms of their potential capacity. \n\nMuch more money and resources should be invested into the Ukrainian drone production sector, and Ukraine should be finally given a free hand to target these Russian drone production facilities with our missiles.\n\nIn total, to bring Russia to heel, a much more aggressive and less timid approach should be pursued as moderation in war is imbecility. It is violence in its essence. It should, of course, also be allowed and carried out to go after the worker quarters of these factories. Those workers have been a valid military target for the allies in WW2 and by working for the terrorist Russian military complex they make themselves a target and in these remote factories the mere destruction of the worker quarters even without the workers inside could proof quite effective.\n\nAnd Russian attacks are higher than before yes, but there is fluctuation and what is happening today is no guarantee for how the situation looks like in three months or 6 months war is highly complex and things can change quickly for good or worse so making any estimates on how the drone war will evolve and if Russia has the upper hand is not easy to assess unless we do it ex post to connect the dots.\n\nI see Russia fire a lot of their drones and missiles at non military targets, which is usually not a good strategy to win the war. And Russia keeps on creeping forward so maybe they should rather their focus on the military targets unless the only goal is to terrorise the population which will only result in more resistance by the Ukrainians and more support by her allies.",

And yes, it's despite the Czech initiative that brought about 1.5 millions artillery shells - russia had received about 7 millions shells from NK (most of which are probably Chinese shells marked as NK), in addition to their domestic production which is still larger than the Czech initiative. \n\n\nThe whole artillery war did not ended in the landslide only because Ukrainian drone teams targeted the artillery pieces as their priority target. But being often the ancient relic of ww2, many artillery pieces had survived the strikes - because otherwise 1000+ artillery losses would finish entire russian artillery park many months ago. \n\n\nThe biggest problems for a very long time (since at least late 2022 - almost three years so far!) is the massive short and medium-range anti-air that can target russian shaheds, cruise missiles and frontline bombers that use umpk bombs (that are usually misnamed as KABs). Umpk threat was the biggest problem on the Frontline for years, because they can destroy even well fortified positions - and russians launch them about 100 bombs a day. \n\n\nThe west has the abilities to counter these threats - from the delivery of required anti- air systems to the mission to protect Ukrainian sky as a plan of joint forces and direct involvement in the war. Russia cannot answer to these threats - it is very obvious they can't launch a war against any other country now, save for the entire biggest military power block. Yet Ukraine received none of that. Even russian recon drones that used to block the sun in eastern, southern and northern Ukraine - the eyes of russian military - they could fly undisputed until the recent development of Ukrainian anti-air drone interceptors that started to reap them by hundreds. \n\n\nThe indecisive stance of western allies, their preference of loud and empty words instead of actions louder than words, their populist rhetoric and their inability to put pieces together costed Ukraine so many lives, emboldened russia to continue the war no matter what, and recently emboldened China to commit to the russian side. We can be sure that recent uptick of russian long-range strike drones capabilities is solely the result of Chinese military-industrial complex backing them up. Without Chinese investments, russia had not the industrial capacity to scale them so rapidly. And recent answer of China to the threat of American sanctions shows that they are committed to their cause and honestly that they call Trump's bluff and don't believe he won't chicken out (and they have too many reasons to think that).\n\n\nAnd yes, I am grateful for every amount of assistance Ukraine had received so far. But let's be real: the whole western military support, while unprecedented, still hovers at just above hundred billions dollars, while russian and their allies' commitment is already in trillions. Unfortunately, at this stage of war the industrial capacity and spending are the most decisive factors, and let's be honest, western support is on the backfoot since 2023, while russians and their allies increase their commitment all the time. ",

        "body": "The biggest problem is not of a military but of a political and economic nature. The Western allies maybe with the exception of Poland and the Baltics and maybe Finland have no direct interest in seeing Ukraine win at least not in a decisive and quick manner. The political approach and the policy is to support Ukraine so that she does not lose and to bleed Russia dry in the process sadly at the cost of turning Ukraine into a nightmarish battlefield where for example in the Donbas the economy is finished for a long time now and other areas only survive due to Western money injections and by turning the Ukrainian economy into a war economy.\n\nHowever, in terms of tanks, for example, Russia maybe had a 1:10 advantage but surely not anymore given their losses and their moderate new production rates and depleting stockpiles as Covert Cabal and Himarsed have shown. But also Perun and others cited thet Russia can produce no more then 180 to 200 T90 M a year which is about as much as they lose within 1.5 months, the rest must come from dwindling and ever less sophisticated stockpiles of T 64 or T55 tanks.\n\nI think in terms of BT3s they manage now to produce around 600 of them per year, which is better but still by far not enough to make up for their losses which are roughly three times as high. \n\nIt is therefore also a quality and quantity discussion that we must have.\n\nIn terms of artillery the Russian army follows the Soviet doctrine mass over class and Ukraine is being trained by the West for over a decade now in point fire artillery such as Cesar systems or PZH2000 or Krab or their own systems of which they can by now produce about 12 to 14 a month and the scale will go up.\n\nIn the air and in terms of missiles, they still have a massive advantage due to the West being simply unwilling to change that there would have been enough time to massively expand production which has not happened.\n\nAnd yet the times in which Russia has a 10:1 advantage in most categories are over. And in terms of artillery fire it doesn't depend on how much you fire but rather on whether you achieve your targets with your firepower. \n\n\nWhen I look at the map and when I look at the same map 3 years ago, then Russia has been highly ineffective in making use of their once massive advantages and they still prove highly ineffective with their now much smaller advantage compared to let us say the period from February 2022 to at least early to mid 2024 when their advantages in terms of fire power and heavy armor were still much more pronounced than they are today.",

Answer: Ukraine has a large and well staffed administrative state, with layers of educated and trained deputies and experts outside the current government leadership. If they go down, someone else steps in. This is common, and is why Zelensky has been able to shuffle key leadership positions in his own office and in the military.\n\nSecond, is it possible to have a president of Ukraine who does not have corrupt people around them the let slide? Answer: Yes, eventually, as long as society remains mobilised and defends its independent press and power. Currently? It would be difficult, but possible. It would just mean a major internal fight.\n\nWherever it is pervasive, corruption is structural and endemic. Generally, corruption and other extractive economic and political institutions are self reinforcing. Gateways to advancement are guarded by the corrupt, with striking corrupt deals being the price for advancement. Ironically, playing the corruption game becomes critical for forming coalitions capable of challenging that corruption. To root out the corrupt, you have to go to war with the institutions of corruption that infect the state and business, which tend to invest heavily in defending themselves.\n\nLikewise, the corrupt tend to be powerful - which they have to be in order to succeed in their corruption. So fighting corruption means fighting powerful organizations who can and will do real damage if confronted.\n\nIt's particularly tough for Zelensky. Early in the war, Ukraine suffered some serious losses due to Russian infiltration - perhaps most infamously in Kherson, where Russia bought out local administrators to sabotage key defensive measures, allowing Russia to rapidly advance. But this is hardly isolated.\n\nIt would be understandable for Zelensky to put a premium on loyalty for his inner circle, given the critical importance of infosec and very real fears of assassination or coup. This is a *huge* problem for fighting corruption, however, as hyper-loyal lieutenants tend to be more focused on protecting and consolidating power than anything else, and that is incompatible with fighting corruption which requires strong institutions that either apply independent or popular pressure to uncover and defeat corrupt groups in government.\n\nThere has to be real fear, however, that Zelensky knew of and condoned some corruption in his government in the name of not having to confront powerful corrupt interests and instead bring them onside in the face of an existential threat. This has been a constant in history. Pitt the Younger and Henry Dundas would empathize. But that still poses a real political and strategic threat to Zelensky.",

Protest erupted (as expected, not hard to predict). Non-violence and Non-suppression are important, which Zelensky supported. \n\n4. Using the widespread protest as justification, consult with Western partners to revise the bill. Restoring NABU independence, but with the condition of stronger oversight for all intel agencies. \n\n5. Those who supported the original bill are now under public scrutiny, so they will be on their toes. If they don't wanna get investigated. \n\n6. The corrupt/traitorous elements in all intel agencies are also on their toes, no more immunity. \n\n7. Result: A stronger, democratic, less corrupt Ukraine. Basically, a partial detox/reset of the government and intel agencies. Gains more trust from the people and Western allies. \n\nDemocracy, freedom, and justice win.........and make RuZZIa look worse. \n\nWhat do you think? Was this the 4D plan from the start, or just a coincidence? \n\n\n\n",

(Heavy RuZ infiltration and corruption of NABU)\n\nThis was really only a scapegoat nonsense that has came up from the government and the administration. Aside from one or two cases, this is completely unsubstantiated.\n\n&gt;Protest erupted (as expected, not hard to predict). Non-violence and Non-suppression are important, which Zelensky supported.\n\nHe has to do that unless he literally wants his regime to fall. Loose the general public and you loose the soldiers on the frontline (whoa re fighting for the people, not the regime).\n\n&gt;Using the widespread protest as justification, consult with Western partners to revise the bill. Restoring NABU independence, but with the condition of stronger oversight for all intel agencies.\n\n&gt;Those who supported the original bill are now under public scrutiny, so they will be on their toes. If they don't wanna get investigated.\n\n&gt;The corrupt/traitorous elements in all intel agencies are also on their toes, no more immunity.\n\nThis is also nonsense, just back-justification of the mess the government created. They have to revise the bill cause if they don't, they'll loose support of their single most important ally (one on who's support now hinge even the US weapons), the EU. The whole administration and the whole Rada were for this, so now the whole government is under scrutiny per your post? Also, there was NO IMMUNITY for the NABU or SOBA, their employees could have been (and have been in the past) prosecuted for espionage and treason. Without shafting both agencies completely.\n\n&gt;Result: A stronger, democratic, less corrupt Ukraine. Basically, a partial detox/reset of the government and intel agencies. Gains more trust from the people and Western allies.\n\nNo cause it makes him look like a bumbling fool who tried to do a bad thing, got caught, spanked by the allies and by the people and had to back down. The optics Ukraine lost on this issue are not magically going back and the RU-supported propaganda machine is going to take full advantage of this.\n\nIt also created several really really bad situations - The taboo on war time protests was broken and if the Russians took the advantage of this, there could have been just a crapton of people killed. Russian propaganda has spun a ton of negative \"look ho corrupt Ukraine is\" stories that are very detrimental to the already worsening imagine of Ukraine throughout the EU. And the EU support faltered due to this happening, so the initiative to bypass Hungary on EU membership for Ukraine has stopped.",

Veneration to the point of seeing our leaders through rose tainted glasses is a tempting but dark path. The Ukrainian people evidently get this. It's a human instinct to justify actions of leaders; the leaders (kings, chiefs) have selected us for it throughout ages by killed dissidents.

We can all think of some obvious examples. The strongest democracies also are constantly being held back by loyalty from the people towards leadership. Concretely, for full democracies it takes the form of big old parties getting uncritical votes that they don't deserve based on their latest agendas or performances, for reasons such as apathy, habit, personal social dynamics, rigid ideology, or straight up principally misguided unwavering loyalty. It's on the people to continuously nurture a democratic culture that remedies it, and the longer it's been since it has experienced authoritarian rule, the harder it is to remember, and the easier it comes back. For flawed democracies, it takes the form of propaganda that fosters loyalty in the wrong direction.

The situation in Pokrovsk, however, remains critical. Russians were apparently able to advance into the city for the first time this week, though they were promptly expelled.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snshnby3xtef1.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb75dbe8d06ad57c7980f99861d1d672fb875348\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82352pj4xtef1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce4a3639d4b275e0231dad029ed9e840b1c57611\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* The Ukrainian parliament passed, and Zelensky signed into law, a controversial bill that brings robs several anti-corruption organizations within the Ukrainian government of their independence, which lead to the first anti-government protests in Ukraine since the war started. It's been difficult for me to figure out what exactly is going on with this bill. I generally trust Zelensky and don't think he's conniving enough that he would seek to reinforce his own power at the cost of the war effort, but fighting corruption is crucial for Ukraine to be able to build a good government, and independence is absolutely crucial for any organization that exists to destroy corruption. The claim of the Ukrainian government is that these organizations were infiltrated by Russian agents, who took advantage of their independence. I can certainly believe this on some level, Russia loves nothing more than ruthlessly exploiting weak points in an opposing nation's society and leveraging those points in bad faith ways to create more division. I can also believe that some individuals within Ukraine were scared of these organizations and jumped at using that infiltration as an excuse to gut them and protect themselves. I'm sure that the truth lies somewhere in between. Zelensky has since promised to do more to fight corruption, and he better be telling the truth.\n* Ukraine is turning more and more to specially designed air interceptor drones that can take down Russian Shaheds at a fraction of the cost of traditional AD missiles. Many of these drones are designed by a company run by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. They use AI in their targeting software and are highly resistant to Russian electronic warfare. I've seen claims that 9 out of 10 Shaheds that get downed in the latest attacks are hit by these interceptors, though that seems like a pretty high estimate to me. Either way, these drones are absolutely crucial to Ukraine's continued ability to defend itself from every more numerous Russian drone attacks.\n* The Pentagon announced a new security assistance tranche for Ukraine, the first since Trump was re-elected. This includes $9 million for the repair of Bradley IFVs, and also more Hawk AD missile systems. While it's a pretty small package, it's still a good thing that Trump is actually authorizing these now.\n* In another sign of changing priorities for the GOP, and how fecklessly beholden they are to Trump, many of the same MAGAs who talked shit about sending aid to Ukraine last year are now on board, and for the first time, more Republicans support sending aid to Ukraine than Democrats, with 64% in total saying we should send more. While I find it pathetic how easily they change their minds for Daddy Trump, this is at least a good sign. Another good sign was that the House overwhelmingly voted to continue providing military support to Ukraine last week, with a 353-76 vote.\n* NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the other day that Russia produces 12 times more artillery ammunition in one year that every NATO country combined, a stark reminder of the difference between a country operating on a war economy basis vs. those that aren't.\n* Increasingly, when Ukraine dismantles crashed Russian drones, they find that the vast majority or even all of the parts in them are made in China. In recognition of this reality, the EU has for the first time sanctioned several Chinese banks. Unfortunately, China has the power to completely sustain the Russian war effort on its, though right now their support is still fairly tepid.\n* The Australian M1 Abrams tanks have now arrived in Ukraine, and presumably will show up at the front reasonably soon. Australia has now provided more Abrams than the US did. These are good tanks, and while they aren't exactly a game changer anymore, each additional tank is quite welcome.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,397 (+56)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,075 (+4)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,071 (+10)\n* Russian SPG losses: 960 (+3)\n* Russian SAM losses: 340 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,432 (+85)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,226 (+9)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,426 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1036 (+20)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 608 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 172 (+1)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nUnfortunately, it's another week of higher Ukrainian vehicle losses than Russian ones. One thing that is worth pointing out here, which I've mentioned before, is that this is a sign of Russia running low on armored vehicles. Russia is also increasingly resorting to using motor bikes and ATVs in their assaults, which Oryx does not track. Ukraine, meanwhile, has large numbers of IMVs, both domestically and foreign produced, meaning that they can afford to lose more of them. You'd much rather have an armored car get attacked than a guy on a bike, because the bike guy is going to die with the bike, while the IMV is much more likely to save its occupants.\n\nThank you for reading.",

His approval rating fell from 73% to 22%. \n\nWith the start of full-scale war, the country rallied around him and people supported him in everything. There was even an unspoken agreement to forgive minor mistakes and not criticize the government, because it would harm the whole country. \n\nBut people still saw what was happening, and the audacity with which this law was pushed through in 24 hours was comparable to Yanukovych's attempt to renounce association with the EU (which sparked the second Maidan). This is what sparked the protest; it was a refusal to join the European Union, and that is a red line.",

I do not personally think he is himself corrupt but some of the people around him are shady. I dont think you can become wealthy and successful in ukraine withour having corruption around you. He shows loyalty to even those accused of it and i dont know why but i suppose it is really risky especially now during the war to not have people totally loyal for protection even if they are shifty. I also think it’s possible his consolidation of power before and during the war might be more a result of his thinking if he can control absolutely everything then changes will happen and he will know what everyone else is up to.

Until now the approach was individual: arrest the bad eggs, leave the institutions alone. It's certainly an interesting \"coincidence\" that he and his party rapidly pushed through this law NOW, right after it was announced that multiple high profile corruption cases were about to be prosecuted by these agencies against his personal inner circle.",

Quite the opposite if you listen to his previous comedy content carefully.\n\n- Rose to power via oligarch-linked media (1+1). Appointed allies of Kolomoysky. Delayed action on PrivatBank case.\n\n- Continued sweetly earning from Russian audiences after 2014 invasion - had production companies there.\n\n- Promised to end the war by \"just talking to Putin\" and \"stopping to shoot\". Ran on bizarre populist slogans, not actual plans.\n\n\n- Replaced actual reformers with loyalists. Judicial reform stalled. Filled top government posts with comedy friends and TV producers with zero previous expertise or competence.\n\n- The infamous \"barbecue speech\" to the public in Jan 2022 when asked about the probability of a full-scale invasion. \n\n- Wasn't able to answer a single question on government matters coherently in the 2019 - 2021 period. What you see now is a very different image to what Ukrainians saw before.

Disbanded or neglected some defence initiatives, leaving areas vulnerable.\n\n\nHis approval ratings were very low just before the war.

The recent law was intended to bring Ukraine's anti-corruption machinery under more direct control from the central government — not to abolish the agencies entirely.  That is just made-up nonsense.  They used to be highly independent and autonomous, in order to do their anti-corruption job better.  The new law makes them less so.\n\nThis is contentious because independence and autonomy are important.  But at no point did anyone propose abolishing the agencies outright.\n\nThe issue is that the agencies had apparently been infiltrated by Russian secret agents who had risen to positions of influence and power.  Thus they had de facto already lost their independent and autonomy — not to the Ukrainian state but rather to the Russian state.\n\nThat is not a claim that beggars belief.  The Russian foreign espionage services are trying to infiltrate literally every part of Ukraine and use their influence to turn Ukrainians against each other.  An independent watchdog agency with broad investigatory powers and intentionally very little oversight is an ideal target for that work.\n\nHowever, people in Ukraine are very wary of any system in which anti-corruption investigations could be subverted by the ruling government.  So they have been demanding that the recent law be repealed or amended, and the problem solved some other way aside from the agencies coming under more direct central government control.\n\nNaturally, Russian psy-ops and propaganda efforts have been trying to make the most of this disagreement.  But so far at least it is really just democratic politics playing out openly, in public.  Such disputes naturally can get a bit messy and loud, but so far it is all just part of the people of Ukraine working out how they want their nation to operate.",

Mostly independent, but requiring a certain amount of oversight and control, as all public agencies surely must.\n\nThe new law is not \"anti-NABU,\" in some sweeping sense.  It simply places the NABU and the SAP office more firmly under the direct control of the Prosecutor General.  The existing heads of these agencies are unhappy with that, which is not unreasonable... but they also have a really big problem right now.\n\nThe problem is that the national security service just busted several prominent members of the NABU and the SAPO for being Russian agents.  The bureau head and the Special Prosecutor have not, as far as I know, contested those allegations at all.  In fact the SSU claims that the agency heads knew about the allegations already but did not protest them nor act on them at the time.\n\nThis creates the impression that the agency heads knew about it, accepted it as true, and chose to do nothing until the SSU acted.\n\nNeedless to say this has raised some eyebrows.  The Rada as one of the main existing oversight bodies for the anticorruption agencies is bound to be unhappy with this revelation.\n\nAnd it's very bad for an argument that you must remain unsupervised and nearly completely autonomous in order to remain pure and uncompromised, if it turns out that you yourself were actually thoroughly compromised all along.\n\nSo... what is going on?  Did the SSU make up the allegations?  NABU and SAPO do not claim so.  Is this some distraction to protect an anti-corruption investigation target?  Such a high-profile move does not seem likely to lead to less scrutiny.\n\nOr... is it what it seems?  A serious problem with GRU infiltration, under cover of agency autonomy and independence from oversight, that requires rethinking how the agencies should work?",

And the infiltration is so massive that it requires a dismantling of the entire agency. That's really bad. An obvious question from other countries supporting Ukraine would be \"If you had a breach of security this massive, how can you guarantee you don't have another one that you haven't caught yet? And if so, how can we trust you with any intelligence or classified material?\" \nNevermind the fact that all the criminal corruption cases investigated and prosecuted by the agency can now be thrown in the garbage. Because what if they were fabricated to make honest and innocent businessmen and politicians look bad to hurt Ukraine?  \n\nPossibility 2: Zelensky is consolidating power. \nThe NABU due to their mission are supposed to operate somewhat autonomously, outside of the control of the office of the president, and even have the power to investigate the presidential administration and the president himself. Since Zelensky can't directly control it, he sees it as a threat and decided to use his emergency powers to eliminate the last governmental entity outside of his control. That's a worrying sign because that's a step in the direction of authoritarianism. \n\nPossibility 3: NABU uncovered corruption of someone very high up in the echelons of power who has influence over President Zelensky, or of a large enough group of politicians that they can exercise their influence over Zelensky as a group. And just throwing it out there, it's possible that NABU caught Zelensky himself and now he's covering it up. \nThat's terrible for obvious reasons - either Zlensky is corrupt, or he's being manipulated by people who are corrupt. Not good either way. \n\nPossibility 4: Zalensky is sacrificing NABU as a scapegoat. \nIf you follow what's going on in Ukraine from the Ukrainian sources(I worked in Ukraine, have family in Kyiv and speak Ukrainian, all that helps) then you'd know that Ukrainian businesses have been screaming bloody murder over being fleeced out of existence by never-ending taxes, fees, regulations, inspections and restrictions. For those who don't know, it's a regular practice for draft officers to approach a business owner and demand that he pays a certain amount otherwise they'll draft all his employees. Never mind that all the other inspections(like fire, safety, health, shelter preparation, etc.) are still going strong and each inspector needs his share. It could be that Zelensky asked to find a scapegoat to be sacrificed on the altar of public opinion and government bureaucrats were happy to offer their least liked agency. \n\nThese are my explanations.

As the battlefield intensifies and political pressure mounts, Zelensky opens up about Ukraine’s urgent defense needs and a potential high-stakes drone deal with the United States that could reshape the fight against Russia and the future of global warfare. Zelensky also reacts to former President Donald Trump's controversial approach to sanctioning Moscow, the 50 day deadline given to Putin, and shares surprising reflections on what he and Trump might actually have in common. With the future of U.S. support hanging in the balance, this wide-ranging interview offers a firsthand look at how Ukraine's leader views American politics, military aid and the stakes for global democracy.",

        "body": "That's a good point but here's an even bigger piece of it:\n\nThis helps Ukraine's military industry, expand. I can't overstate how important that is.\n\nThe simple fact is war needs industry, you need your war industry in order to actually make the weapons, and you need the civilian industry, in order to keep the military industry going. Without the military one, you can't fight, without the civilian economy, your country literally falls apart as its economy implodes. \n\nWhat does this deal actually do for Ukraine's economy and industry?\n\nIt helps expand it, the US will buy these drones, and in return, Ukraine gets money and technology it needs, this money and technology allows it to both expand and modernise her industry. Which frees more manpower than any weapon ever could.\n\nTo give an example my teacher gave me, 50 years ago, a farmer would need a team of 150 people in order to tend the fields, which would then be sold and then given to the population. Nowadays, to tend the same field, you need 2.\n\n2. 2 people, for the same field. That's 148 people freed because of innovation.\n\nThat money goes into Ukraine's ability to fight, it goes into their ability to modernise their industries, it allows them to focus more money onto the war effort, it allows more supplies for the front, more money to not collapse.\n\nIt also means, if that money was used for the industries, more drones, but less people, and that frees up people for the frontline, which is important at the moment, however, with more drones, you wouldn't need as many people, so more people could go to the civilian economy, which ultimately helps Ukraine in the longer term.\n\nIn the long term, over the course of 5-10 years, Ukraine could make billions of dollars, if the rest of the West wants these drones and Ukraine is willing to give them, you could be looking at billions of dollars worth of exports to the West, and that cannot be overstated how important that would be to Ukraine. \n\nIf the US buys these drones, and continuously buys them, because you can bet your sweet ass they will as they're cheaper in Ukraine than America right now. That effectively makes Ukraine have actual influence over the US. Not the kind of influence that Russia has, actual soft power that could make the Ukrainians decide what the US does in some cases.\n\nBasically, the US, and NATO as a whole, could see Ukraine do what the US did to NATO. Just on a much smaller scale related to drones. \n\nIt also means that the US, and the Europeans, would have actual economic interest in seeing Ukraine survive, as well as military interest to see her prosper, because if she falls, you lose those cheap drones, and now you're in a worse position than ever before. On top of the fact you've also lost the technology that builds those drones, because a majority of that is in Ukraine, those cheap parts? Gone. Those cheap drones? Gone.\n\nIf the Ukrainian drone production moves to the US? That only secures the Ukrainian future, because now, if Ukraine then fell, what's not to say the Ukrainian drones production continues outside Ukraine and is then delivered to the Ukrainian special service, which would still be operating within Ukraine, and has been responsible for the almost guerrilla war that has been going on in Ukraine since 2022?\n\nBasically, this deal, if Ukraine sells those drones, would massively benefit her, it would mean the West has more of a reason to keep her around, it would benefit the Ukrainian economy massively, especially during this time of all things considering she is in a war economy going into her fourth year, it would benefit her industry, her manpower, it would greatly increase her influence both across the West and in this war, and it would undermine Russia's ability to then occupy her even if she then lost. \n\nTL;DR: This could be the best thing that's ever happened to Ukraine.",

Systems like this are some of the most important anti-drone weapons out there.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2i3yk1rxfdf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d916be47e4261b06145dcc6dfb79cbcb5e4f2fa2\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyrzdz96yfdf1.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4caaa4668008cbb756479547545e20d1df4553f8\n\n* No significant changes here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10p4o0e8yfdf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d44129de715cccf8ca9f12302d84bed8d2b6f3aa\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngdm0b49yfdf1.png?width=860&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=524f2d85b29ebbeeb85560e73ee634f84f8db4b2\n\n* No changes here.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l06k3j4byfdf1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77bd9b971fed6f19940127e4d555cbb81fcdae2b\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bokk4iobyfdf1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0adeae5c755d30755c2a3f777eaa3ef91c384153\n\n* Small advance made by the Russians in the salient north of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjx537ngyfdf1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b84210da4fcd3f3ca31be95f933bbcd988d65a4\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsxvow8hyfdf1.png?width=832&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8fdac371d4a43265bd89f4a90be873abefbd727\n\n* Russia advanced to close a gap in their lines south of Chasiv Yar.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnpkt6nlyfdf1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf58014673b117d69648fb5cf8f029640256e355\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hfird28myfdf1.png?width=1089&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ec4de0e4a3fb63e164b9d3ee614e98fabd01c8\n\n* Extremely critical Russian advance here north of Myrnohrad.

This bill would hit Russia harder with sanctions than anything before, including tough secondary sanctions in the form of steep tariffs on any country that does a lot of business with Russia, particularly India and China. Potential sanctions on India are especially interesting since they are pretty close with Trump, though they are also one of the biggest external funders of Russia's war since they buy huge amounts of Russian oil. He additionally authorized the first new presidential draw down aid package for Ukraine since he's been president, allowing hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to be sent.\n* He also announced, alongside NATO head and all-around good guy Mark Rutte, that a deal is being worked out whereby European nations will buy large amounts of American war materiel to donate to Ukraine. While it's not as good as straight up aid, this will still result in a substantial amount of support for Ukraine. The first package is estimated to be worth $10 billion, which is more than any individual aid package we sent to Ukraine.\n* France and Italy, however, have both said they are opting out of this deal, as they greatly prefer to spend money on domestically produced systems. Both countries are still strong supporters of Ukraine, but they don't want to buy American arms when they could use the money to benefit their own economies, and, especially in the case of France, already produce domestic versions of most of the equipment required.\n* Germany announced that it is providing long range strike weapons to Ukraine. Whether or not these are the infamous Taurus missiles they've been waffling about sending for years now is unclear, though it seems like it might be. Long overdue if so.\n* Reporting also indicated this week that during Trump's call with Zelensky last week, he asked whether Ukraine was capable of hitting Moscow and St. Petersburg to force Russia to the negotiating table. While he later seemed to walk back this sentiment, it shows that Trump is interested in some way in hitting Putin where it hurts.\n* I've also seen an unconfirmed report that all restrictions on the use of ATACMS will be lifted, allowing Ukraine to strike anywhere in Russia within range, though I need to see more confirmation on this.\n* A high-ranking Ukrainian intelligence officer was assassinated by individuals working for Russia's FSB intelligence service in Kyiv. This was a rare success by the FSB within Ukraine. Ukraine's SBU service claimed to have killed the assassins in a gunfight several days later.\n* According to an analysis by the Economist, in the past year Russia has gained about .038 square kilometers of territory for each dead soldier. At the rate they are going, it would take 89 years for them to seize all of Ukraine. While this analysis obviously doesn't take into account the possibility of front collapses allowing Russia to move faster, it's still worth keeping in mind when you read that Russia is advancing.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,341 (+46)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,071 (+6)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,061 (+7)\n* Russian SPG losses: 957 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 339 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,347 (+55)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,217 (+7)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,419 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1016 (+12)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 597 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nAnother week of fairly light vehicle losses on both sides, though it's always a bit concerning to see Ukrainian losses be higher than Russian losses. I've also noticed that the loss rate of Ukrainian SPG systems has gone up in the past few months. They have tons of these and are able to domestically produce large numbers of them, so they can make up these losses, but it definitely seems like Russia has been able to step up its ability to target them.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading.",

Zelensky allegedly replied that such an attack would be possible if the U.S. supplied the necessary weapons.\n\n\"Volodymyr, can you hit Moscow? . . . Can you hit St Petersburg too?\" Trump said, according to the Financial Times, reportedly encouraging the strategy so that Russia can \"feel the pain\" and agree to negotiations.\n\nThe news comes as Trump seems to be warming up to Ukraine after months of a rocky relationship, offering advanced weapons to the war-torn country via a deal with NATO and threatening Russia with \"severe tariffs\" if Putin does not agree to a peace deal within 50 days.\n\nThe conversation reportedly took place during a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 4, only a day after the U.S. president talked with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFollowing the call with the Kremlin's chief, Trump complained he had made no progress toward peace and that Putin remained determined to continue his war against Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump considers authorizing Kyiv to use the 18 ATACMS missiles currently in Ukraine at their full range of 300 kilometers (about 190 miles) and supplying additional missiles.\n\nThe outlet also wrote that Trump previously considered supplying Ukraine with Tomahawk cruise missiles, weapons capable of striking Moscow and St. Petersburg, but their delivery is not on the table at the moment.\n\nAfter the July 4 call between Zelensky and Trump, Ukraine was provided a list of long-range systems it could receive via third-party countries, the Financial Times reported, citing sources.\n\nSpeaking at the White House on July 14, Trump and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Ukraine would be receiving significant military support under a new U.S.-NATO scheme, including missiles and Patriot air defenses.\n\nUkraine has previously received a number of ATACMS missiles from the Biden administration, though it was given permission to use them on Russian territory only in late 2024.

The question is, if Ukraine tells him that there are better targets to destroy, will he see that as an attack to him because Ukraine isn't listening to him?\n\nThough as much as I hate to say this, I kinda agree that some pain should be dealt to moscow. Obviously Ukraine should not attack civilians directly. That's stooping to the level of the invaders. But maybe a little inconvenience like hitting Power Plants, Water Supply system, public telecommunication facilities? IDK. Just something to inconvenience them. IF there are spare weapons, which I don't think there is. The AFU has better targets for sure. With deeper hitting weapons, that opens up jucier military targets inside ruzzia. If the weapons are really coming and will be delivered, I'm looking forward to new headlines about exploding ruzzian military facilities.",

Hopefully those features will be fixed next week.\n\nSumy last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cu0mq5xs52cf1.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a1e96ad8c60797031a132f92abd94e7225a953\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wm7noowv52cf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29c7d0114631f086b8793c5aa0fbbf25193ad2ed\n\n* Russia has pushed further in this sector both in the center and the west.\n\nKupiansk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikplfjq772cf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e21d8f3e0b98361b98b22680c7e6b7be17721b1\n\nKupiansk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sto4vhb872cf1.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc6a71b368c852b230013c78e82db36e337b66b\n\n* No changes here.\n\nLyman last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4hbdvaa72cf1.png?width=993&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b60272661c327f8211d6d896d2fa9ceec33d5d2\n\nLyman this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l9l929xa72cf1.png?width=893&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee300d84bc7c35680aa65959841b0d5379c40101\n\n* No changes here either.\n\nChasiv Yar last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4z5mv8kd72cf1.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff34a7864f1085aa19836c066ef95f803132a7b3\n\nChasiv Yar this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq4r8b2e72cf1.png?width=949&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7044626d888fc28a6cb6d0965f31c6638e0851d3\n\n* Russia advanced within the city for the first time in a while.

He said he was also trying to arrange the purchase of another Patriot battery by Ukraine. While the actions and words from his administration about Ukraine have been incredibly schizophrenic, I do think this represents a real change for Trump as he is finally realizing there is no negotiating with Putin about the war, and that he and Putin don't have a real relationship. While I wish that this whole thing would have been less pathetically predictable and transparently about Trump's ego rather than what is right, I'm still glad that the US finally seems to be moving in the right direction.\n* On that note, the sanctions bill against Russia now has very significant momentum in Congress, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune saying it could even be passed this month. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson also expressed support for the bill this week, which I don't think he had done before. When this bill gets passed (not if), it will turn Russia's already bad economic situation into a potentially catastrophic one. \n* Germany has released more details on its massive rearmament plan. They want to buy 1,000 tanks, thousands more APCs and IFVs, and large quantities of other crucial military equipment. By comparison, Germany currently has just under 300 tanks in its military, so this would triple that number. The scale of this plan is quite significant and they are clearly taking this seriously after a long time of treating their military with contempt. Merz also said he wants to finance the purchasing of more Patriot systems for Ukraine. Germany has production facilities for Patriot missiles which means it's one of the only countries outside the US that can natively sustain a Patriot capability. \n* Bloomberg reported that Russia is resorting to confiscating property from businesses in order to sustain its war effort since their oil revenues are declining so much. They have supposedly stolen almost $50 billion dollars from their own people this way. \n* Another Bloomberg report says that the EU is considering budgeting over $120 billion dollars in aid for Ukraine over the next 7 years. They are also looking at different ways they can fill the $19 billion budget gap that Ukraine is projected to have next year. \n* Russia keeps hitting Ukraine very hard with larger and larger drone and missile strikes, last night's attack was the biggest yet. Unfortunately each week sees larger attacks. Extensive damage was done in Kyiv and also in western Ukraine. \n* Ukraine is working on ways to counter this threat, however, especially with cheaply manufactured interceptor drones which can do the work of air defense missiles with a much smaller footprint and for far less money. They are rapidly scaling up production of these drones, which could be a real game changer for air defense against other drones. \n* The Economist published new estimates on casualties and deaths for Russia and Ukraine during the war. They say that since May 1 alone, 31,000 Russians have been killed. In total, they estimate between 900,000 and 1.3 million Russian casualties (killed + wounded), and 190,000 to 350,000 killed. For Ukraine, they estimate 73,000 to 140,000 total deaths in the war. These are shocking numbers. \n* Russia is allegedly planning on importing tens of thousands more North Korean troops to man their border with Ukraine, freeing up Russian troops to be sent into the country and fight on the front line. \n* Both sides have begun widespread use of drones with autonomous terminal guidance systems that allow them to attack targets on their own, limiting the ability of electronic warfare efforts to hinder them. I personally think autonomously targeted drones are an enormous threat to the human race, but I understand that in this war, you can't really take the moral high ground at the cost of your own soldier's lives. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 22,295 (+45)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,065 (+16)\n* Russian IFV losses: 6,054 (+9)\n* Russian SPG losses: 956 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 338 (+2)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 162 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 159 (+2)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,292 (+18)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,210 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,409 (+0)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 1004 (+4)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 590 (+3)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n* Ukrainian F-16 losses: 4 (+0)\n\nNot sure if Oryx simply hasn't done much updating this week or something, but these are some of the lowest vehicle loss numbers, if not the absolute lowest, I've seen in almost two years of these updates, which is quite strange considering that there is heavy combat happening all over the front. \n\nThank you for reading!",

He only respects power, and he has power, thus, he feels entitled to the same respect he's been giving Putin. The problem though, Putin comes from the soviet era, where showing any weakness, ever, means you won't be respected, and could lose that power. Trump, a business man, thinks leverage is in the negotiation, where he's used to intimidating people with his shallow world salad and financial bravado. Putin, by nature, cannot agree to or even appear to even consider negotiating with Trump, or he will lose all respect, and become a target. They're both con men, but Putin has actually given out orders to have people killed in order to show everyone else that he isn't to be crossed, while Trump has just continuously tried to cozy up to Putin in the hopes that Putin will show him \"American\" respect. He's only now figuring out that he will never get that kind of respect, and his feelings are hurt. That's it. He doesn't give a fuck about a single Ukranian and he never will, and pretty much fucking everybody knows that.",

The previous three conferences have taken place in Lugano, London, and Berlin.\n\n\"We need a Marshall Plan-style approach, and we should develop it together,\" Zelensky told representatives of governments, international organizations, and businesses who gathered in Rome.\n\nThe Marshall Plan was an economic aid program that the United States offered to European countries after World War II to help them rebuild their economies.\n\n\"Rebuilding Ukraine is not just about our country. It's also about your countries, your companies, your technology, your jobs,\" Zelensky said.\n\nDrawing comparisons to existing international coalitions supporting Kyiv's military efforts, he called upon international partners to form a recovery coalition and help Ukraine rebuild with a systematic approach.\n\n\"The way we rebuild our country can also modernize your infrastructure and industries. And I ask you to support the recovery coalition and help define specific financing mechanisms.\"\n\nZelensky stressed that Kyiv would welcome only \"true partners\" in the initiative, \"those who are not helping Russia continue this war.\"",

Zelensky is also expected to meet with U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg and Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\nThe trip comes only a day before the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, which Ukraine and Italy will co-host on July 10 and 11. Zelensky is expected to meet Kellogg on July 9, a day before the event Reuters reported.\n\nRome is hosting the fourth Recovery Conference, bringing together political and business leaders to work toward Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction amid Russia’s full-scale invasion.\n\nThe event comes as Russia intensifies aerial strikes across Ukraine and mounts ground offensives along the front line, causing destruction and putting ever greater strain on the Ukrainain economy.\n\nThe challenge is compounded by the Trump administration's growing reluctance to sustain large-scale support for the war-torn country.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on July 8 that Ukraine faces up to a $19-billion deficit next year, linked mainly to reduced U.S. support and slim prospects of a ceasefire. A senior EU official told the outlet that many of Ukraine's partners had previously counted on a peace deal in 2025, but are now forced to revise their funding plans.",

It also suggests Yermak holds an actual office to 'allow' or 'freeze', which he certainly can't, unless he speaks with the one he advises and that one does it.\n\nIn a system that shall be based on checks and balances it is totally unsurprising that investigations run, regardless against or for whom.. important is only that the process is lawful and strict following protocol and accused also acquitted if nothing turns up.\n\nIt might be rather an attempt to actually find out who requested investigations by accusing someone did so, forcing him to reject or confirm such claims.\n\nEdit: also \"Sources told the Economist that\".. sources can't tell, they are sources, you'd ask a source to receive informations, so who asked?

No country got through without deaths.\nThat being said, blame for US covid deaths should be shared amongst every administration since world war II for failing to make a system of free universal health care and for allowing the American population to become one of the most obese populations in the world.\nCompare with Denmark and Sweden. Similar systems, populations, etc. Neither country had huge excess mortality but Sweden kept the society more open than Denmark. On the short term Sweden had more deaths but in the end, they actually had done better than Denmark. Even in the beginning, when Sweden had a lot of excess mortality, it was at levels that would hvae made it the third worst influenza season in 30 years, had covid been influenza.\nThe only way to have better statistics is by first spending a month or two suppressing all knowledge of this new illness that appeared in your country, disappear doctors that talk about it and then make a big show of how you are working hard to contain it, announce that only a few regions got affected but most of the country never had any of it and then fudge statistics so it appears that you had less deaths than countries with 230 times smaller populations.",

Russian forces launched more than 550 aerial weapons, including over 330 Iranian-type Shahed drones and multiple types of missiles, including ballistic missiles, Zelensky said.",

Russia has never been a party to this convention and uses anti-personnel mines with extreme cynicism. And not just now, in its war against Ukraine – this has long been a trademark of Russian killers: to destroy life by every means available. They use chemical and ballistic weapons, including medium-range missiles, and various types of mines, including anti-personnel ones. Unfortunately, that is the reality. Of course, we see how our neighbors in Europe are reacting to this threat. We are also aware of the complexities involved in withdrawing from such a convention, especially during wartime. But we are taking this political step and sending a signal by it to all our partners – this is where attention must be focused. This concerns all countries along Russia’s borders.

Meanwhile, the participants did not approve the new 18th package of sanctions, which targeted Russia's energy and banking sectors, due to Slovakia's veto.\n\nZelensky's June 27 decree implements a decision by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council's (NSDC) to synchronize the sanctions against Russia with the EU and G7.\n\nAccording to the document, sanctions approved by partner states must be submitted to the NSDC for consideration and approval no later than the 15th day after the partner state's decision comes into force.\n\nThe Cabinet of Ministers, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), and the National Bank of Ukraine must also ensure the implementation of sanctions approved by international partners in Ukraine.\n\nAfter the 17th package of sanctions against Russia took effect on May 20, Ukraine's allies announced the following day that another round of restrictions was already in the works.\n\nThe push for tighter sanctions comes as Russia continues to reject ceasefire proposals and presses forward with military operations.",

        "body": "From the article: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara is working to organize a meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with U.S. President Donald Trump potentially joining the talks, Reuters reported.\n\nSpeaking after his meeting with Trump, Erdogan said on June 26 that the U.S. president expressed interest in participating if the meeting were to take place in Turkey.\n\n\"He said,'If Russian President Vladimir Putin comes to Istanbul or Ankara for a solution, then I will also come,'\" Erdogan told reporters. \"We will hold the necessary contacts and, God willing, realize this meeting as soon as possible.\"\n\nZelensky and Trump met during the NATO summit on June 25, where the two leaders discussed battlefield developments, Kyiv's need for additional air defense systems, and the potential for co-production of drones.\n\nZelensky has previously voiced openness to a trilateral meeting. On May 27, he told public broadcaster Suspilne that he was ready to sit down with both Trump and Putin.\n\nPutin has claimed he is also willing to meet, but did not attend previous talks proposed in Istanbul, opting instead to send lower-level delegates to peace discussions held on May 16.\n\nThe Kremlin has long sought to portray Zelensky as \"illegitimate\", with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov in February claiming that any talks must consider \"legal aspects\" of his mandate.\n\nTurkey previously hosted direct peace talks in March 2022 and has remained one of the few countries with open lines to both Kyiv and Moscow. The latest round of direct talks on June 2 was held in Istanbul.",

According to a diplomatic source cited by AFP, the talks between Zelensky and Trump were scheduled for early afternoon, with both sides finalizing the agenda.\n\nThe two leaders are expected to discuss Ukraine's planned purchase of a new defense package, including air defense systems, as well as additional sanctions on Russia and an international price cap on Russian oil.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing at The Hague on June 25, Trump was asked by a reporter what he would be discussing during the meeting with Zelensky.\n\n\"Obviously we'll be discussing his difficulties, he's got a little difficulty,\" Trump replied.\n\n\"Zelensky is a nice guy, I'm going to meet him today. I don't know, I assume we're going to be discussing Ukraine. It seems the most likely,\" he added.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on what he meant by \"difficulties\" but the NATO summit comes at a time when U.S. support for Kyiv is waning, and just a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared \"all of Ukraine is ours.\"",

He also cited the case of a deceased Israeli citizen fighting on Russia's side, whom Moscow had passed off as a Ukrainian soldier.\n\n\"Putin is afraid to admit how many people have died. Because if the moment comes when he needs to mobilize, his society will be afraid,\" he said.\n\nZelensky's remarks follow the June 2 prisoner and body exchange agreement in Istanbul, the most extensive of the full-scale war. Under that deal, Ukraine recovered 6,057 bodies of its fallen soldiers. Russia, according to Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky, took back only 78.\n\nExplaining the difference between the two numbers, Zelensky said that the bodies of the vast majority of Russian soldiers currently killed on the battlefield remain in Russian hands.\n\n\"They were advancing, and their dead remained in the territory where they were,\" he said.",

When St. javelin started, they had to scale up very quickly from a journalist who wanted to print some stickers to raise money for the Ukrainian army to a full-blown clothing manufacturer.  The initial orders were sourced from many locations and manufacturers, they were not in house, St Javelin just made the designs.  They had no control over quality etc.  think sort of ordering a lot of printed tshirts from a Website or direct manufacturers and you get what you get.  some of the early stuff was good and some not, in particular I had a few experiences with the prints coming off.  But tshirts were like $30 or $35 then, not $70 or $95. Just looked and one i ordered in 2022 was made in Haiti. \n\nSince then St Javelin has taken manufacturing in house, and in Ukraine. Quality has gone way up, and pricing has too. \n\nI in no way want to give the impression I’m slagging st javelin, I own a bunch, I hope I’ll buy more, I love it, I love wearing it,  and I respect and love the hell out of Christian for what he did.",

As Buffet used to say, \"Never bet against America\".  Under Biden, the economy grew about 2.8% a year and the economic indicators were all good.  There was a temporary rise in inflation due to the after effects of the pandemic followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Growth and moderate inflation - handled right - could have slowly reduced the debt.\n\nYet all that American voters whined about was how poor they were, how they were suffering and how much eggs cost.  People like Trump and Musk will never be the solution.  They are always part of the problem.   Because of them \"never\" has happened.   Growth for this year is projected to be at best 1.6% with inflation rising to 4% or more.   For the first time in a generation US Treasury Bonds have lost their AAA status.   Next year will be worse.  The yield is just going to get worse and worse as folks lose confidence in bat-shit crazy Uncle Sam - massively increasing the cost of servicing the debt.\n\nTrump is making all Americans poorer - with the exception of his family, his cronies and the super-rich.",

We can mobilize 27,000 people a month, while the Russians can mobilize 40,000 to 50,000 because their losses are greater. Mobilization is possible in our country because of the state of war. No one else has any experience in how to stop Putin. We were the ones who stopped him. You are right in that this is a difficult period. We did not mobilize 18- to 24-year-olds, but offered them one-year contracts. I have never spoken about this before, but since you asked, I will tell you what I think, because it is a sensitive issue: I do not believe that we should mobilize people from the age of 18, as the leaders of other countries have thought. Operation Spider Web has shown that it is not the number of people that matters, but weapons and technology. And money and exerting pressure. The sanctions would target the money that the Russians are using to finance the war. However, when it comes to sanctions, as Western partners list the reasons why they did not decide to impose them, they include that Ukraine did not mobilize people aged 18 and above.\n\n&gt;To be honest, we gave 18- to 24-year-olds the opportunity to show that they can serve if our partners want them to. We have now given them that opportunity, in accordance with our legislation. But in the meantime, thousands are fighting on the front lines without adequate weapons.  \n\n[Source](https://www.valaszonline.hu/2025/06/10/volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-war-vladimir-putin-viktor-orban-kyiv-interview/)",

I believe all (as in discounting the exception to the rule) soldier/line combatants fight for the soldier next to them and not a “greater political cause”.  Like it or not, human history is built on that fact.",

Plus, hitting a country like Russia in waves tends to be more effective than doing it all in one go. Why? Because waves create ongoing uncertainty. If you throw all your cards on the table from the start, Russia sees the full picture and can begin adapting; rerouting trade, building new trade alliances, adjusting strategy. But with staggered sanctions, they’re constantly guessing. That messes with their planning and keeps, especially their, markets jittery.\n\nThere’s also a strategic benefit for the sanctioning countries. Rolling things out step-by-step lets them monitor what’s working, plug any loopholes, and dial up the pressure when needed. It’s a more flexible and targeted approach.\n\nAnd then there's the psychological angle. A single dramatic hit makes headlines, sure, but the effect fades. Ongoing waves keep political elites on edge, drag down investor confidence, and slowly chip away at morale. With the side benefit that those dickhead CEO's who thought their companies could weather the storm for a year or two and gobble up the market share of those who left Russia immediately, are now left out to dry even worse.\n\nThat said, I do think some of the earlier waves could’ve been stronger, or at least I personally would've done so.",

The men and women that grabbed an AK and signed up in February 2022, when the russians were at the gates of Kyiv, have been fighting non stop since then. \n\nThey deserve to be demobilized after x years of service, go back to civil society, start a family, rest and heal. You cant expect people to fight for years with no end in sight except injury or death, whilst hundreds of thousands of adult men dont have to. \n\n  \nTo sum it up: \n\n* The front lines are thinly manned, allowing russians to push weak spots and make creeping advances. Giving them the idea that they're winning so they keep going. \n* Bad choices and micro management by high command lead to unnecessary casualties making the manpower situation worse (https://kyivindependent.com/azov-ex-commander-on-the-need-to-reform-ukraines-army/)  \n* Training facilities are overcrowded and are of poor quality, which also leads to higher casualties because the recruits dont know how to survive on the front.  (https://kyivindependent.com/inside-ukraines-desperate-race-to-train-more-soldiers/ \n* The mobilization proces is poorly organized leading to poor results, demotivated recruits, more draft dodgers and even attacks against draft officers (https://kyivindependent.com/attacks-on-ukraines-draft-personnel-rise-fueled-by-social-tension-and-russian-interference/) \n* Mobilized soldiers and volunteers are not demobilized and have to fight until the end of the war or until they get injured or killed.",

It is my job to hold talks on territories — and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's, who seized them. I will not discuss my position on this with anyone else,\" Zelensky said.\n\nRussia's so-called \"peace memorandum\" demands that Ukraine recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, as well as Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk oblasts — none of which are fully under Moscow's control.",

The only difference for most military airfields is that there are hardened shelters and guys with rifles who can maybe get a lucky shot on a drone or 2... maybe. Not just that, any base where theres armor in the open is vulnerable too.",

Three years ago when the war started, Ukraine had very little in the way of advanced weaponry and the Russians were bombing them with impunity. It was supposed to be over in three days.  Now, three years later we see rows of Russian bombers burning, 4000 KM from Ukraine. As an American who grew up during the Cold War, those Russian Bear bombers represented a threat and were designed to completely destroy my country. They were scary, because of both the brutish design and what they were designed to do. Seeing them burn and the one have the wing fall off, I must have watched that video 100 times already. This will go down as the turning point of the war, and it's clear to me who's going to win. It probably won't be soon, and there's a lot of fighting to do yet, but eventually Russia is going to crack. Just like the day we woke up to see all the bombers burning, one day we will wake up to an assassinated Putin, a revolution, something we weren't expecting and this is all going to be over. I will cry on that day, and they will be tears of happiness and gratitude for what Ukraine has done for the whole world. Hopefully it will represent the final death of Russian imperialism.",

It's a bit apple to oranges comparison, because Ukraine is unlikely to roll over entire russian territory, but it does show that the quantity alone goes only so far.\n\nBesides economic collapse, there's also question of non-monetary cost. Russia just lost good portion of their nuclear deterrence capabilities which at this point is becoming their only state-level defense. They are losing the ability to fight internal revolts. They'd likely be hosed in case of something like 3rd Chechen war - they only won the second war by having considerable materiel advantage - especially in air and with artillery.\n\nHow much of the aviation can they lose to effectively have none? Look at Syria to see what happens when local militia with technicals is suddenly almost on-par (technologically) with russian army.\n\nPersonally I think that russia should have pulled out of this conflict much earlier. They could get very good concessions some time ago with a bit of diplomacy. So I do expect russians dragging this war way past what's reasonable for them just by being ambitious much beyond their real capabilities. I guess they assumed they'll be flinging drones across the border for years to come, but Ukraine just showed that the conflict is going to move onto russian soil and it's not going to be just the border regions.",

It neutralized 41 “strategic aircraft” and was a brilliant technical performance.\n\nOver more than 18 months, hundreds of drones were smuggled deep into Russia. They were loaded onto civilian trucks with double-bottomed trailers, where they were concealed inside mobile boxes. The tops of those boxes—remotely controlled by operators in Ukraine but connected to the Russian telephone network—opened at the appointed time, allowing the drones to take off. All 41 targets were carefully studied for months by Ukrainian intelligence, and they exploded simultaneously without civilian casualties.\n\nThis is the Ukrainian equivalent of the September 2024 pager attack in which Israel annihilated nearly all of Hezbollah’s active forces. It is one of those operations of crazy audacity and unparalleled ingenuity that make military history. It will be taught for ages in war schools.\n\nThis achievement was a slap in the face to Russia—and not the first. At the beginning of the war, there was the Moskva cruiser, the flagship of its fleet, sunk off Odesa by two Ukrainian-made missiles. Then, the double strike on the Kerch Bridge, [Vladimir Putin](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin)’s pride, the jewel of his cardboard crown and a symbol of the continuity he believed he was establishing between Crimea and Russia. Last year, half of Mr. Putin’s fleet in the Black Sea was destroyed. The other half retreated pitifully to Novorossiysk or the Sea of Azov. Also in 2024, Ukraine staged an offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.\n\nSigmund Freud spoke of the three humiliations on Western man—inflicted by Copernicus, Darwin and Freud himself. If Volodymyr Zelensky had the heart to laugh, he could speak of the five humiliations he has inflicted on that enemy of the West: Russia. Mr. Putin and his people stand exposed as braggarts, paper tigers. Ukraine is David to the Goliath of Russia, nearly 30 times its size.",

For another film, the drone battalions of Lyman and Kupiansk closed the sky in place of their overly timid allies. This winter, in Pokrovsk and Sumy, high-tech command rooms where battles were fought at a distance. I even heard—at the time without fully understanding—Mr. Zelensky announcing that his engineers were developing a new generation of drones capable of striking Russia up to the Arctic.\n\nToday, all the cards are turned. Mr. Putin terrorized the world with his nuclear blackmail. There was an army capable of calling his bluff—and it did.\n\n“Just say thank you,” Vice President [JD Vance](https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/jd-vance) lectured President Zelensky during their February altercation in the Oval Office. All of us should thank Ukraine, a small nation that has grounded a third of the bombers that promised apocalypse to Warsaw, Berlin or Paris.\n\nThis weekend’s drone operation is a further step on the path to victory. I don’t know what form that victory will take, or whether it will be the front, the rear or its regime that will give in first in Russia. But the balance of power is increasingly clear.\n\nOn one side, a ridiculed general staff, an ultimate weapon that is greatly diminished and discredited, troops so demoralized that they fight only with the support of North Korean, Chinese, Ghanaian, Bangladeshi and Iranian mercenaries.\n\nOn the other side, a patriotic citizen army, motivated and knowing why it combats—an army that has proved its mastery of the most advanced military technologies, its excellence not only in trench warfare but also in the new remote and ghost warfare.\n\nUkraine will defeat Russia on the battlefield or impose the terms of a just peace. Either way it will win the war.\n\n*Mr. Lévy is author of “Israel Alone” and director of the Ukraine documentary “Our War,” forthcoming June 11.

In the Donetsk Region Shell had a 50-year profit sharing deal with the government of Ukraine to explore and drill for natural gas in shale rock formations.\n\n&gt;US energy giant Chevron also signed a similar deal for $10 billion, but it was focusing on developing shale gas reserves in the West of Ukraine. However, one year into the Russia-backed conflict, both decided to freeze or postpone their shale-exploring activities in Ukraine. Probably also driven by the low gas prices, the profit-oriented energy giants simply shied away from their shale projects in the conflict-ridden country, citing the lack of security for their investments and worsening extraction prospects as their main reasons.\n\n&gt;According to Unconventional Gas Information Project expert Mykola Shlapak, it was indeed the fighting that scared Shell away from the Yuzivska project. “In the geographical sense there are two major regions with unconventional gas production potential. One of them is located in the east of Ukraine and is partially on the territories currently not controlled by the Ukrainian government, where the armed conflict is taking place.\n\nWhat's the reason to believe they'd work now? With constant declarations of non-intervention and openly voiced fears of helping Ukraine too much resulting in WW3?",

This is by far the most dangerous area of the front right now, and it's not good that Ukraine seems to be having a lot of trouble with containing Russian advances here.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suvxd1aldq3f1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8cb63ca4458ab1e13bdb6f334f96b4488ca25be\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk4k1nyldq3f1.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48923114cff7f1f97be706a85342002e91edd384\n\n* Russian troops advanced again north and west of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump made several disparaging posts about Putin on Truth Social, including making a barely veiled threat that things would be much worse for Russia if it wasn't for him (not exactly the brag that he might think it is). He did also needlessly criticize Zelensky again in one of these posts and said he would give Putin another two weeks to come to the table with a real deal before he starts pursuing sanctions. It is beyond pathetic that he keeps making these strong statements only to follow them up with more appeasement and lack of real pressure, but I do think that at some point he will fully realize that Putin has been playing him this whole time.\n* Russia, meanwhile, is \"negotiating\" by hitting Ukraine with bigger and bigger drone and missile strikes each week, killing civilians and making peace more difficult.\n* Ukraine is, however, able to respond with large, damaging drone strikes of their own, including a direct hit on a factory that makes cruise missile components a few days ago. Ukraine's long range drone strike capability keeps getting better and better, and I do think that at some point in the next few months it will reach a tipping point where they have degraded Russian air defense stockpiles enough that they will be able to really do significant damage to the Russian war effort with these strikes.\n* Ukrainian reports have indicated that Russia continues to produce more and more strike drones, and they may soon be able to launch 500 per day, which would be very difficult for Ukraine to counter.\n* German Chancellor Merz announced that in consultation with the other Western allies, all restrictions on range for the use of Western weapons in Ukraine have been lifted. This could soon be followed up by an announcement that Germany is delivering Taurus missiles to Ukraine (though this could also happen without an announcement). Germany also said they were beginning their process of greatly stepping up military aid to Ukraine, including a large multi-billion-dollar package that is being sent right now.\n* One report I saw this week claims that Russia has been able to modify its Iskander ballistic missiles to make them harder to target, both by allowing them to make course modifications in flight and using radar decoys that the missile is able to launch itself. We've seen some more successful Iskander strikes in the last few weeks including one on Ukrainian troops training in the open (which should never have been allowed to happen), and these modifications might play a big part in that. In war, if you're not constantly improving your stuff, you're losing, and that idea is not lost on either the Russians or the Ukrainians.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,968 (+163)\n* Russian tank losses: 4,029 (+42)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,997 (+37)\n* Russian SPG losses: 942 (+6)\n* Russian SAM losses: 332 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 141 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+1)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 9,017 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,194 (+10)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,376 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 949 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 561 (+5)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nA bit of a return to the mean today, with Russian losses spiking heavily due to their offensive, including one of the highest weekly tank losses I've seen since I started this project. Ukrainian losses are still relatively high but are now dwarfed by Russian ones.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading and for your support!

It's insane they think they can take a major city back like Kherson. \nIt's sad that 1-2 losses aren't sustainable for Ukraine as those are impressive given they have to rely on a smaller economy. The upside is that Ukraine lost primarily cheaper IMV's that can be made from civilian donations while Russia primarily lost expensive vehicles. \n\n\nPay attention what leaders do not what they say- Trump is just leading everyone on.  The assumed position should be that he doesn't want to do sanctions and that threats should be ignored. Hopefully Europe picks up some slack. The TACO comments might help here. ",

        "body": "Well... **no, not necessarily** (in spite of the numerous simplistic comments here about \"target-rich environment\"). I'll try to explain briefly for those interested:\n\nRussia has done a shitload of stupid things this war, but even they learn slowly. So \"50,000 troops\" (this is just some number cited by Zelensky; it could be completely off, deliberately or not. There could be no offensive coming at all, or in a different location. Take it with a grain of salt) are not going to be standing bunched up in one open field or driving in a giant exposed convoy along a single highway like during the initial invasion (never mind that the scale of that doesn't work out... 50,000 is a lot of people). That's not what 'massing' automatically means. Instead any operation of such a size will be conducted along **several dozen km** of frontline, with **significant depth** as well, and troops held further back in reserve.\n\nFormations marked for the offensive may not be present in the trenches on the actual frontline at all until it starts in earnest, instead building up in the rear. Troops will typically be **dispersed** along a wide area, conceal their positions, place decoys, and dig some **trenches** at minimum, because you don't want to give your opponent an opportunity to take out thousands of soldiers with a single missile. That dispersion works against the concentration that is needed to breakthrough during the offensive itself, but it is necessary to make the survive in an age of very deadly precision weapons. \n\nThe combination of *dispersion, concealment, and cover* on both sides makes it so that neither Ukraine, nor Russia can afford to use missile strikes on every single bit of trench that may have some grunts in it. There simply aren't enough munitions for that. The actual decision-making on what targets *are* worth spending what munitions on, are very freaking complicated and would take more than a few paragraphs to explain properly, so let me instead put it like this:\n\nThere's *always* 50,000 troops in another two dozen more places along the front, there's *always* hundreds of potentially very juicy targets for Ukraine to strike like nearly irreplaceable enablers/weapon systems/aircraft/infrastructure, and there's *never* enough unguided artillery shells period. Let alone enough precision weapons to wipe out a fraction of the (quite replaceable) 50,000 mobiks massing in \"some region\" that may be &gt;&gt;1000 km^2 big.",

'Sacrifice' is not a good thing in this context. \n\nThe reason why Ukraine is taking so much casualties is because a large chunk of world is 'standing by Ukraine' instead of acting with it. More weapons we send, the more Russians can Ukraine kill, that's all that matters.\n\n(sorry for the rant below, you can stop reading, but I need to get this out)\n\nI am not from Ukraine (as many on this subreddit), but the common outside perspective mentality, seems to be that \"oh wars are won by sacrifice, but we are helping\". \n\nHelp with what? We didn't send arms when they were most needed, now Ukraine is running out of men. And now we are just talking how Ukraine should make sacrifices? Fuck off with that bullshit. This shit was entirely preventable, yet people take it as something inevitable, but you know, \"we won WWII anyway because we were the good guys, no biggie\".\n\nIt's fucking infuriating, especially because Ukraine is forced to make that 'sacrifice' due to collective inaction of the western countries.\n\nRant over.",

Seeing the images of the full bases side by side with empty ones is quite eerie.\n\n**Maps:**\n\nSumy last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mylwmei7hc2f1.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91f7915c60161717a8ffccce6d8d250aa9a60b05\n\nSumy this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l34kr7r8hc2f1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaec3dcf3a528d71f9c73795d72072b0e80f6950\n\n* No changes here.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrsby2bchc2f1.png?width=799&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3673cfbb01ebc05f551872589479b19999d9d9a2\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqk1zltdhc2f1.png?width=827&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d705bb8b361d9460eca868c2b16d091a61d3f30\n\n* No changes here either.\n\nLyman last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w1h5zyghc2f1.png?width=834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d08d9929404c0833f5a696a4aea1b466a6d64173\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/308pm42ihc2f1.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c184bee27d6e3a65d328af3b5bd7ede1683c72a\n\n* Russian forces advanced north of Lyman, and expanded the grey zone east of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q34gbh8rhc2f1.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cf6310c992fb4011649d2e3d9e20c5efcc75dfa\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07vb2oeshc2f1.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb1fdd8fad1ac015fa370028ac668d84cfdd1fd\n\n* No changes here.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkrgt55vhc2f1.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bea10b14fcbcc52cd6313ebbbd9ba783d1deae7\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ef2lzcwhc2f1.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fca3dff338182cd7950b8b90a2b6453b0f21ffdf\n\n* Russian troops greatly expanded their salient east of Pokrovsk, though it seems a Ukrainian counterattack was able to retake some ground. Pokrovsk is now threatened with encirclement, and the defense of Toretsk may also be put in jeopardy by these advances. Things are very precarious in this area at the moment, and Ukraine needs to send in some reserves to stabilize the situation ASAP.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vfo5rddic2f1.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80edfecda45ccd4cefba79f45a600f32d356070b\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7a6rorpeic2f1.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e921cf9799e30f0f7797871720c464107e6ce83e\n\n* Russia advanced north of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this week:**\n\n* Trump had a two-hour conversation on the phone with Putin this week. He spoke with the leaders of several European nations and Zelensky immediately afterwards, where he shocked them all by saying that Putin was now ready to begin negotiations even though Ukrainian and Russian diplomats had already met in Turkey last week to start those discussions. He also repeated baseless statements that Russia is winning the war, and, according to the Washington Post, privately told officials that Putin actually has no interest in coming to the table. It is totally unclear what Trump is actually pursuing, or who's side he is on, and the common adage about him that he parrots whatever the last person he spoke to said to him seems to be holding true here. But if there's one thing that has become abundantly clear, it's that Trump's entire negotiating \"strategy\" if you can even say there has been one, has been a complete failure and has made him look like even more of an idiot than he already did.\n* In a show of how little Russia cares about Trump's peace overtures, they launched their largest drone strike ever against Ukraine the night of May 17th, killing civilians and causing damage all over the country even though many of the drones were shot down.\n* In response, Ukraine launched what some reports have said is their largest drone attack against Russia ever, with hundreds of drones shutting down the Moscow airport and hitting oil refineries in Ryazan. One thing I do wonder is to what extent these mass attacks are causing attrition to Russian stocks of air defense missiles. Their stocks are obviously very deep, but you can only shoot down hundreds of drones a week for so long. I haven't seen any indications yet that they are having trouble supplying their AD units, but it's something I'm watching for, especially as Ukraine continues to produce more and more drones.\n* Pro-Ukraine candidate Nicosur Dan won the presidential election in Romania against the pro-Russia and anti-Europe candidate George Simeon. This is a big win for Ukraine as Romania is a very important base for incoming aid and is one of the only EU countries that shares a border with Ukraine. The Romanian parliament then also passed a bill allowing their military to shoot down Russian drones that enter their airspace.\n* New polling from Harvard/Harris shows that a solid majority, 62%, of Americans support continued military aid deliveries to Ukraine.\n* EU nations agreed in principle to a $170 billion dollar fund to finance European defense. The money will be raised by EU level borrowing and then loaned to countries (including Ukraine) for the purposes of strengthening their national defense and arms industries. This is a lot of money, and if it's spent wisely could have a significant effect.\n* Meanwhile Denmark, which is easily one of the strongest supporters of Ukraine in Europe, announced another big aid package for Ukraine, worth $600 million dollars, containing self-propelled guns, artillery ammunition, and parts for F-16s, all very important contributions.\n* Some of the 49 Australian M1 Abrams tanks promised by that country are already in Ukraine, while the rest are on their way. This is more tanks than the US gave when it sent Abrams, though the Abrams has not exactly been a game changer, and the logistical problems it comes with are significant. But more relatively modern Western tanks are still desperately needed, so this shipment is very welcome.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,805 (+48)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,987 (+4)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,960 (+24)\n* Russian SPG losses: 936 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 331 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 141 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,940 (+67)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,184 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,372 (+4)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 932 (+17)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 556 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nRelatively light losses on both sides this week, though it's never good to see the Russians have fewer losses than the Ukrainians. I expect numbers on both sides, and particularly for the Russians, to rise greatly next week as the Russians launch more attacks.",

China is already waiting to invade Taiwan, and are slowly stepping up support for the Russians. They don't want to see Russia lose the war, and open European involvement could easily push them to both step up their military and financial support for Russia and accelerate their timeline for invading Taiwan, which would potentially trigger a US response, and there you go, World War 3. \n\nAlso, European nations directly fighting on the front lines in Ukraine would mean Russia would have the right to attack European military bases with missiles. Then one of those countries triggers NATO article 5, and there you go, World War 3 again.\n\nI understand that doesn't feel fair to you. And you're right, it's not fair. But life isn't fair, and geopolitics certainly isn't fair. Unfortunately sometimes you have to play the game with a weak hand so that you don't trigger cascading cycles of violence that could easily lead to global thermonuclear war.",

The war technically ended right there with a DMZ similar to what the Koreas have, and it was written off as a job well done.\n\n The North waited two years after the U.S. left and made re-entry into the war illegal before they attacked the South again and the ARVN simply folded in half with little effort.\n\n Funny enough the reason the battle of Saigon took as long as it did is because when Operation Whirlwind was happening the NVA was in full hysterics because all they saw were waves of U.S. military helicopters over the city going back and forth and they thought a full fresh wave of U.S. ground forces were being redeployed rapidly and they knew they didn't have the manpower or resource to take on a freshly rested American military. \n\n As the evacuation operation finished up and the NVA pushed in, Northern and Southern forces were actually walking up to each other with terms of surrender which caused mass confusion. \n\n In the end Vietnam realized they were on the wrong side when their communist brothers in China invaded them next and they watched as U.S. backed South Korea and Japan exploded into world leaders both in technology and economy with the full protection of the U.S. military. It's kind of why they're now requesting the U.S. navy to port at their docks and sell them weapons to deter Chinese aggression. \n\n People like to bring up the Vietnam War a lot to mock the U.S. military when the entire conflict was a full master class of pure military domination.

Motivation matters in war, where soldiers are expected to make the largest sacrifice. Nationalists fighting with backs to the wall against imperialists have a very clear war aim. They usually have higher motivation and staying power, especially in the modern age of mass media and self-determination expectations. Historically, if I was betting on this sad war, odds say Ukraine can outlast one old tyrant. If Russia’s conscripts refuse to die in Ukraine, Russia loses.

Time in control, time alive, time to keep playing things along to see if something breaks his way unexpectedly, time to delay the Russian people realizing just how horrifically he has fucked them and thus avoiding them rising up to murder him just like the Libyans did to Qaddafi, who died like a dog in a ditch. He has pushed things so far that there simply is no graceful way to back down with inviting unrest and regime instability.\n\nFundamentally, Putin is holding out because he thinks he can get a better deal entering peace negotiations at some point in the future (or never) than he can get right now. The costs to him of peace include increased regime insecurity. The benefits of the peace are limited to a fraction of what he hoped to achieve in Ukraine and represent a crushing humiliation for Russia compared to the expectations for their military performance pre-2022. The costs of continuing war are just more dead, ordinary poor Russians that Putin doesn't care about. The benefits include opportunities to seize more land and resources while further destabilizing the western political order that Putin so deeply fears and despises. He also maintains wartime control over the Russian people, including extraordinary powers over propaganda and internal security that represent dramatically curtailed civil rights for ordinary Russians compared to the much greater freedoms they enjoyed a mere 15 years ago, or even just before the full scale invasion, after which the Russian security services started tightening the screws on dissent aggressively. Also, the more soldiers that die on the front, the fewer veterans the Russian state will have to pay to rehabilitate, and the fewer potential disaffected Decemberist-style revolutionaries to threaten his regime. \n\nAnd right at this particular moment, the US negotiating strategy is remarkably stupid, in that it not only does not remove Putin's incentive to hold out, rather it actually enhances that incentive greatly. Trump has presented Putin with a win-win situation if he delays negotiating longer. Either he receives further concessions from Trump as Trump desperately struggles to bribe Putin to agree to a ceasefire, or Trump gets angry and washes his hands of the situation, leaving Ukraine and Europe at large with substantially reduced American security support and involvement. Either result would be an enormous victory for Putin.\n\nPutin would **love**--and in fact **is loving**--to see the US withdraw from participating in European security by rhetorically and financially backing away from its support for Ukraine and for NATO, while drawing down the US troop presence on the continent. He sees the western order fracturing, with Europe too weak to stand up for itself and America too broken and stupid to protect the world order it created and which has ensured its geopolitical hegemony for decades. Why negotiate with an opponent who is in the middle of a self-destructing? If holding out only either increases the likelihood of the US abandoning Ukraine and Europe or of Russia receiving inordinate concessions from Trump, there's absolutely no reason for Putin to settle now, and plenty of reason to want to delay.",

In different subreddits, youtube and comment fields in other fora, there is a shift to a \"russia is winning, this needs to end\" view, which is conveniently the common russian talking points. My question is, why do you guys think this message is gaining traction? It is not _just_ bots.\n\nThe way I see it is, yes, the US is a huge disappointment, but the combination of increased domestic production of weapons in Ukraine, the increase in production and donation from European countries, and the mostly European funded projects like the Czech ammunition initiative makes this mostly a moot point. The gap is anti air ammunition, and primarily Patriot missiles. At the same time that the influx of arms seems to actually significantly increase, russia is showing signs of actually in practice having run out of readily fixable equipment from soviet storage. Explaining the massive numbers in \"vehicles\" lost compared to tanks/IFVs/APCs. Ukraine has a formidable experience and drone army, and the current attempts at armored breakthroughs have been thoroughly smashed. The russian loss rates for each square meter gained has been steadily rising. Ukraine is heading towards artillery parity in available ammunition, and russia has never managed to make any significant captures without massive artillery dominance. So I, as a first rate armchair general, don't see any other outcome of the famed \"russian summer offensive\" than a failure, and a final culmination of the russian offensive actions. As long as Ukraine holds on, and support continues, the situation for russia will only get worse.\n\nSo why is the russian propaganda so effective?",

This comparatively humane treatment was a thorn in the side of the German Nazis:   \n*\"Unlike Jews in other Axis-aligned countries, no Jews in Italy or Italian-occupied areas were murdered or deported to concentration camps in Germany before September 1943. In the territories occupied by the Italian Army in Greece, France and Yugoslavia, Jews even found protection from persecution. The Italian Army actively protected Jews in occupation zones, to the frustration of Nazi Germany, and to the point where the Italian sector in Croatia was referred to as the \"Promised Land\".*   \n*Up to September 1943, Germany made no serious attempt to force Mussolini and Fascist Italy into handing over Italian Jews. It was nevertheless irritated with the Italian refusal to arrest and deport its Jewish population, feeling it encouraged other countries allied with the Axis powers to refuse as well.\"* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Holocaust\\_in\\_Italy)\n\nVance, on the other hand, could certainly use a concrete demonstration of the consequences of russian cruelty against the Ukrainian civilian population—but he doesn't even listen to his cousin, who fought on the front lines for Ukraine...",

Trump's a complete moron who has no idea what he's doing, Vance knows damn well what he's doing but doesn't *care*. I doubt Vance even personally agrees with anything he advocates for, I doubt he disagrees with those things either. He does whatever gets him the most power, being Trump's running mate and now VP fits his MO. \n\nWould anyone expect an obese octogenarian with apparent dementia and a diet consisting of McDonalds to even *survive* until 2028? If I were as nihilistic as Vance and given the choice between running for president myself and piggybacking off the guy waddling into his own grave who has what amounts to a cult supporting him, I'd go with the latter. It's the most efficient path to the Oval Office. I first had this hunch back during the campaign when Vance spread those rumours about the Haitian migrants eating animals. He pretty much said that he didn't believe it was happening so much as others would believe it. There were two outcomes either some dumbasses would believe him or it would sink Trump's campaign and Vance would benefit from both outcomes. Words mean nothing to him, they are simply *means* in and of themselves.",

At the end Vance gets to say \"well, the VP has to fall in line, so what could I do?\" All the while he's been actively trying to accelerate Trump's mental demise by feeding him bullshit, pulling bullshit himself (Vance knows damn well why Zelenskyy doesn't wear a suit, he's heard Zelenskyy say thank you to the American people *in front of Congress*), and letting the president surround himself with a bunch of whackos. Like, with the Greenland visit Vance *never* said he actually agreed with Trump's desire to annex the island, it was \"well my boss wants it so I guess we're doing it then.\" If you pay close attention to how Vance has been speaking, he's always phrasing things along those lines. \"Well, the president says \\[incoherent bullshit goes here\\].\"\n\nVance is the antithesis to Pence. While I don't like Pence that much and disagree with Pence on... well *everything*, he eventually realized that his President was insane and formed this impromptu coalition of adults with Barr and Esper... way too late but they did manage to make sure power was transferred to the Biden administration. The irony here being that Trump's erratic behaviour produced the \"Deep State\" he's paranoid about. Vance would have overturned the election just to make Trump look like a mad dictator. Really, because of how absolutely deranged Trump is it's impossible for him to distinguish between yes men and saboteurs *posing* as yes men. The Vice President is there to say \"no this is a stupid idea\" but Vance wants Trump to follow his stupid ideas to their logical conclusions. The dumber the President's ideas get, the more they harm the world, the better it is for Vance. For example, with Ukraine and NATO, Vance will pull a 180 the moment he gets behind the Resolute Desk and people are going to eat it up like you say.\n\nIn functionality, it's not all that different from how Putin took power after Yeltsin's incompetency, how Stalin managed to maneuver himself into succeeding Lenin. If you have the ambition, you can weasel your way to the top. Of course, I wouldn't say that Vance is like Putin or Stalin, he's more like the Millennial Richard Nixon. Like Nixon, Vance has no ideology beyond attaining power and like Nixon he's a cunning type. Hell, he's probably smarter than Nixon since Nixon managed to be VP for someone who served two terms and didn't reach the oval office for another two terms after that. Vance might not even need to *run* in a primary if he can get Trump slapped with the 25th.\n\nGoing into 2028 you could have an incumbent 44-year-old Vance, which is *insane.* Depending on how fast the administration implodes, he could become the youngest president ever, at most he'd be only the third youngest. Again, that's *way* easier than if he had run in 2024 himself.",

        "body": "Everyone is voting you up, but the history of the Church's influence in the region is actually kinda the EXACT OPPOSITE of what you are implying! \n\n------------------------------------\n\nEssentially: \n\nThe \"Vatican\" actually had far far more wealth and land area back a millennium ago, and into the middle ages--in which there were multiple land-regions throughout Italy that were deemed \"Independent Kingdoms\" and territory ruled over by the Pope and Catholic church, just exactly as the Vatican territory is ruled today. \n\nAnd for the most part, other forces back then respected those kingdom borders, and didn't generally tend to cross over the lines and invade. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nAlso very interesting side note: \n\nOne of those regions has an insanely huge sized religious-palace, that probably rivals the Vatican in design and ornate artistry! \n\nIn fact many movies are filmed there, including the recent \"Conclave\" movie, in which that palace was used/portrayed as the interior of the current Vatican! So if you watched that recent movie and thought, \"Ok, they must have filmed this in the real Vatican?!\" Nope: they filmed in just one of the former territory palaces. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlso keep in mind: this was a decision that the people going back about a millennium ago decided to make for themselves. \n\nLarge numbers of people in the region of Italy just wanted to gravitate/convert to the Catholic church, and wanted the Pope and the Church to be their head of state, and they wanted to build huge religious palaces and churches in the region, and decorate those palaces/churches with works of art that are highly valuable today. \n\nRight or wrong, that's simply just what the citizens of that Catholic nation/region wanted to do! \n\nIt was their kingdom/nation/borders. So that's what they did within their own borders. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBUT THEN... \n\nOutside and adjacent forces began invading/eroding that wealth and land, seizing it and holding it, and taking it away. \n\nAnd the reason they were able to take away alot of that territory is because the Church ruled kingdom often wanted to avoid war and killing, in those areas at least. They had some rather strong religious beliefs that tried to prioritize peace over war, but enemies took advantage of that in those regions. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo this continued, and even got worse after WWII, so that today: \n\nOnly the Vatican remains! \n\nIt's the LAST STANDING REFUGE of this centuries old nation. \n\nThe Vatican is the last standing fortress against the regional forces that eroded the Catholic ruled nation over the last multiple centuries, in which the possessions/art/wealth of many of those regions were taken further and further back as they retreated. \n\nAnd so you see: That's why I think you got it backwards a bit! \n\n--------------------------------\n\nNow, that said... \n\nIf you're just trying to imply that the Vatican did some very bad things in the last few centuries, then I would agree with you! \n\nSadly, the Vatican did some horrible unspeakable stuff to aboriginal people around the World, as well as horrific stuff to orphaned children. (I don't even want to tell you how bad that was--I've read a lot of details and it left me feeling depressed for months, that's how bad it was--but I think you probably already know some of it.) \n\nAnyways, in a positive hopeful sign: Pope John Paul first began apologizing for that to the aboriginal people, and visited them... \n\nAnd then the last Pope repeated the apologies. And hopefully this Pope does as well. \n\nBut ya... I guess... Apologies/talk is cheap. Damage was done. \n\nAnyways... History is complex... And often depressing.",

This despite the fact that Sybiha (Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs) was already in Ankara, but since there's no Putin the only thing worth discussing with a low-level delegation is a ceasefire, and they won't get Ukraine's MFA either.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Putin clearly snubbed the high-level US delegation. When asked about it, Trump had this take:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1knh21n/video/gsesw2g3yz0f1/player\n\nRelatable translation:  \n\\- Jennifer do you want to go to the dance?  \n\\- No, go away  \n\\- I wasn't even planning on going to the dance.

Perhaps that longevity has convinced hardliners who doubted he could keep up the fight. He has also never stopped visiting hospitals, schools and the front, which increases his reach over time, further increasing trust among a higher number of people.\n\nAnd while it's easy to see how he appeals to those who want to win this war, he might nowadays also appeal to those who would accept peace and a degree of territory loss, because he has shown to be willing to be much more eager than Putin to enter in negotiations.\n\nAnd there are those who might value his diplomatic skills in how he so far managed world class weirdo Trump.\n\nAlso remember that it's just a poll. We always have to be careful with rating poll results highly. You read a poll not by rating the exact numbers, but by identifying trends.

Those can change depending on what benefits his ego, but self-aggrandizement is a constant with him. His narcissism is the one thing that never takes a step back. In a manner very characteristic of narcissists, he seems to have some unhealthy obsession with Putin, he sees him as a bro and a role model. Of course, they also align ideologically, but that can become secondary if he perceives some slight or betrayal from Putin. Narcissists can often do a complete 180 on someone they're obsessed with. I wouldn't bet on it though because Trump is genuinely very dumb and easy to manipulate. Putin could spit in his face and then immediately appeal to his vanity and promise him a statue or a hotel in Moscow and Trump would eat it up.",

Biden should've been giving them more weapons and giving enough for Ukraine to drive those scumbags back to orcland. But at least Biden was giving weapons, trump is subservient to putin and is the most corrupt president in us history. When trump gets on his knees for Putin, it shows weakness and they see that as an invitation to attack more. They are playing with a different rulebook and If you understood how dictators operate, you'd know Putin will never stop until we get some balls and give a 24 hour window and if they're not out of Ukraine, use overwhelming air support to crush his military in occupied Ukraine. Putin fears for his life, if he cares about living, which he clearly does, he knows that we'd turn Russia into a glass parking lot and he'd be dead. It is pure sabre rattling",

The guy’s truth social account posts looks like the writings on the walls inside a mental asylum. He does not respect anyone, goes golfing instead of attending fallen soldiers funerals. I’m losing hope that you guys will ever take a step back and look at the man you’re praising. He just wants the Nobel peace prize so he can brag on himself, the guy is 100% malignant narcissist with zero empathy for other human beings suffering. Zelensky showed trump pictures of the soldiers returned home from being POW’s and looking like holocaust survivors, pictures of the slaughtering of civilians and trump did not give a shit at all, the blank look on his face tells you everything you need to know",

We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire — complete, lasting and reliable — starting tomorrow, May 12, and Ukraine is ready to meet.”\n\nAndriy Yermak, Zelensky’s chief of staff, said on Telegram that first there had to be a ceasefire, “then everything else”.\n\nHowever, Putin has so far refused to bow to pressure from the US, UK and Europe to accept a 30-day ceasefire. During his latest comments, he suggested holding a new round of negotiations on May 15 in Istanbul but added there would be no preconditions on Russia’s part",

    "selftext": "Hope everyone reading this is doing well today!\n\n**Video of the Week:** \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1khrum1/video/o3wfblm6ekze1/player\n\n* This video, taken by a Ukrainian naval drone, shows a Russian Su-30 multirole fighter being shot down over the Black Sea by an American supplied Aim-9 missile launched by the drone recording the video, or possibly a different drone. Ukrainian leadership claimed that they shot down another Russian plane at practically the same time, in the same way. This is the first time in history an unmanned vehicle has shot down a fighter jet. The fact that they apparently destroyed two means they must have really caught the Russians with their pants down. \n\n**Maps:** \n\nSumy last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luso94n1fkze1.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc3b14bc8886c566fa34578530dcd00e6887635b\n\nSumy this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41y69vx2fkze1.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c38eb3125c4e62b3eef9cc2f3eb55b1227b208\n\n* No advances by Russian forces here this week. I've seen some reports that Ukrainians made another advance into Kursk here, but it's not on the map, so isn't confirmed. \n\nKupiansk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6087fdbcfkze1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e38af01c199f11a203b89f6da0b0c30bdb55fca7\n\nKupiansk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vhdh8ksdfkze1.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97367bde91089da423483739df8ba045731186c9\n\n* No changes here. \n\nLyman last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhuno2ogfkze1.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d421f31c7a7d00328fe3b41d201a161ae29cb43\n\nLyman this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y195j49ifkze1.png?width=918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be383d0f4c42f028102f537338f7987c906f2f66\n\n* Russian forces made very small advances north of Siversk and northeast of Lyman.\n\nChasiv Yar last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5gopgisfkze1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95c29b437d3540ed8aba70f22660ebd2919752a\n\nChasiv Yar this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o203r73ufkze1.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d94465c9232ce2aa9cffaafeba6cd9e4f260f0c\n\n* Russia took a reasonably substantial chunk of territory north of Chasiv Yar this week. Remember that this screenshot is more zoomed in than the others, so this looks bigger than it is. Still, it's the first change we've seen here in a while. Fortunately the advance was not actually within the city, so it's unclear if this represents any kind of real change in the status quo here. \n\nPokrovsk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keqfv4r5gkze1.png?width=1046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d305c56aecb792552952b69ef098e12127713a7\n\nPokrovsk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s62sns07gkze1.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14cb26e4d6be12e0f2b7a7f805dc2214a345645a\n\n* Russia advanced southwest of Pokrovsk and also made a major breakthrough of Ukrainian lines between Pokrovsk and Toretsk. This is the first breakthrough we've seen here in a while. Strong Ukrainian units have been sent to contain the advance, but if it gets much further it could seriously imperil the fight for Toretsk. Russia has been pushing very hard here for quite some time, so it's not unexpected that they would finally see some success, but still, it's not good that this happened. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbnkk1ppgkze1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a13888d76b80aa7368430c8db89b892c9f70582\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gve9gr5rgkze1.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658ab3189f85faf22a01729a97f24677f8cabeef\n\n* Russia took a chunk of territory west of Velyka Novosilka, no changes here besides that. \n\n**Events this week:** \n\n* A wave of hundreds of Ukrainian drones hit targets all over Russia yesterday, shutting down the Moscow airport right before the Russian Victory Day parade, which is scheduled to take place tomorrow. Military airfields near Moscow were also hit, as were key industrial sites including the biggest producer of fiber optic cable in Russia, which sustained a direct hit and major damage. Drones using fiber optic cables have become crucially important all over the front, so hitting the factory that produces the cables is very clever. \n* Russia responded with their own wave of drone and missile strikes against Ukraine, killing civilians in several different places. Ukrainian air defense is being stretched to the limit at the moment, though they are set to receive more Patriot batteries soon, and hopefully enough interceptor missiles to allow them to engage more targets. \n* Probably due to fear of Ukrainian strikes at the parade itself, several world leaders who were set to attend have dropped out, including the president of Azerbaijan, which has fairly close ties with Russia. \n* The Trump administration has shown even more frustration with Putin and Russia, with Trump saying Putin wants \"all of Ukraine,\" and JD Vance saying that \"the Russians are demanding too much.\" Russia did have a real chance to play the Trump administration and get a relatively favorable peace deal out of them, but they are too rigid and beholden to their maximalist war goals to take advantage of that opportunity, and now I do think they've missed their chance. \n* Reuters is also reporting that the cut off of US aid to Ukraine that happened after the Oval Office fight between Trump and Zelensky was not ordered by Trump. Apparently Defense Secretary and known idiot Pete Hegseth ordered it on his own, before being overruled a week later. Hegseth has got to go, and this is just the latest reason why. \n* Staunchly pro-Ukraine German leader Friedrick Merz was officially inaugurated as Chancellor, after unexpectedly losing the first vote. He is keeping on Boris Pistorious as defense minister, who is one of the biggest champions of Ukraine in Europe. I expect that German military support for Ukraine will grow dramatically in the next year.\n* Czech leader and extremely strong Ukraine supporter Petr Pavel announced that the Czech initiative to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine has grown even further, with potentially up to 1.8 million total shells being delivered by the end of this year, an increase of 300,000 over what was planned before. This initiative has been hugely successful and is one of the biggest reasons why Ukrainian artillery has been much closer to parity with the Russians so far this year.  \n* French news reported that the production of the highly capable AASM Hammer precision guided bombs has reached 1,200 per year, with every single one of those bombs due to be supplied to Ukraine. The Hammer has a very good inertial guidance system that allows it to still be accurate even in an environment with lots of jamming and EW. It's been a huge help for Ukraine, and the fact that France is rapidly scaling up production and sending all of them to Ukraine is really good. \n* Global economic pressure has led to falling oil prices, which will impact Russia very negatively. The price that Russian oil is selling at is already 40% below the target their budget set, and OPEC + is close to allowing members to further increase production, which would of course send oil prices even lower.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,648 (+98)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,970 (+23)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,800 (+16)\n* Russian SPG losses: 928 (+5)\n* Russian SAM losses: 323 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 140 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,805 (+54)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,167 (+8)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,353 (+3)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 902 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 542 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+0)\n\nReasonably light losses on both sides this week. It is pretty unusual, however, to see more tanks lost than IFVs on both sides. I've also noticed that Ukrainian SPG losses have been fairly high the past few months, though that could be in part because they are now producing many Bohdana SPGs domestically, meaning they don't have to be quite as careful with them. \n\nAs usual, thanks for reading, and if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them!",

How is a thrown walkie talkie able to disable a drone?\n\n  \n**Maps:** \n\nSumy last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdli1izfoswe1.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3c359e358ef4d00a350fb1e5c448712f235dd86\n\nSumy this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsawp28hoswe1.png?width=1070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=146273a4f0154a34173af638dd14c038d3da8dff\n\n* Russian forces made a small advance here towards Sumy, as they also took back the last remaining Ukrainian held territory in Kursk.\n\nKupiansk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qoi5oetsoswe1.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1149d18a78a52aa5267373f883ba65909959126\n\nKupiansk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sw8zm7fuoswe1.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbf7dcf7753e69b37d3d9cb2c25aabf40af4d44d\n\n* Russian troops advanced very slightly north of Kindrashivka, but also seem to have lost some territory southeast of the town. \n\nLyman last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u59p65v1pswe1.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e224fc74b60fbee26de04ab9f2f5897304847f96\n\nLyman this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bx6sbc3pswe1.png?width=678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2957ad2d6d88be210533d06ac055ab018a0a4606\n\n* Russia advanced very slightly north of Drobysheve, no other changes here. \n\nChasiv Yar last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18cvc0o8pswe1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecb0dfc42d5665b96fe8897f5ddf54a5d239522\n\nChasiv Yar this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9wk4wy9pswe1.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d2b485ab4378959ee55a0d1103e123354124c3\n\n* Russia has expanded the grey zone north of Chasiv Yar and within the city. \n\nPokrovsk last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbsd97nfpswe1.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=097b326990bbd51740014a2ddd26096c0b1fc788\n\nPokrvosk this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt45yn4hpswe1.png?width=1063&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e9a9272227e688eed6f3b8658b1108e4e3b3733\n\n* Ukraine has had a few more successes on this front, continuing a positive trend for them here. Some ground was retaken directly south of Pokrovsk, and also within Toretsk. The battle for Toretsk has been a horrific meat grinder for the Russians, and the fact that the fight for the city continues, and they don't even seem to have much of an upper hand, is a bad sign for them. There were also reports this week that Russian forces tried a massive motorcycle attack against Ukrainian positions near Pokrovsk, which was completely destroyed by Ukrainian troops. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed almost 100 motorcycles, 21 armored vehicles, and dozens of Russian soldiers. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7mp1rrypswe1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6815c4821a5a7737e21040352ea9c92a300310d1\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8vh9rh0qswe1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28a0241559f71dec862201c2042fdddb97270b1b\n\n* No changes here. \n\n**Peace Deal Analysis:**\n\n* The terms of the deal set out by the US between Ukraine and Russia are as follows:\n   * Official recognition of Crimea as Russian.\n   * No NATO membership for Ukraine, though EU membership is accepted.\n   * Freezing the conflict along current front lines, with some minor territory transfers (Ukraine getting some territory in Kharkiv, and Russia getting some territory in Donetsk), importantly, this would be a de facto recognition, not an official (de jure) one.\n   * Sanctions lifted on Russia.\n   * Some kind of economic cooperation agreement between Russia and the US.\n   * A \"robust\" security guarantee for Ukraine, provided by European nations, though the exact terms of this are vague. \n   * Unimpeded passage on the Dnipro river for Ukrainian ships.\n   * Compensation and assistance for rebuilding Ukraine, though the terms of this are also vague.\n   * The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant will be considered to be on Ukrainian territory, but will be operated by the US, with power supplied to Ukraine and Russia.\n* Overall, this deal is reasonably close to what I was expecting. You can look at comments I made over a year ago about the eventual resolution of the war where I sketched out something very similar to this. It favors Russia more than Ukraine, but the inclusion of EU membership, no demilitarization of Ukraine, and real security guarantees are all significant elements that don't leave Ukraine out to dry too much. \n* A lot depends on what exactly the security guarantees are. European peacekeeping contingents and a continued flow of arms to Ukraine are crucial to preserve any peace. I've seen some reports that this deal precludes any European peacekeeping forces, but I haven't seen direct confirmation of that. If it does, then it should be totally rejected. \n* It's important to remember that the chief Russian goals of the invasion were to eliminate Ukrainian sovereignty and \"de-militarize\" the country. Any deal that leaves Ukraine with control over its own government and preserves the strength of the Ukrainian military, is, in a way, a colossal loss for Russia, even though it may not feel that way, since Ukraine would still have to cede territory to Russia in response to an illegal invasion. For these reasons I also think it's unlikely that Russia will accept the deal, since accepting it would mean a tacit acknowledgement that they failed in their explicitly stated goals for the war.  \n* I also think it's unlikely Ukraine will accept the deal, since they have written into their constitution that they can't cede any territory to Russia. \n* This is a great example of the problem of justice vs. peace, similar in some ways to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Ukraine wants justice, while the US wants peace. You can certainly make the case that peace without justice is wrong. But if you look at how that policy has worked out for the Palestinians, you get the sense that at some point, sacrificing your people for the sake of land is also wrong. There aren't any good options here unfortunately, and in some ways, this kind of deal represents one of the least bad options. To keep fighting the war for another couple of years, Ukraine will certainly have to further lower their age of conscription. They already have a huge demographic problem and comparatively very few young people, so having to send those 18- and 19-year-olds to the front line would really hurt the country's prospects going forward. I do think it would be worth it to sacrifice Donetsk and Luhansk to save those young people, though that is obviously an extraordinarily bitter pill to swallow. \n* The bottom line for me is, when you are fighting against someone much stronger than you, you have to accept that survival is the most important victory. This deal, if it did include peacekeeping forces, would allow Ukraine to survive. I'd love to be in a world where Ukraine is able to take back the territory they've lost. But unfortunately, we haven't seen any indication that they are capable of that. And waiting on the Russian military to collapse is not a winning bet. Ask Napoleon or Hitler how that worked out for them. \n\n**Events this Week:** \n\n* In a grim continuation of a recent trend, Russia launched a massive drone and missile strike against Ukraine, including attacks that explicitly targeted civilians, which is a war crime. At least 9 people were killed, and many more wounded. This attack did prompt Trump to angrily post on social media \"Vladimir, STOP!\" He has publicly expressed his frustration with Putin more than once, and a part of me still holds out for the day when he may finally realize that trying to work with Putin is a fool's errand. But he and JD Vance also posted more false and incredibly stupid criticisms of Zelensky and said that if the proposed deal isn't agreed to soon, the US will fully step away from the conflict. \n* A massive explosion occurred at Russia's 51st GRAU arsenal close to Moscow. It's unclear if the explosion was because of a Ukrainian attack, sabotage, or simply a mistake. But the damage and fires are clearly visible on satellite imagery, so this was a very powerful explosion. Some sources have claimed that over 100,000 tons of ammunition were destroyed.\n* Putin announced a farce Easter truce last weekend that was immediately violated hundreds of times by his own forces. \n* Reuters reported this week that small groups of officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army have arrived in Ukraine behind Russian lines to observe conditions and gather information. These officers are not fighting in the war but are there to signal Chinese support for Russia and help the Chinese military learn lessons from the war. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,470 (+145)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,938 (+21)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,874 (+58)\n* Russian SPG losses: 918 (+1)\n* Russian SAM losses: 320 (+1)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 139 (+0)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (+0)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,678 (+77)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,156 (+5)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,326 (+11)\n* Ukrainian IMV losses: 886 (+11)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 529 (+7)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 171 (+1)\n\nLighter losses on both sides this week, though Russia losses are still fairly bad. Ukrainian ones are mostly back to normal.\n\nThanks for reading! ",

For many Ukrainians, though, Trump’s demands are not only unrealistic but a threat to the very existence of their country. As he pushes hard for a peace deal before his 100th day in office, Trump has taken a sledgehammer approach to diplomacy, threatening to walk away entirely from negotiations and attacking President Zelensky’s refusal to acknowledge Russian rule in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that was annexed in 2014.\n\n“It’s inflammatory statements like Zelensky’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday. He said that Crimea had been “lost years ago” and that its status was “not even a point of discussion”.\n\nFor Kyiv, the recognition of Russia’s seizure of Crimea would set a “dangerous precedent” and only encourage President Putin’s appetite for Ukrainian lands, according to Volodymyr Fesenko, a political analyst who is seen as close to Zelensky’s administration. Although Trump’s peace proposal has not been published by the White House, a draft copy that was seen by Axios, an American media outlet, says that it would involve Washington formally recognising Russian control over Crimea and acknowledging its de facto rule in four regions in the east and south of Ukraine. Fesenko said: “If we have to choose between recognising Crimea as Russian and the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process, then Ukraine is more likely to be prepared for the US to pull out of the talks. For Ukraine, this is the lesser of two evils.\n\n“Of course, these are potential risks for Ukraine in this. But we must understand that the risk of recognising \\[Russian control of\\] Crimea is much greater and more long-term than the risk of the United States withdrawing from the negotiation process. Crimea is a very serious and very fundamental issue for us. If the Americans agree to this, then after some time Putin will almost inevitably demand recognition of the rest of the annexed territories.”\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump said that Zelensky was not being asked to recognise Crimea as Russian territory. However, he suggested that he expected some kind of commitment from Zelensky that Ukraine would no longer challenge the Kremlin’s rule over the peninsula, a stunningly beautiful region where Soviet leaders once took their holidays. “If he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?” Trump wrote. He also appeared to repeat one of Putin’s justifications for seizing Crimea, writing that it had been home to Russian submarine bases “for many years”.\n\nPutin has said that Russia was forced to seize Crimea to prevent Sevastopol, the home of its Black Sea fleet, from falling under Nato’s control after a pro-western government came to power in Kyiv in 2014.",

Trump’s abrupt reversal of the Biden administration’s support for Kyiv in favour of improving ties with Russia has already made him deeply unpopular in Ukraine. His efforts to pressure Zelensky on Crimea have now provoked open contempt.\n\nIllia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist, wrote on X: “This insane plan to blackmail and twist Ukraine’s arm — a scheme as foolish as it is detached from reality — will go down as one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of global diplomacy.” But not everyone is ready to write off Trump and his administration just yet. “Of course we are not going to give up on the United States, because the situation can change,” Merezhko said. “We need to work with Trump. Who knows, maybe he will come to his senses at some point.”",

        "body": "### Zelensky accuses Trump’s envoy of ‘spreading Russian narratives’\nTamila Tasheva, an MP who was Zelensky’s permanent representative for Crimea until last year, warned that “trading territory for a ceasefire” would not bring a lasting peace. “On the contrary, it could serve as a foundation for renewed aggression,” she said. “A precedent of conceding land to an aggressor would have far-reaching consequences for both regional and global security. The past 11 years of the occupation [of Crimea] have shown that partial concessions do not lead to de-escalation. Russia does not interpret them as compromise but rather as weakness.”\n\nFesenko said, however, that Trump’s threats and pressure on Ukraine could be part of a “psychological attack” by the White House aimed at extracting massive concessions from Kyiv in the shortest possible time. “So we have to wait it out, and hold out until Trump’s mood changes,” he said.\nAlthough Zelensky has admitted that Ukraine is not at present strong enough to liberate Crimea and other Russian-occupied territories by force, he has said that Kyiv will strive to return them through diplomatic efforts. He has also said that Ukraine will discuss wider issues on how on resolve the war only after a full ceasefire has come into effect across the 600-mile front, a proposal that Moscow has not agreed to.\n\nCrimea has held strategic importance in Europe for millennia. At the time of the ancient Greeks it was a boundary between the classical world and the untamed steppe. The Crimean Khanate, a Tatar successor state of the Golden Horde, was the primary power in the region for hundreds of years until Catherine the Great’s Russian Empire won the territory in a war with the Ottoman Empire in the late 18th century.\n\nRussia’s ambitions in the wider region met opposition from other big powers, including Britain, in an episode that culminated the in the Crimean War in the 1850s. During the Soviet period, Crimean Tatars were oppressed and deported to central Asia under Stalin, and Crimea was the setting of the Yalta talks that sought to reorder Europe after the Second World War. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred the peninsula from the Russian Soviet Republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1954. It is recognised as a part of Ukraine by a large majority of nations to this day.\nEven if Ukraine wanted to hand over Crimea to Russia, though, there would be significant legal obstacles. According to the Ukrainian constitution, Crimea is an inseparable part of Ukraine and the government has no legal right to sign it away without a two-thirds majority vote in parliament and the approval of the Ukrainian people in a referendum. Another complication is that neither referendums nor elections can be held under martial law, which was introduced in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in 2022.\n\n“Ukraine will always act in accordance with its constitution,” Zelensky wrote, in an apparent response to Trump’s comments. He also posted on social media a “Crimea declaration” from 2018 by Mike Pompeo, then Trump’s secretary of state, which said Washington “rejects Russia’s attempted annexation of Crimea”. Oleksandr Merezhko, an MP who heads the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said it was possible that Trump was putting forward “absurd” demands as a deliberate negotiating tactic and that he would lower them if Kyiv held firm. “This is the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic scenario is that [Trump] understands that Ukraine will never agree to recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea as legal and this is all a pretext to walk away from negotiations and to blame Ukraine instead of Russia.”\n\nAlthough the White House peace plan is reported to say that Ukraine would get “a robust security guarantee” from its allies in Europe and elsewhere, there were no details on how a peacekeeping operation would function and no mention of any direct involvement by the United States. It also ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine. “We need security guarantees, because without them this is a just a delayed death for us,” Merezhko said. “We need a guarantee of our survival.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, perhaps, Ukraine has been reluctant even to discuss the plan, under which sanctions of Russia would also be lifted. In return, aside from the vague security guarantees, Kyiv would get back a small part of land that Russia has occupied in the Kharkiv region, unimpeded passage of the Dnipro river — especially in the Kherson region, where Russian forces are on the riverbank — and promises of compensation and assistance to rebuild.",

When the Soviet Union collapsed, the declaration's legacy helped the Baltic states re-establish their independence and gain international recognition.\n\n&gt;In the context of Crimea, the Welles Declaration serves as a historical precedent for the principle of non-recognition of territorial changes achieved through force.

It's about ego more than money. It's about beating or crushing his opponent. And equally: he is a junkie. That would explain why he loses interest soon after a deal is made - mineral deal with Afghanistan for example - AND why he breaks deals to remake them bigger and 'better' - Canada Mexico for example. As soon as his high wears off, he needs another hit. It is never enough to satisfy. And the more dominant alpha/crushing that he can be - the better his fix but then he will always need an even bigger hit. \n\nMoney? It's not as important. If it were, he probably wouldn't have gone bankrupt as often as he has. And he wouldn't lose interest so quickly after a deal is made. He very often fails with any follow through that is required for making money from his deals - even when a lot of money could be made. The Afghanistan mineral deal is a great example of this. Very soon after striking that deal, he threw the Afghans under the bus - completely sidelined them and made a deal with the Taliban... and we all know what was the result of that.\n\nAnd of course that means he is the absolute worst type of person to make a deal with because he will never fill his cravings and he will always want to redo the deal in even more domineering ways (UA mineral deal for example - as soon as UA was on the verge of agreeing he massively upped his demands - he just wasn't getting enough of his drug). It seems to me that this is the perfect addiction for a narcissist. \n\nI imagine that not being able to make deals absolutely enrages him beyond any reason, too.  \n\nThat's my latest read on trump anyway for what it is worth.",

    "selftext": "There seems to be a notable pattern where major Ukrainian battlefield successes—such as the destruction of the large ammunition depot in Russia’s Vladimir region—are quickly followed by renewed pressure from Donald Trump and his team for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and an unfavorable peace deal.\n\n# Timeline and Coincidence\n\n* On April 22, 2025, a huge explosion destroyed one of Russia’s largest munitions depots near Moscow, causing a significant loss of ammunition and likely further straining Russia’s already stretched logistics[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html).\n* Almost immediately, U.S. officials, including Trump’s envoy, convened with Ukrainian and European representatives in London to push Trump’s “final offer” peace proposal, which would require Ukraine to accept U.S. recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian occupation in several other regions[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html)[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Nature of the Peace Proposal\n\n* The proposal is widely seen as highly favorable to Russia: it offers Russia tangible gains (recognition of annexed territories, a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, lifting of sanctions) while Ukraine receives only vague security promises and limited territorial returns[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[4](https://nypost.com/2025/04/23/world-news/heres-what-russia-and-ukraine-get-in-trumps-final-offer-peace-deal/)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n* The plan was drafted after Trump’s envoy met with Putin for several hours, fueling perceptions that the proposal is essentially written to satisfy Russian objectives[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Ukrainian Response and International Context\n\n* President Zelensky and Ukrainian officials have categorically rejected the proposal, as it would require Ukraine to accept the loss of sovereign territory and abandon its NATO ambitions, both of which are politically and constitutionally unacceptable in Ukraine[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIt seems more than coincidental that every time Ukraine achieves a significant battlefield victory, such as the Vladimir ammunition depot explosion, there is a renewed and urgent push from Trump and his team for Ukraine to accept a ceasefire and a deal that heavily favors Russian interests. This pattern supports the perception in Kyiv and among observers that the U.S. peace push is less about supporting Ukraine’s position and more about freezing the conflict before Ukraine can capitalize further on its military momentum[1](https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-destroys-ammunition-dump-190102450.html)[2](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas)[3](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/trump-s-final-offer-axios-reveals-peace-plan-1745375531.html)[5](https://kyivindependent.com/final-draft-of-trumps-peace-plan-requires-ukraine-to-accept-russian-occupation-axios-reports/).\n\n# Citations:\n\n1.

    "selftext": "Our (Danish) media has published a good article outlining the timeline of Trumps \"negotiations\" and how he's faltering. I just had to share it.\n\n[https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-04-22-trump-kan-vaere-ved-at-stemple-ud-mener-analytiker](https://nyheder.tv2.dk/udland/2025-04-22-trump-kan-vaere-ved-at-stemple-ud-mener-analytiker)\n\nTranslation via chatGPT:\n\n**Analyst: Trump May Be Tapping Out**\n\nOn Friday, the statement first came from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and shortly thereafter it was confirmed by President Trump: If Russia or Ukraine prove to be “difficult” and refuse to enter a peace agreement, the U.S. will soon withdraw from the peace negotiations and focus on other matters.\n\nAlthough Trump describes himself as the master of all negotiations and for months guaranteed peace within 24 hours of taking office, an agreement still seems illusory. Granted, the 24-hour peace guarantee was later changed to 100 days, but fundamentally, Trump’s envoys have not brought the parties any closer together.\n\nIn short, things have gone wrong because Trump overplayed his hand. He interpreted the situation as if he and Putin held all the strong cards. Back during the bizarre scene in the Oval Office, where the press conference with President Zelensky ended in an argument, Trump shouted, “You don’t have the cards.” That was a misreading. Ukraine *does* have cards, and Trump has managed to play his own hand weakly in front of Putin. That’s why things are falling apart.\n\n**No Aces Up the Sleeve in London**\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, the U.S., Ukraine, France, and the UK will meet in London, and nothing suggests that Trump has any aces up his sleeve. On the contrary, the latest reports from the *Wall Street Journal* indicate that the Trump team is being forced to propose an unrealistic plan.\n\nAccording to the newspaper’s sources, the Trump administration’s proposal now is that Ukraine should cede Crimea to Russia and give up any prospect of joining NATO. Furthermore, the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia should be placed under U.S. control.\n\nThe proposal does not mention what is to happen with the four partially occupied provinces—Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson—which Putin has had written into Russia’s constitution and thus lays claim to. Nor are there any security guarantees for Ukraine. In other words, Ukraine must make concessions but gets nothing tangible in return.\n\nEven the first demand—to give up Crimea—is completely unrealistic. Ukraine is a democracy, and it would require a constitutional amendment that is unlikely to gain support. If Zelensky were to accept this demand, it would likely be political suicide and would strengthen Ukrainian nationalism. It would be like asking a Danish prime minister to give up Bornholm.\n\nWith security guarantees and temporary status for parts of the occupied areas, there might be a chance.\n\n**Europe Is a Trump Card for Ukraine**\n\nSince the beginning of Trump’s so-called “peace negotiations,” the strategy has been to try to strong-arm Ukraine into submission. Trump wanted to force the party he believed held the weak hand at the table to surrender.\n\nHad Ukraine stood completely isolated, that strategy might have had a chance. But Ukraine is not isolated. Trump underestimated the support Ukraine has received from European countries as well as from Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. Among NATO’s 32 members, only the U.S. and Hungary have chosen to follow Trump’s course.\n\nTrump has therefore underestimated Europe’s willingness to collectively back Ukraine. The many summits called at short notice in various European capitals with different country constellations in recent months have shown this support.\n\nThey all agree that only Ukraine itself can decide whether to give up territory and that any agreement would be unsustainable without robust security guarantees. The UK and France will almost certainly maintain that stance at the London meeting. Europeans know that conceding to Putin’s territorial demands will only lead to more demands and would be a ticking time bomb under Europe’s security.\n\n**Trump Has Strengthened Putin’s Hand**\n\nBecause of Trump’s misreading of the situation, he has, since taking power, handed many valuable cards to Putin. This includes issues such as territorial concessions, NATO membership, security guarantees, support for Russia in the UN, and fully adopting Russia’s narrative of the war. All of these trump cards have been given to Putin without Trump demanding anything in return.\n\nParallel to the peace negotiations over Ukraine, Trump has even initiated talks on normalizing relations between the U.S. and Russia—both diplomatically and economically, with Trump’s lead negotiator, Steve Witkoff, openly highlighting how lucrative the Trump administration sees opportunities in Russia.\n\nTherefore, Putin has had no incentive to make a single compromise on Ukraine. His war aim of gaining control over all of Ukraine remains intact. He knows that Trump is more focused on lucrative deals than on defending international law, Ukraine’s survival as an independent state, and Europe’s security.\n\n**War Is Much More Than a Card Game**\n\nIf we rewind to that scandalous evening in the Oval Office, Zelensky tried to interject, “This is not about playing cards.” Trump didn’t listen. But the war is indeed about much more than three parties at a card table, where the nearly 40 million Ukrainians are the weak party, supposedly forced to capitulate.\n\nTrump could, for instance, have listened when NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Cavoli, testified before Congress on April 3. There, the U.S. top general in Europe explained that Ukraine is actually holding up fairly well in the war. They have been under pressure but have resolved many of their military challenges. They are far from losing.\n\nMost recently, Secretary Rubio announced that he will not attend the Wednesday meeting in London. This suggests that Trump may be giving up on the effort and tapping out. Regardless of the realities, Ukraine will likely be blamed for the collapse.",

The measures include asset freezes, trade restrictions, bans on property acquisition, termination of licenses and permits, and transit prohibitions.\n\nOn April 17, Zelensky previewed the move, announcing that \"two important packages of sanctions will be introduced tomorrow against Kremlin propagandists and Iskander missile manufacturers.\"\n\nAmong those sanctioned are Ukrainian-born actor and singer Nikita Dzhigurda, Soviet-era clown Yuri Kuklachyov, and Russian actor Oskar Kuchera, all of whom publicly supported Russian aggression against Ukraine.",

Russia did take some ground to the southwest of Toretsk, however. \n\nZaporizhzhia last week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hr59tp4meve1.png?width=1195&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77382be71a7df53f4c5afcbdfeeec405f7d392cd\n\nZaporizhzhia this week: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gtogw8p6meve1.png?width=1210&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83ab910e56d06db02db03dd10f15a7484e994fd8\n\n* Russia made some gains north of Velyka Novosilka.\n\n**Events this Week:** \n\n* Russia hit the city of Sumy with a missile strike that killed over 30 civilians. There isn't really any way to explain this strike other than as an act of terror. But that didn't stop Trump from trying to explain it away as a \"mistake,\" while denigrating Zelensky and blaming him once again for starting the war even though there is no truth to that claim whatsoever. He did that in the context of saying he wouldn't send Zelensky crucial Patriot batteries and missiles that Ukraine uses to defend their civilian population, even though Zelensky offered to pay billions of dollars for them. \n* The Trump administration, did, however, extend the sanctions package against Russia that was created by Biden. The State Department is also allegedly considering options to expand sanctions. This lines up with what we know about the factions within the Trump administration, where the envoy to Russia Steve Witkoff represents the pro-Russian faction, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg represent the pro-Ukraine faction. It feels like each faction gains and loses influence on a week to week basis, though it's also clear that Trump favors Witkoff more than Kellogg and Rubio, since he is constantly repeating false claims that come from Witkoff. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Witkoff is an absolute clown who is being repeatedly humiliated and played by the Russians. We'll know the Trump administration is serious about peace when Witkoff gets the boot. \n* It seems that after years of waffling, Germany may finally send Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. It will be too little too late even if they do get sent, but that's still a positive development. Germany also sent over a new batch of aid including new Howitzers, ammunition for artillery and Gepard anti-air vehicles, and a bunch of ground radars, presumably for detecting drones, among other equipment. \n* More information has come out about the scale of North Korean assistance to Russia. At this point, it's likely that a majority of the artillery shells they fire are North Korean. They've also received large numbers of guided missiles, multiple launch rocket systems, and other equipment. But the artillery ammunition in particular has been absolutely crucial for keeping Russia in the war. North Korea is rapidly converting more and more factories to produce ammunition. They have apparently profited at least $20 billion dollars from this assistance, on top of whatever technology transfers they have received, and the valuable experience their troops have gained from fighting. \n* Some progress has allegedly been made on the US-Ukraine minerals deal, with the US dropping some of our more insane demands and lowering the amount of money the deal is supposed to pay the US back from $300 billion to $100 billion. \n* Ukraine unveiled a new \"missile-drone\" called Bars that is a relatively cheap and easily producible cruise missile with a decent range of about 7 to 800km. This isn't going to be comparable to a top of the line cruise missile like the Storm Shadow, but it's not supposed to be. It will be a great tool for saturating Russian air defenses and creating space for better things like Storm Shadow to operate. \n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,325 (+197)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,917 (+32)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,816 (+79)\n* Russian SPG losses: 917 (+8)\n* Russian SAM losses: 319 (+6)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 139 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 155 (-1)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,601 (+93)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,151 (+13)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,315 (-80, Oryx must have cleaned up their data a bit)\n* Ukrainian IMV (Infantry Mobility Vehicle) losses: 875 (+13)\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 522 (+8)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 170 (+0)\n\nAnother week of devastatingly heavy losses for Russia. They've lost more than an entire brigade's worth of vehicles in the last two weeks alone. Ukraine is still taking higher losses than average, but nowhere near Russian levels. Based on the number of destroyed armored vehicles Russia has lost in the past two weeks, it doesn't seem like their offensive is going very well so far. \n\nThanks for reading!",

It's not some experimental platform; it's an evolution of a combat-proven system, incorporating modern components like the GF300 radar.\n\n\nSo no, it's not a case of choosing between a mature system and an untested one. It’s more a matter of whether you go for a European, modular system that’s faster to deploy, or stick with a legacy platform that’s widely used but comes at a higher cost.",

    "selftext": "Peace is out of reach for Ukraine due to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ongoing aggression, European defense ministers stressed Friday, even as the United States pushed ahead with talks with Moscow.\n\nTop Trump administration official Steve Witkoff met Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, shaking hands with Putin at the start.\n\nPutin and Witkoff were set to discuss Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ahead of the meeting, which ended at 10 p.m. Moscow time (3 p.m. ET), according to Russian state media TASS.\n\nPeskov had referred to the assembly as “a good opportunity” to convey the Russian position to Trump. A possible Putin-Trump meeting may also be on the agenda, state news agency RIA Novosti cited Peskov as saying.\n\n“The painstaking work continues. Naturally, Witkoff, as a special representative of (US President Donald) Trump, will convey something from his president to Putin. Putin will listen to it. The conversation will continue on various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement,” Peskov said, state media TASS reported.\n\nWitkoff, who is Trump’s foreign envoy, also met Friday with Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev in St. Petersburg, according to RIA Novosti. Dmitriev later described those discussions as “productive” in a post on X on Friday.\n\n# ‘Russia is the sole cause of this war’\n\nThe US meetings in Russia come as Ukraine’s key allies gathered Friday in Brussels, where the defense ministers of the United Kingdom and Germany emphasized that Putin has continued his aggression against both military and civilian targets despite claiming to want peace.\n\nThe Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting was co-hosted by the UK and Germany, with a noticeable absence at the table: US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who only attended virtually.\n\nThe group of roughly 50 nations, which was created by former US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during the Biden administration, meets regularly to discuss bolstering military support for Ukraine.\n\n“Given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said in a news conference immediately after the meeting, speaking alongside the Ukrainian and British ministers.\n\n“We will ensure that Ukraine continues to benefit from our joint military support. Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it,” added Pistorius.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made a virtual appearance, where he warned the past month had made it “completely clear” that “Russia is the sole cause of this war.”\n\nHe made explicit reference to Putin’s refusal to accept a US-proposed ceasefire in March. “Without strength against Russia, there will be no will in Russia to accept and implement any realistic and effective proposals for peace,” he said.\n\nBritish Defense Secretary John Healey also noted that “today is one month to the day in which Russia rejected President Trump’s peace settlement.”\n\n“Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. Putin said he wanted peace, but he continues to drag his feet and delay negotiations. Putin said he wanted peace, but his forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike,” Healey said.\n\nFriday’s meeting marks the first time a senior Pentagon official has not attended in person since the group was established in 2022 just months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which comes amid a series of policy shifts by the Trump administration seen as moving closer to Moscow.\n\nIt came as Trump’s envoy to Ukraine suggested Kyiv would have to cede its eastern territories to achieve a peace deal with Moscow, in remarks that would likely alarm Western allies and leaders in Kyiv.\n\nGeneral Keith Kellogg, a former national security adviser, said Ukraine could be divided “almost like Berlin after World War Two,” in an interview with British newspaper The Times, published Friday. British and French troops could engage zones of control in western Ukraine as part of a “reassurance force,” with Russian troops occupying the east, he added. Kyiv’s forces would line the space in between, alongside a demilitarized zone, he said.\n\nIn a post on X, Kellogg later said that he had been referring to potential “zones of responsibility for an allied force” rather than the partitioning of Ukraine, and emphasized that the idea did not foresee US troops on the ground.\n\nWitkoff, another senior Trump aide, has touted the view that Ukraine would need to give up the four regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – to see an end to the war, indicating a stunning policy departure from the previous administration.\n\n# ‘A matter of priorities’\n\nGermany’s Pistorius said ahead of the Brussels meeting it was the Trump administration’s decision to attend virtually and was “not his business” to comment on the signal that sends.\n\n“It’s not a matter of priorities. I think it’s a matter of schedules,” Pistorius added.\n\nAhead of the meeting, the British defense minister offered strong words of support for Ukraine and called for putting “even more pressure on Putin.”\n\n“Our commitment is to put Ukraine in the strongest position to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty and deter future Russian aggression,” Healey said in a statement.\n\nNew pledges of military aid announced after Friday’s meeting total more than €21 billion euros ($23.8 billion), Healey announced, calling it “a record boost in military funding for Ukraine.”\n\nGermany will provide a further €11 billion ($12.5 billion) in military support to Ukraine through 2029, including IRIS-T mobile air defense missile systems and PATRIOT missiles, Ukraine’s defense minister said Friday from Brussels.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Norway will also jointly give an additional $589 million in military aid, to provide maintenance to vehicles, radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones.\n\nAir defense is Kyiv’s priority, Zelensky said ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe absence of US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, pictured at Thurday's cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, will mark the first time since the group’s founding three years ago that a senior Pentagon official will not. Nathan Howard/Reuters\n\n“We just need to address the shortage of air defense systems to make our sky protection stronger,” Zelensky said. “Our partners can help with this and also speed up the implementation of all agreements reached earlier. Patriots that remain unused in storage with our partners should be protecting lives.”\n\nZelensky said earlier this week that Russia was “preparing” a new offensive, as CNN reported that Russia’s army has increased operations across the front line in recent weeks.\n\nUkraine’s military chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told Ukrainian media on Thursday that Russia has “already begun” its new offensive against the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.\n\nMeanwhile, a new United Nations report revealed this week that Ukraine experienced a significant increase in civilian casualties from Russian attacks in March.\n\nThe number of civilian casualties was 50% higher than the previous month, with at least 164 people killed and 910 injured in March, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Friday’s meeting was the first without a US defense secretary present. It is the first that a senior Pentagon official has not attended in person.\n\nCNN’s Mariya Knight, Matthew Chance, Svitlana Vlasova, Clare Sebastian, Catherine Nicholls and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.",

Born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. My grandparents came to America after escaping Russian aggression during and prior to WW2. My great grandfather was tied to the railroad tracks and murdered in Siberia. My grandfather served in the Russian army and was used as cannon fodder. The reason I am writing you is because I am disappointed in your actions as an American and a Ukrainian. Just because you are born in Kyiv does not make you Ukrainian. You are clearly a representative of Putin. You represent evil and terrorism. Please do not represent yourself as a Ukrainian or an American. You can let the world know you stand with Russia.  \n \nI look forward to watching you lose your reelection bid. You mentioned President Volodymyr Zelensky insulted Americans, President Zelensky is a hero! YOU insult the people of American and Ukraine. YOU insult freedom and democracy! YOU insult those fighting for good vs evil. Roman Hrybov stated to the Russian warship “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” I’d like to end this letter with: Congresswoman Victoria Spartz Go Fuck Yourself! \n \nBest regards,\n\n\n",

I am writing to you as a proud Ukrainian-American, born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. My family’s history is deeply intertwined with the struggles faced by Ukrainians, as my grandparents escaped Russian aggression during and prior to World War II. My great-grandfather suffered a tragic fate, and my grandfather served in the Russian army under difficult circumstances.\n\nI wanted to express my disappointment regarding your recent actions and statements. While I understand that your background includes being born in Kyiv, I feel that your current representation does not align with the values many of us hold dear as both Americans and Ukrainians. It is concerning to see what appears to be support for actions that many view as detrimental to our shared ideals of freedom and democracy.\n\nI believe that President Volodymyr Zelensky embodies the spirit of resilience and courage, and I think it’s important to recognize the efforts of those fighting for justice. I sincerely hope you will reflect on your position and consider the impact it has on both our communities.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to seeing how you choose to represent our shared values in the future.\n\nBest regards,",

Ukrainian defenses here are said to be very strong, so I don't think they will achieve much, and it's probably good that the troops here aren't being transferred to the Donbas.\n\nKupiansk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8b0uq8com0ue1.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d6d3b0c3596ac2634877aaf549bfd774b5ebc9\n\nKupiansk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5up37mpm0ue1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5beffc53bcae39420bd0293a74c53cee1f7ebc95\n\n* No changes here this week.\n\nLyman last week (re-named from Kreminna to correctly show the focus of the front here):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whbfy6nwm0ue1.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b071a5bc87328f8add4bdc77e945a39705686461\n\nLyman this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gfkej1zm0ue1.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b11c37ca5e818a0bfd8819327e6c75466ab366\n\n* Russian forces have been making threatening advances here as part of their push to re-take the town of Lyman, which they seized in 2022 and then lost in the Kharkiv counter-offensive. Lyman is a key logistics hub. Fortunately, this week, Russia has not made confirmed gains here, but the whole area is in danger.\n\nChasiv Yar last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ga6l5bg9n0ue1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c594de9d86ca95dfe8b6ed272be9b86d189f780\n\nChasiv Yar this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjt1tnwan0ue1.png?width=879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5377442e4e790669e8562d9f3735e7588efb837\n\n* No changes here.\n\nPokrovsk last week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8yzfqden0ue1.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21dfab3c3a4f16c66f51777825bf8416f9320742\n\nPokrovsk this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vsks8mufn0ue1.png?width=1069&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb19a5e199d4a4cfb3dbd6aaf4e0a7780457939c\n\n* Russia has re-taken a fair amount of territory within Toretsk, and also appears to have sent a spearhead out of the city relatively deep into Ukrainian lines. I am skeptical that such a long, thin advance can be maintained, but we'll see. This is certainly a reversal of fortune for Ukrainian forces within Toretsk, unfortunately. Ukraine does appear to have further pushed back Russian forces within the Pokrovsk salient, so it's not all bad here this week.\n\nZaporizhzhia last week (renamed from Velyka Novosilka to more accurately represent this front):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39b2zenun0ue1.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25415ac3e013484d957faa5843e0cdaccea64a82\n\nZaporizhzhia this week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kficv5wn0ue1.png?width=1195&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ffd6360011ae0a9c1a038fbde82ae6567d7043\n\n* Russia slightly expanded the grey zone north of Velyka Novosilka, no changes besides that.\n\n**Events this Week:**\n\n* Zelensky claimed that up to 155 Chinese nationals have been fighting in Ukraine, and a few of them have been captured already. China has denied that any of its soldiers are fighting there. These troops are likely soldiers of fortune who are in Ukraine to make money, rather than officially representing any kind of Chinese policy to fight in Ukraine. Zelensky is likely highlighting these troops as a way to show how close Russia is with China and associate them together in Trump's mind.\n* Ukrainian forces claimed to have destroyed a Russian Tu-22 bomber in a drone attack. Russia doesn't have many Tu-22s and is unable to build more of them.\n* Ukrainian forces also claimed to have destroyed or damaged up to 4 Buk air defense systems in a series of attacks, one of the more successful strikes on Russian AD assets if true.\n* Another successful Ukrainian strike targeted the biggest fiber optic plant in Russia, wreaking extensive damage to it. Fiber optic drones have become a very important capability in this war, and so disrupting Russia's ability to build more fiber optic cables is really smart.\n* Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian Army Syrskyi claimed that the Russian spring offensive has already begun, with Sumy and Kharkiv being the primary axes of advance.\n* Reported oil and gas revenues from Russia have dropped by 17%, a big drop that will hamper Russia's ability to fund the war. Oil prices have also dropped greatly in the past week, which puts even more pressure on the Russian budget.\n* The Economist published a few interesting reports on Ukraine this week, including an article where Ukrainian officials claimed they are confident they will be able to hold off Russian advances for the foreseeable future due to the vast number of drones they are able to produce and use effectively. Another report claimed that with increased European assistance, which is due to be around 40 billion Euros in 2025, Ukraine is likely to produce as many as 5 million FPV drones and 3,000 cruise missiles, which are both massive numbers. This aligns with Europe's goal of turning Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine.\"\n* Ukrainian officials reported that it has become more difficult to shoot down certain types of Russian drones and ballistic missiles, as the Russians have made improvements to these systems to allow them to be more unpredictable, and thus harder to shoot down. Ukraine and its allies are working to update their own systems to be able to deal with this, but these processes always take time. It's a constant game of cat and mouse.\n* The wife of top Ukrainian intelligence officer Budanov, Marianna Budanova, was apparently poisoned by Russian spies in an assassination attempt almost two years ago and has had to receive emergency treatment in the US to save her life.\n* Norway announced a significant increase in aid to Ukraine for 2025, bringing their total planned amount for this year to almost $8 billion, a large amount of money for one country to give.\n\n**Oryx Numbers:**\n\n* Total Russian vehicle losses: 21,128 (+228)\n* Russian tank losses: 3,885 (+56)\n* Russian IFV losses: 5,737 (+72)\n* Russian SPG losses: 909 (+9)\n* Russian SAM losses: 313 (+3)\n* Russian Naval losses: 28 (+0)\n* Russian Aircraft losses: 138 (+1)\n* Russian Helicopter losses: 156 (+4)\n* Total Ukrainian vehicle losses: 8,508 (+187)\n* Ukrainian tank losses: 1,138 (+20)\n* Ukrainian IFV losses: 1,395 (+27)\n* (NEW) Ukrainian Infantry Mobility Vehicles (IMV - a key category which includes Humvee variants and similar vehicles): 862\n* Ukrainian SPG losses: 514 (+12)\n* Ukrainian SAM losses: 170 (+0)\n\nVery high losses on both sides this week, thought the Russians got it worse, with a devastating 56 tanks and 72 IFVs lost, two of the highest numbers in those categories we've seen so far. That represents the loss of most of a brigade's worth of armored vehicles in one week.\n\nThanks for reading!",

A lot of siberia is dominated by native Siberians, migrant steppe people from central Asia, and the Chinese/Mongolians. \n\nIt shouldn't be weird that they would get foreigners to fight your enemy for you because they did the same thing in Afghanistan, they pulled out all of their Kazakhs and other central Asians and started using Russians to fight the Afghans since racial and cultural divide can make it easier and less demoralising to pull the trigger.",

If you go over land to reach Ukraine's interior, it is easy to stop.\n\nBy going over the Black Sea, they can fly right up at high altitude to Odesa or any coastal target without facing defence.\n\nBut that isn't even the worst part.\n\nTheir new strategy are drone and missile swarms. \n\nSo they come up, undetected and undefended. Once they're in range, they drop an overwhelming amount of ordinance all at once, overpowering the defences of Ukraine. \n\nSadly, Turkey will not allow any sort of military presence to enter through the Bosphorous, so sea-based defence platforms provided by the USA or EU cannot enter. It would be possible to send smaller ships via European rivers, but those lack the capabilities to intercept these kinds of attacks.",
